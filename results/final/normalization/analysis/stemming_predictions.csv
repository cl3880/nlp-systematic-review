28419337,Targeted Embolization of Aneurysms Associated With Brain Arteriovenous Malformations at High Risk for Surgical Resection: A Case-Control Study.,"BACKGROUND: High-risk components of brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVMs) can be targeted to reduce the risk of lesion rupture. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate targeted embolization of aneurysms against other means of treatment with a case-control analysis; we previously investigated this approach associated with BAVMs. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients with BAVMs was performed, identifying patients treated with intention to occlude only an aneurysm associated with a BAVM. For each targeted aneurysm embolization (TAE) patient identified, 4 control patients were randomly selected, controlling for rupture status, age, and Spetzler-Martin plus Lawton-Young supplemental score. Analysis was performed to compare rates of adverse events (hemorrhage, new seizure, and death) between the 2 groups. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients met inclusion criteria, and 128 control patients were identified, out of 1103 patients treated during the study period. Thirty-four adverse events occurred (15 ruptures, 15 new seizures, and 11 deaths) during the follow-up period (mean 1157 d for the TAE cohort and 1036 d for the non-TAE cohort). Statistically lower associations were noted for the TAE group for any adverse event (hazard ratio 0.28, P = .037) and the composite outcome of hemorrhage or new seizure (hazard ratio 0.20, P = .029). CONCLUSION: For BAVMs at high risk for surgical resection, TAE can be performed safely and effectively. Patients treated with TAE had better outcomes than matched patients undergoing other combinations of treatment. TAE can be considered for BAVMs with high operative risk prior to radiosurgery or when no other treatment options are available.",2018 Mar 1,2018,Neurosurgery,82,3,343-349,eng,False,10.1093/neuros/nyx167;3610993;nyx167;10.1093/neuros/nyx167,Journal Article;Multicenter Study,"Adult;Aged;Case-Control Studies;Cohort Studies;Embolization, Therapeutic/*methods;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Aneurysm/diagnosis/epidemiology/*therapy;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/epidemiology/*therapy;Male;Middle Aged;Postoperative Complications/epidemiology/prevention & control;Radiosurgery/*methods;Random Allocation;Retrospective Studies;Risk Factors",,False,0.44737024919241725,True
8811657,Stereotactically guided cavernous malformation surgery.,"The incidence of a significant hemorrhage in the natural history of cavernomas is below 1% per year, but the risk of a second hemorrhage in patients with initial bleeding cavernomas is between 14% and 29%. In the light of these figures, all cavernomas ought to be resected if surgical-related morbidity can be minimized. Stereotactically guided neurosurgery offers the advantage of planning the least traumatic approach before craniotomy due to the knowledge of the exact localisation of the lesion. During a 2-year period 12 patients (age 16-54 years) with intracranial supratentorial cavernomas (size 0.5-1.8 cm) were treated by stereotactically guided microsurgery. The cavernomas were seated in a depth between 0.4 and 4.5 cm. 4 patients had an overt hemorrhage in their history. In six cases a seizure was the first symptom (altogether 8 patients had seizures preoperatively). Two patients were asymptomatic. Standard CRW (Cosman, Roberts, Wells) stereotactic system was used in all cases. The skin incision and the osteoplastic craniotomy (mean diameter 2.8 cm) were planned stereotactically. In 11 patients a transsulcal approach was used. The size of the corticotomy could be limited to less than 1 cm. Using the stereotactic method, all cavernomas were found with a high degree of accuracy. After lesionectomy a total of 1 to 2 mm of the surrounding yellow-stained brain tissue was sucked away because it contains hemosiderin and therefore iron, which may have an epileptogenic effect. No relevant surgical-related neurological morbidity was found in any patient a half year after surgery. Seven out of eight patients were free of seizures.

23290419,Glioblastoma with the appearance of arteriovenous malformation: pitfalls in diagnosis.,"OBJECTIVES: Very few cases of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) associated with gliomas were reported so far in the literature. METHODS: Here, we report a rare case of a glioblastoma with an AVM-like lesion and review the existing literature. RESULTS: We report an unusual case of a 72-year old woman, who presented with a progressive history of aphasia, memory deficit, and headache. Initial MRI imaging was suggestive of a high-grade glioma for which a pterional craniotomy was performed. Intraoperatively, the lesion resembled a vascular malformation. Total extirpation of the lesion was verified by intraoperative MR imaging. Initial histopathological analysis revealed an AVM. Due to the discrepancy between the radiologic and histopathologic findings, the patient was monitored at close intervals. Two month later, multiple lesions were visible on MRI imaging, thus, supporting the diagnosis of malignant glioma. Therefore, after reinvestigating the histopathological sections and cutting the paraffin block in additional serial sections, in only 5% of the section a glioblastoma was discerned which was surrounded by an AVM-like lesion. CONCLUSION: Gliomas are rarely found in association with AVMs and require accurate diagnostic evaluation and interpretation for adequate therapeutic interventions.",2013 May,2013,Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,115,5,501-6,eng,False,S0303-8467(12)00619-1;10.1016/j.clineuro.2012.12.009;S0303-8467(12)00619-1;10.1016/j.clineuro.2012.12.009,Case Reports;Journal Article;Review,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aspartic Acid/analogs & derivatives/metabolism;Brain Chemistry/physiology;Brain Neoplasms/*diagnosis/pathology;Child;Choline/metabolism;Diagnosis, Differential;Female;Glioblastoma/*diagnosis/pathology/surgery;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnosis/pathology/surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy;Male;Middle Aged;Neuronavigation;Neurosurgical Procedures;Tomography, X-Ray Computed",,False,0.05157805488866774,True
2136179,Charged-particle radiosurgery of the brain.,"Charged-particle beams (e.g., protons and helium, carbon and neon ions) manifest unique physical properties which offer advantages for neurosurgery and neuroscience research. The beams have Bragg ionization peaks at depth in tissues, and finite range and are readily collimated to any desired cross-sectional size and shape by metal apertures. Since 1954 nearly 6000 neurosurgical patients worldwide have been treated with stereotactic charged-particle radiosurgery of the brain for various localized and systemic malignant and nonmalignant disorders. Experimental studies with charged-particle beams have been carried out in laboratory animals to characterize anatomic and physiologic correlates of various behavioral and functional properties in the brain. Highly focused charged-particle beams have been used to induce sharply delineated laminar lesions or discrete focal ablation of deep-seated brain structures for the study of the functional anatomy of selected intracranial sites. Charged-particle beam irradiation for stereotactic radiosurgery and radiation oncology of intracranial disorders has achieved increasing importance internationally. More than 30 biomedical accelerator facilities on four continents are currently fully operational, under construction, or in an active planning stage; this last group consists primarily of dedicated biomedical hospital-based facilities. Therapeutic efficacy has been demonstrated clearly for the treatment of selected intracranial sites, e.g., pituitary adenomas and intracranial arteriovenous malformations. Heavier charged particles (e.g., carbon and neon ions) have been found to manifest a number of valuable radiobiologic properties and appear to be of potential advantage in the radiosurgical treatment of those primary or metastatic brain tumors that are radioresistant. The optimal dose and choice of charged-particle species must be determined for the treatment of the different intracranial disorders to improve the cure rate and to minimize potential adverse sequelae of the reaction of the brain to radiation injury.",1990 Oct,1990,Neurosurgery clinics of North America,1,4,955-90,eng,False,,"Journal Article;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.;Review",Animals;Brain Diseases/*surgery;Brain Neoplasms/*surgery;Dogs;Equipment Design;Humans;Hypophysectomy/instrumentation;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Pituitary Neoplasms/*surgery;Radiosurgery/*instrumentation;Stereotaxic Techniques/*instrumentation,,False,0.05769100979884872,True
16466235,Grading and surgical planning for intracranial arteriovenous malformations.,"The treatment of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) has evolved over the last 40 years. These complex vascular lesions remain among the most difficult lesions to treat. Successful treatment of AVMs of the brain includes extensive preoperative planning, multimodality treatment options, and modern postoperative surgical care. The advent of new technologies, including interventional neuroradiology and radiosurgery, has expanded the range of malformations that can be treated effectively and has had a significant impact on those individuals who manifest this disease process. The purpose of this paper is to describe the current grading technique used by the authors and to explore the preoperative treatment and planning that leads to successful surgical obliteration of these lesions. Some description of preoperative interventions, including radiosurgery and interventional procedures will be mentioned; however, only in the context of how they impact on the surgical treatment of these lesions. In other articles in this edition of Neurosurgical Focus interventional procedures and radiosurgery as treatment adjuncts and as primary therapies will be discussed in greater detail.",2001 Nov 15,2001,Neurosurgical focus,11,5,e3,eng,False,110503;10.3171/foc.2001.11.5.4,Journal Article;Review,"Angiography, Digital Subtraction;Cerebral Angiography;Combined Modality Therapy;Embolization, Therapeutic;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/*surgery/therapy;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Microsurgery;Postoperative Care;Preoperative Care;Radiosurgery;Severity of Illness Index;Tomography, X-Ray Computed",,False,0.048972110995070595,True

Histological, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural characteristics of this spindle-shaped cell population in the irradiated AVMs were reminiscent of those described as myofibroblasts in wound healing processes and pathological fibromatoses.

11404701,[Radiosurgery of cerebral arteriovenous malformations: methodology of the dose prescription and its implications for dosimetric results. Retrospective study of 408 cases].,"PURPOSE: To study dosimetric implications of our group dose prescription methodology on a series of 408 cerebral arteriovenous malformations. MATERIAL: and method. Between January 1990 and July 1998, 408 patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations that had never been irradiated before, were treated radiosurgically in a single fraction at Tenon Hospital. 223 patients were treated with a single isocentre and 185 with multiple isocenters. Dosimetric characteristics have been studied as a function of the global quality index of planning, defined our group as the standard deviation of the differential dose volume histogram calculated in the lesion. RESULTS: One percent correlation obtained between some dosimetric data and the global quality index of planning allowed to modelize by linear equations the connection between this quality index and minimum isodose in the lesion, mean doses and isodoses in the underdosed part of the lesion and in the complete lesion. This was done for mono isocentric cases and multi isocentric cases. CONCLUSION: Before the choice of the therapeutic dose and prescription isodose, it is therefore possible from the global quality index of planning to foresee isodoses modelized by the defined equations. So, the radiotherapist can compensate using the prescription since conformity is not perfect and thus attenuate healthy tissues overdosage.",2001 May,2001,Neuro-Chirurgie,47,2-3 Pt 2,239-45,fre,False,75793,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Cohort Studies;Dose Fractionation, Radiation;Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/pathology/*surgery;Models, Theoretical;Paris/epidemiology;Radiation Injuries/etiology/prevention & control;Radiography;Radiosurgery/adverse effects/instrumentation/*methods;Radiotherapy Dosage;Retrospective Studies;Stereotaxic Techniques;Treatment Outcome",,False,0.12598861561549857,True
8875475,Embolization of cerebral arteriovenous malformations: Part II--Aspects of complications and late outcome.,"OBJECTIVE: From 1987 through 1993, we performed embolizations on 150 patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) at Sahlgrenska University Hospital. The patients ranged in age from 5 to 70 years (35.5 +/- 14.8 yr, mean +/- standard deviation) and were selected by neurosurgeons in Scandinavia. We analyzed the risk of complications and late outcome to have a better basis for the decision to perform embolization. METHODS: The follow-up was a personal clinical examination of all surviving patients by a neurologist. Files for all patients were also studied. RESULTS: In 34 patients, the AVMs were eliminated by embolization alone (20 patients) or by supplementary surgery (14 patients). In 66 patients, the AVMs were embolized to a size suitable for supplementary stereotactic radiation. The clinical course was stable for those 100 patients. Another group of 50 patients who had undergone embolization was only partially treated, and as a group, those patients had less favorable outcomes. The manifestations or symptoms leading to diagnosis were in concordance with other studies. Headache and epilepsy showed a positive response to treatment in patients whose AVMs had been eliminated as well as in those who received only partial treatment. A history of cerebral bleeding did not influence the prognosis of recurrent bleeding. Conversely, AVMs with feeder or nidus aneurysms were related to an increased risk of bleeding. If there was a history of bleeding in a patient with large, partially treated AVMs, the prognosis for survival was diminished. CONCLUSION: The indication for treatment increases with the occurrence of AVMs with associated aneurysms. For patients with large AVMs, a history of bleeding justifies a more aggressive approach to treatment. The reduced risk of complications during the last years of the study also increases the indication for embolization.",1996 Sep,1996,Neurosurgery,39,3,460-7; discussion 467-9,eng,False,10.1097/00006123-199609000-00005,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Cause of Death;Child;Child, Preschool;Combined Modality Therapy;*Embolization, Therapeutic;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/mortality/*therapy;Male;Middle Aged;Neurologic Examination;Radiosurgery;Survival Rate;Treatment Outcome",,False,0.19412453870428284,True
22566010,"Comment on: Curative Embolization of Brain Arteriovenous Malformations with Onyx: Patient Selection, Embolization Technique, and Results.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A new curative embolization technique with Onyx for selected small- and medium-sized superficially located brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) was developed, which consists of obliteration of the nidus, including incremental occlusion of the draining veins. We report our first clinical results. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between June 2008 and July 2011, 24 patients (7 women, 17 men; mean age, 41 years; range, 6-74 years) with AVMs were selected for curative embolization with Onyx. Presentation was hemorrhage in 14 and seizures in 10 patients. AVM location was frontal in 11, occipital in six, parietal in four, and temporal in three. AVM size was a mean of 2.2 cm (median 2; range 1-3 cm). RESULTS: Complete angiographic obliteration of the AVM with Onyx in a single session was achieved in all 24 patients. There were no hemorrhagic or ischemic complications (0 %; 95 % CI, 0-16.3 %), and no new deficits induced by the treatment. Of 14 patients with ruptured AVMs, one patient who presented with a large frontal hematoma died shortly after surgical evacuation of the hematoma following complete embolization of a micro-AVM. Follow-up angiography at 3 months in 23 patients demonstrated a small AVM remnant in one that was treated with gamma knife radiosurgery. The other 22 AVMs remained completely occluded.

27153173,Embolization of the choroidal artery in the treatment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVE The anterior and posterior choroidal arteries are often recruited to supply arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) involving important paraventricular structures, such as the basal ganglia, internal capsule, optic radiation, lateral geniculate body, and medial temporal lobe. Endovascular embolization through these arteries is theoretically dangerous because they supply eloquent territories, are of small caliber, and lack collaterals. This study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of embolization through these arteries. METHODS This study retrospectively reviewed 13 patients with cerebral AVMs who underwent endovascular embolization through the choroidal arteries between 2006 and 2014. Embolization was performed as a palliative procedure before open surgery or Gamma Knife radiosurgery. Computed tomography and MRI were performed the day after embolization to assess any surgical complications. The incidence and type of complications and their association with clinical outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS Decreased blood flow was achieved in all patients after embolization. Postoperative CT detected no hemorrhagic complications. In contrast, postoperative MRI detected that 4 of the 13 patients (30.7%) developed infarctions: 3 patients after embolization through the anterior choroidal artery, and 1 patient after embolization through the lateral posterior choroidal artery. Two of the 4 patients in whom embolization was from the cisternal segment of the anterior choroidal artery (proximal to the plexal point) developed symptomatic infarction of the posterior limb of the internal capsule, 1 of whom developed morbidity (7.7%). The treatment-related mortality rate was 0%. Additional treatment was performed in 12 patients: open surgery in 9 and Gamma Knife radiosurgery in 3 patients. Complete obliteration was confirmed by angiography at the last follow-up in 10 patients. Recurrent bleeding from the AVMs did not occur in any of the cases during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS Ischemic complications are possible following the embolization of cerebral AVMs through the choroidal artery, even with modern neurointerventional devices and techniques. Although further study is needed, embolization through the choroidal artery may be an appropriate treatment option when the risk of surgery or radiosurgery is considered to outweigh the risk of embolization.",2017 Apr,2017,Journal of neurosurgery,126,4,1114-1122,eng,False,10.3171/2016.2.JNS152370;10.3171/2016.2.JNS152370,Comment;Journal Article,"*Embolization, Therapeutic;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome",AChA = anterior choroidal artery;AVM = arteriovenous malformation;DWI = diffusion-weighted imaging;GK = Gamma Knife;ICA = internal carotid artery;LPChA = lateral posterior choroidal artery;NBCA = N-butyl cyanoacrylate;PChA = posterior choroidal artery;arteriovenous malformation;choroidal artery;complications;embolization;interventional neurosurgery;vascular disorders,False,0.12966260968575474,True
15035275,Stereotactic radiosurgery for brainstem arteriovenous malformations: factors affecting outcome.,"OBJECT: Management options for arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the brainstem are limited. The long-term results of stereotactic radiosurgery for these disease entities are poorly understood. In this report the authors reviewed both neurological and radiological outcomes following stereotactic radiosurgery for brainstem AVMs over 15 years of experience. METHODS: Fifty patients with brainstem AVMs underwent gamma knife surgery between 1987 and 2002. There were 29 male and 21 female patients with an age range of 7 to 79 years (median 35 years). Anatomical locations of these AVMs included the midbrain (39 lesions), pons (20 lesions), and medulla oblongata (three lesions). The radiation dose applied to the margin of the AVM varied from 12 to 26 Gy (median 20 Gy). Forty-five patients were followed up from 5 to 176 months (mean 72 months). The angiographically confirmed actuarial obliteration rate was 66% at the final follow-up examination. Two patients experienced a hemorrhage before obliteration. The annual hemorrhage rate was 1.7% for the first 3 years after radiosurgery and 0% thereafter. Patients who had received irradiation at two or fewer isocenters had higher obliteration rates (80% compared with 44% for > two isocenters, p = 0.006), and this was related to a more spherical nidus shape. The rate of persistent neurological complications in patients treated using magnetic resonance imaging-based dose planning after 1993 was 7%, compared with 20% in patients treated before 1993. An older patient age, a lesion located in the tectum, and a higher radiosurgery-based score were significantly associated with greater neurological complications. CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic radiosurgery provided complete obliteration of AVMs in two thirds of the patients with a low risk of latency-interval hemorrhage. Better three-dimensional imaging studies and conformal dose planning reduced the risk of adverse radiation effects. Younger patients harboring more spherical AVMs that did not involve the tectal plate had the best outcomes.",2004 Mar,2004,Journal of neurosurgery,100,3,407-13,eng,True,10.3171/jns.2004.100.3.0407,Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Brain Stem/abnormalities/*blood supply/*surgery;Cerebrovascular Circulation/physiology;Child;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/*instrumentation;Treatment Outcome,,True,0.6077879456026951,True
11404692,[Characteristics of epileptic seizures associated with cerebral arteriovenous malformations].,"PURPOSES: The purpose of this study is to analyze the characteristics of epileptic seizures associated with cerebral arteriovenous malformations treated by radiosurgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seven hundred and two patients are studied (406 men, 296 women) with a mean age of 33 when radiosurgery was performed. 210 patients had epileptic seizures; those seizures either uniquely revealed the arteriovenous malformation or were associated with other clinical signs. Seizures occurring after an hemorrhage were excluded from the study. We studied the age category upon seizures occurrence, the malformation localization, type of seizure (partial, generalized, or partial secondary generalized), the history related to the epileptic seizures, the clinical topographical correlation, the number of seizures, their duration prior to the radiosurgery, antiepileptic treatment provided, electroence-phalographic characteristics, angiographic characteristics, prior endovascular or surgical treatment, and factors associated with severe seizure. RESULTS: Epileptic seizures revealed the arteriovenous malformations in 30% of the cases; they predominated between 10 and 40 years (80.5%) with a peak between 20 and 30 years. The malformation localization most frequently associated with seizures were temporal and rolandic for partial seizures, whereas frontal or sylvian localization were predominantly associated with generalized seizures. The type of seizure was, in all cases, related to the malformation localization because of the initial signs seizure. 47.6% of the patients showed a limited number of seizures (between 2 and 20), 27.6% showed only a single seizure, and 24.7% suffered from severe epilepsy. Generalized seizures are unique in the majority of cases (61.8%) whereas partial seizures were severe in 47.6% of the cases. The majority of patients are under a single-drug therapy (79%). The EEG patterns showed a small increase of slow and sharp localized waves in patients presenting seizures compared with the global population (27% and 15% respectively). Severe seizures predominated between 10 and 19 years of age; seizures were exclusively partial in 59.6% of the cases and secondary generalized in 40.4%, their frequencies were between 1 to 4 per month in the majority of cases (59.1%), the delay was often more than 10 years (57.7%), status epilepticus was rare (5.8%), temporal and rolandic localization were predominant, social and professional insertion of the patient was preserved in 87.5% of the cases, and seizures did not provoke any death. The angiographic characteristics associated with seizures were: superficial localization, volume, superficial venous drainage, recruitment and venous divergence.

28495425,Volume-staged stereotactic radiosurgery for large intracranial arteriovenous malformations.,"Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is an effective treatment option for intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVM). However, the treatment of large AVMs (nidus volume ≥12cm(3)) with single-session SRS alone yields generally poor outcomes. Volume-staged SRS (VS-SRS) is a therapeutic strategy for large AVMs which seeks to avoid the disadvantages of single-session SRS, but reports regarding its efficacy remain limited. The aim of this retrospective cohort study is to assess the outcomes of VS-SRS for large AVMs. We identified all AVM patients who underwent VS-SRS at our institution from 2000 to 2015 with ≥12months follow-up. Baseline and outcomes data were analyzed. A total of 12 patients were selected for the study cohort, with a median age of 30years. The median maximum AVM diameter and nidus volume were 4.3cm and 13.6cm(3), respectively. The Spetzler-Martin grade was III and IV each in six AVMs (50%). All patients underwent VS-SRS in two stages, and the median margin dose was 17Gy for both VS-SRS procedures. The median time interval between the two procedures was three months. After a median radiologic follow-up duration of 39months, the median degree of AVM volume reduction (evaluable in nine patients) was 87% (range 12-99%). The rates of radiologically evident, symptomatic, and permanent radiation-induced changes were 58%, 25%, and 8%, respectively. There were no cases of post-SRS hemorrhage.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The paper presents the results of treatment of 17 patients. AVMs were located in the trigonum of the lateral ventricle in 4 cases (23.5%), in the splenium of the corpus callosum and its neighborhood in 4 cases (23.5%), in the parahippocampal and lingual gyrus in 3 cases (17%), in the head of the caudate nucleus in 2 cases (12%), in the hippocampus and the nucleus amygdalae in 2 cases (12%), in the anterior part of the gyrus cinguli in 1 case (6%) and in the truncus of the corpus callosum in 1 case (6%). RESULTS: AVMs most often manifested as intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage (82%). The surgical treatment has been applied (total removal--90%), embolization with histoacryl glue (total embolization--20%) and irradiation with LINAC. The surgical treatment was performed in all patients with hemiparesis and intracerebral hematomas. CONCLUSION: The results of the surgical treatment are good and it fastest prevents recurrent hemorrhage from deep AVM.

32190515,"Assessment of Different Modalities and Their Impact on Patients with Ruptured Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformation Treated in King Abdulaiziz Medical City in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.","Background Intracranial arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a rare congenital disease that is characterized by an abnormal tangle of blood vessels where arteries abnormally shunt into veins with no intervening capillary bed. Several treatment modalities, such as microsurgical removal, embolization, and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), are used to treat AVM either solely or in combination. We aimed to assess and compare the effect, morbidity, and mortality outcomes of mono-treatment with embolization and combined treatment for AVM obliteration. Methodology This retrospective cohort study was conducted in the National Guard Hospital Jeddah and reviewed all the AVM patients that visited the center between 2008 and 2017. We assessed presenting symptoms at diagnosis and any co-morbidities as the clinical characteristics and the patients' AVM and Spetzler-Martin grade as the morphological characteristics. Moreover, we performed a three-year follow-up on suitable patients and assessed their outcomes using the modified Rankin Scale. In addition, we performed follow-up imaging on the patients to evaluate AVM obliteration after any of the procedures. Results We included 29 patients treated in our hospital (72.4%, males; 27.6%, females; mean age 40 years). About 65% of the patients underwent mono-therapy consisting of one or more embolization sessions while about 34% underwent combined treatment (embolization + surgery or embolization + SRS). We found more cases of complete obliteration among patients who underwent mono-therapy (52.6%) than among those who underwent combined treatment (30%). Patients who underwent mono-therapy showed better outcomes compared to those who underwent combined therapy; however, the difference did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions Embolization mono-therapy appears to be more effective with regards to the obliteration rate and outcome compared to combined therapy with either SRS or surgery in patients treated in our center.",2020 Feb 12,2020,Cureus,12,2,e6969,eng,False,10.7759/cureus.6969;e6969;10.7759/cureus.6969,Journal Article,,avm;embolization;intracranial arteriovenous malformations;radiosurgery;vascular malformation,False,0.37112511799613696,True

20670561,The role of intravascular embolization prior to radiosurgery of cerebral arteriovenous malformations. from the standpoint of hemorrhage and early obliteration after gamma knife radiosurgery.,"The role of intravascular embolization prior to radiosurgery of cerebral arteriovenous malformations was evaluated based on the basis of the results of gamma knife radiosurgery in relation to hemorrhage and early obliteration after treatment. Nine of 213 patients experienced hemorrhage 4 to 42 months after radiosurgery. All AVMs in these patients had dilated feeding arteries, and the flow of the AVM was rapid and/or high. An intranidal aneurysm was seen in one patient. Drainage of all AVMs consisted of a single and/or deep draining veins, and venous obstruction was found in six. Sixty-three of 87 patients followed for more than four years after radiosurgery were examined angiographically, and total obliteration of AVM was observed in 52 of them (82.5%). Early obliteration was found in 19 of the 34 patients examined within 12 months. The obliteration rate was significantly higher in slow- and low-flow AVMs (73.9%) than in rapid- and/or high-flow AVMs (18.2%).

37184633,Sporadic multiple cerebral arteriovenous malformations: case report and systematic review of additional 80 cases.,"INTRODUCTION: In absence of hereditary diseases multiple brain arteriovenous malformations are extremely rare. The case series that would include more than 13 patients are unlikely to be found, which causes an obstacle to comprehensively analyzing the peculiarities of epidemiology, symptoms and treatment options for this disorder. We describe patent with two independent arteriovenous malformations in frontal and parietal lobes that have been treated with combination of preoperative embolization, surgical excision and stereotactic radiosurgery. Systematic review of literature was also performed, focusing on epidemiology of sporadic multiple arteriovenous malformations, niduses location, clinical presentation, treatment and outcomes. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We systematically analyzed relevant literature using the PubMed database, encompassing studies in English (published between 1956 and 2023) reporting incidence, epidemiological features, symptomatology and treatment of sporadic multiple brain arteriovenous malformations. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Forty-eight studies with a total of 80 sporadic multiple cerebral arteriovenous malformations were extracted from the literature. Twenty-two papers reported incidence of multiple brain arteriovenous malformations. The average incidence (including our data) was 2.4%, varying significantly between children and adults. Hemorrhage from one AVM was the most frequent debut of multiple cerebral arteriovenous malformations. Surgical removal of niduses remains a valuable treatment option even considering the enhancement of embolization techniques and the development of radiosurgery. CONCLUSIONS: Sporadic multiple cerebral arteriovenous malformations represent a difficult problem to solve. The possibility of persistence of multiple brain arteriovenous malformations should be taken into account when diagnosing and following-up.",2024 Apr,2024,Journal of neurosurgical sciences,68,2,225-231,eng,False,10.23736/S0390-5616.23.06028-9;S0390-5616.23.06028-9;10.23736/S0390-5616.23.06028-9,Case Reports;Journal Article;Systematic Review,"Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery;*Radiosurgery/methods;Embolization, Therapeutic/methods;Adult;Female;Male;Neurosurgical Procedures/methods",,False,0.036458055420333424,True

8971833,Embolization of the nidus of brain arteriovenous malformations with n-butyl cyanoacrylate.,"OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that nidus embolization of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) with Histoacryl (B. Braun, Melsungen, Germany) is effective and yields low morbidity and mortality rates. METHODS: We present a retrospective analysis of 54 brain AVMs treated at the University of Illinois at Chicago from April 1994 to December 1995. Treatment modalities included embolization in all cases and then surgical resection or radiosurgery. INSTRUMENTATION: The nidus was reached with the combined use of a Magic microcatheter (Balt, Montmorency, France) and a Terumo 0.010-inch guidewire. TECHNIQUE: Embolization was performed only when the tip of the microcatheter was wedged into the nidus of the AVMs with no reflux of contrast proximally. The embolization was performed using simultaneous biplane roadmapping with the patient under general anesthesia without Amytal testing. RESULTS: Twenty-six of 54 patients are still waiting for more radical treatment. Two deaths and two minor and one severe permanent neurological deficit occurred. Three patients were cured with embolization alone; 11 patients were cured after surgical resection. Three patients underwent radiosurgery, with one cure after 1 year. CONCLUSION: Nidus embolization with Histoacryl is an effective technique that permits complete cure of a large number of brain AVMs, with or without surgical resection and/or radiosurgery.",1997 Jan,1997,Neurosurgery,40,1,112-20; discussion 120-1,eng,False,,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Cerebral Angiography;Combined Modality Therapy;Craniotomy;Embolization, Therapeutic/*instrumentation;Enbucrilate/*administration & dosage;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/mortality/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Postoperative Complications/diagnostic imaging/mortality;Radiosurgery;Survival Rate;Treatment Outcome",,False,0.21161681376955313,True

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1996 and 2002, 22 children with cerebral AVM were treated at our institution. Mean age at treatment was 11.8 years (range, 4.4-16.4 years). Classification according to Spetzler-Martin was 1 child grade I (4%), 7 grade II (32%), 12 grade III (56%), 1 grade IV (4%), and 1 grade V (4%). Median single dose was 18 Gy/80%-isodose. Median AVM volume was 4.2 mL (range, 0.4-26.5 mL). Median RS-based AVM-score was 1.07 (range, 0.61-3.55). Fifty-nine percent of children experienced intracranial hemorrhage before RS. Median follow-up was 3.1 years (range, 1.7-7.3 years). RESULTS: Actuarial complete obliteration rate (CO) was 54% after 3 years and 65% after 4 years, respectively. Median time interval to CO was 27.1 months. Intracranial hemorrhage after RS was seen in five children after median 13.9 months. Annual bleeding risk was 9.1% after 1 year and 13.6% after 2 years. Maximum diameter>or=3 cm and AVM-volume>or=6 mL were significant predictors for intracranial hemorrhage. Neurologic deficits were improved/completely dissolved in 58% of children and remained stable in 42%. No new onset of neurologic dysfunction was seen after RS. CONCLUSIONS: RS is safe and effective in pediatric cerebral AVM with high obliteration rates. Size and volume of AVM are significant predictors for intracranial bleeding. The same treatment guidelines as in adults should be applied. Careful long-term follow-up observation is required after RS from long life expectation.",2006 Jul 15,2006,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",65,4,1206-11,eng,False,S0360-3016(06)00242-2;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2006.01.041,Evaluation Study;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Intracranial Hemorrhages/etiology;Male;Radiosurgery/adverse effects/*methods;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome",,True,0.696150807498836,False
26145824,Visual Field Preservation in Surgery of Occipital Arteriovenous Malformations: A Prospective Study.,"OBJECTIVE: We reviewed our prospective study of patients with occipital arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) to assess whether the display of optic radiation diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) during neuronavigation-guided surgery can reduce the severity of postoperative visual field deficits (VFDs) and to evaluate the factors associated with visual field preservation. METHODS: Forty-six consecutive patients with occipital AVMs were randomized in our study. DTI of the optic radiation was displayed during neuronavigation surgery in 24 patients. The other 22 patients were treated surgically without neuronavigation. Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores and visual fields were evaluated preoperatively, immediately after surgery, and at the last follow-up. RESULTS: The patients' baseline characteristics and AVM features were statistically similar between the 2 surgical groups. The postoperative obliteration rate was 100%. The postoperative mRS scores did not differ between the 2 groups (P > 0.05). Preexisting VFDs were more common (P = 0.00004) in patients who bled than in those with unruptured AVMs. The application of DTI-incorporated neuronavigation reduced the frequency and severity of postoperative VFDs (P = 0.013 and 0.001, respectively). Visual fields were more likely to be preserved in patients with an AVM >5 mm from the optic radiation (P = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: A history of hemorrhage is an independent risk factor for VFDs associated with occipital AVMs. Although not showing superiority in postoperative mRS, functional MRI navigation-guided surgery may help to radically resect occipital AVMs and preserve patient visual fields. A 5-mm distance from the optic radiation may be a suitable safety margin for visual field preservation.",2015 Nov,2015,World neurosurgery,84,5,1423-36,eng,False,S1878-8750(15)00817-7;10.1016/j.wneu.2015.06.069;S1878-8750(15)00817-7;10.1016/j.wneu.2015.06.069,"Journal Article;Randomized Controlled Trial;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Adolescent;Adult;Child;Diffusion Tensor Imaging;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Intracranial Hemorrhages/complications;Male;Middle Aged;Neuronavigation;Neurosurgical Procedures/adverse effects/*methods;Occipital Lobe/*surgery;Postoperative Complications/*epidemiology/physiopathology/prevention & control;Prognosis;Prospective Studies;Risk Factors;Treatment Outcome;Visual Field Tests;Visual Fields/*physiology;Young Adult,Arteriovenous malformation;Diffusion tensor imaging;Functional MRI;Microsurgery;Neuronavigation;Visual field deficits,False,0.22327043192209828,True
20871448,Gamma knife radiosurgery for dural arteriovenous fistulas.,"BACKGROUND: The current management of intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVFs) incorporates a multimodal approach involving microneurosurgery, endovascular embolization, and radiosurgery. OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of Gamma Knife radiosurgery for dAVFs. METHODS: The series includes patients with dAVFs who had Gamma Knife radiosurgery at the University of Virginia Medical Center between 1989 and 2005 with clinical follow-up through 2008. Medical records were reviewed to obtain clinical history, demographic data, and dosimetry. Radiographic records provided the location and anatomy of the dAVFs. Follow-up angiography was performed 2 to 3 years after treatment, with cure defined as complete obliteration of fistulous flow. Follow-up for clinical symptomology and quality of life was obtained from direct patient and primary physician questionnaires. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients underwent Gamma Knife radiosurgery for dAVFs during the study period. Twenty patients (36%) presented with intracranial hemorrhage before radiosurgery. Gamma Knife radiosurgery was preceded by craniotomy for microneurosurgical ablation in 11 patients (20%) or endovascular embolization in 36 patients (65%). Follow-up angiography was performed on 46 patients (83%) with documented obliteration in 30 patients (65%). Patients lost to follow-up were classified as treatment failures, adjusting the range of efficacy from 65% to 54%. Three patients (5%) suffered a posttreatment hemorrhage during the follow-up period, but no new permanent neurological deficits resulted from these events. CONCLUSION: Gamma Knife radiosurgery is an effective adjunct therapy for dAVFs with persistence of flow after open neurosurgical resection or endovascular treatment while still maintaining a role in nonaggressive dAVFs not amenable to either surgery or embolization.",2010 Nov,2010,Neurosurgery,67,5,1230-5; discussion 1235,eng,False,10.1227/NEU.0b013e3181eff6f7;10.1227/NEU.0b013e3181eff6f7,Journal Article,Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Radiography;Radiosurgery/*methods;Treatment Outcome,,False,0.2114428298288329,True

Clinical features, treatment and results].","OBJECTIVES: We present our experience of 20 cases of arteriovenous malformations (MAV) of the posterior fossa. PATIENTS AND METHODS: During the period 1991 1999 we prospectively collected radiological and therapeutic clinical data and the results obtained in all cases of adults whose arterio venous malformations were treated. We selected 20 of those who had MAV of the posterior fossa. RESULTS: The average age was 39.6 years (15 64). Thirteen (65%) were men. Most patients, 16 cases (80%) presented clinically with cerebellar haemorrhage, subarachnoid and/or intraventricular haemorrhage and 6 (30%) of the patients were admitted in coma. On the Spetzler and Martin scale: grade 1, 1 patient (5%); grade 11, 8 patients (40%); grade 111, 8 patients (40%) and grade 1V, 3 patients (15%). One patient had an associated pedicular aneurysm, another a supratentorial MAV and another patient had several cavernomas. Nine patients required external ventricular drainage, which in 4 cases became a permanent CSF drainage system. Endovascular treatment was used in 8 patients, radiosurgery in 2 and surgery in 9. Complete resection of the MAV was only possible in the patients treated by surgery (two patients had been treated previously by embolizations and radiosurgery). In this series there was a mortality of 20%, in all four cases due to recurrence of bleeding. Good results were obtained in 11 (55%) of the patients, but in the other 5 (25%) there were sequelas.

METHODS: Under the auspices of the International Radiosurgery Research Foundation, this retrospective multicenter study analyzed pediatric patients who underwent repeat, single-session SRS between 1987 and 2022. The primary outcome variable was a favorable outcome, defined as nidus obliteration without hemorrhage or neurological deterioration. Secondary outcomes included rates and probabilities of hemorrhage, radiation-induced changes (RICs), and cyst or tumor formation. RESULTS: The cohort included 83 pediatric patients. The median patient age was 11 years at initial SRS and 15 years at repeat SRS. Fifty-seven children (68.7%) were managed exclusively using SRS, and 42 (50.6%) experienced hemorrhage prior to SRS. Median AVM diameter and volume were substantially different between the first (25 mm and 4.5 cm3, respectively) and second (16.5 mm and 1.6 cm3, respectively) SRS, while prescription dose and isodose line remained similar. At the 5-year follow-up evaluation from the second SRS, nidus obliteration was achieved in 42 patients (50.6%), with favorable outcome in 37 (44.6%). The median time to nidus obliteration and hemorrhage was 35.5 and 38.5 months, respectively. The yearly cumulative probability of favorable outcome increased from 2.5% (95% CI 0.5%-7.8%) at 1 year to 44% (95% CI 32%-55%) at 5 years. The probability of achieving obliteration followed a similar pattern and reached 51% (95% CI 38%-62%) at 5 years. The 5-year risk of hemorrhage during the latency period after the second SRS reached 8% (95% CI 3.2%-16%). Radiographically, 25 children (30.1%) had RICs, but only 5 (6%) were symptomatic. Delayed cyst formation occurred in 7.2% of patients, with a median onset of 47 months. No radiation-induced neoplasia was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The study results showed nidus obliteration in most pediatric patients who underwent repeat SRS for persistent AVMs. The risks of symptomatic RICs and latency period hemorrhage were quite low. These findings suggest that repeat radiosurgery should be considered when treating pediatric patients with residual AVM after prior SRS. Further study is needed to define the role of repeat SRS more fully in this population.",2024 Apr 1,2024,Journal of neurosurgery.

7643971,Multidisciplinary treatment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"A series of 67 patients treated for cerebral AVM with a multidisciplinary approach is reported. The malformations were classified after the Spetzler Grading Scale, with 67% low-grade and 33% high-grade AVMs. Three modes of treatment were used: surgical resection, endovascular embolization, and radiosurgery (linear accelerator technique). The actual treatment was: surgical resection alone (25% of cases), embolization plus resection (25% of cases), embolization alone (21%) and radiosurgery (30%) either alone (12%), or after incomplete embolization (15%) or after incomplete resection (3%). The clinical outcome was evaluated in terms of deterioration due to treatment. The treatment was responsible for a deterioration in 28% of all patients, either minor deterioration (19%) neurological deficit (4%), or death (4%). All complications of surgical resection (17% of all operated cases) and of radiosurgery (10% of irradiated cases) remained minor. None was haemodynamic-related. After endovascular embolization, a deterioration occurred in 25% of all embolized cases (minor 13%, neurological deficit 5% and death 8%). These complications occurring after embolization were haemodynamic related: ischaemia and haemorrhage (50% for each mechanism).

CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 34-year-old woman presented with headaches. Imaging studies demonstrated a 4.5-cm arteriovenous malformation located in the pineal region. She was treated with a two-isocenter plan to a total dose of 1500 cGy prescribed to the 70% isodose line. She was lost to follow-up and presented with a change in mental status, nausea, headaches, and a generalized seizure 9 years later. Magnetic resonance imaging scans demonstrated a large, heterogeneously enhancing mass partially in the treatment volume. INTERVENTION: Surgical debulking demonstrated an infiltrating glial neoplasm consistent with a glioblastoma multiforme.

27911248,International multicenter cohort study of pediatric brain arteriovenous malformations. Part 1: Predictors of hemorrhagic presentation.,"OBJECTIVE Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are the most common cause of spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage in pediatric patients (age < 18 years). Since the cumulative lifetime risk of AVM hemorrhage is considerable in children, an improved understanding of the risk factors influencing hemorrhagic presentation may aid in the management of pediatric AVMs. The aims of this first of a 2-part multicenter, retrospective cohort study are to evaluate the incidence and determine the predictors of hemorrhagic presentation in pediatric AVM patients. METHODS The authors analyzed pooled AVM radiosurgery data from 7 institutions participating in the International Gamma Knife Research Foundation (IGKRF). Patients younger than 18 years at the time of radiosurgery and who had at least 12 months of follow-up were included in the study cohort. Patient and AVM characteristics were compared between unruptured and ruptured pediatric AVMs. RESULTS A total of 357 pediatric patients were eligible for analysis, including 112 patients in the unruptured and 245 patients in the ruptured AVM cohorts (69% incidence of hemorrhagic presentation). The annual hemorrhage rate prior to radiosurgery was 6.3%. Hemorrhagic presentation was significantly more common in deep locations (basal ganglia, thalamus, and brainstem) than in cortical locations (frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes) (76% vs 62%, p = 0.006). Among the factors found to be significantly associated with hemorrhagic presentation in the multivariate logistic regression analysis, deep venous drainage (OR 3.2, p < 0.001) was the strongest independent predictor, followed by female sex (OR 1.7, p = 0.042) and smaller AVM volume (OR 1.1, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Unruptured and ruptured pediatric AVMs have significantly different patient and nidal features. Pediatric AVM patients who possess 1 or more of these high-risk features may be candidates for relatively more aggressive management strategies.",2017 Feb,2017,Journal of neurosurgery.

1598659,[Stereotactic convergent-beam irradiation: its current prospects based on clinical results].,"""Radiosurgery"" is the term for a special concept in radiotherapy. It describes a percutaneous, stereotactically guided irradiation delivering a single high dose with collimated narrow beams. The precise stereotactic localization of the target point and a steep dose gradient outside the target volume allow the administration of high doses to a lesion without damage to adjacent normal tissue. Risk of necrosis, due to a dose volume relationship represents the limits of radiosurgery. Units for radiosurgery were designed at Stockholm using multiple external cobalt-60-gamma sources, at Boston operating with protons of a cyclotron, at Berkeley operating with helium ions accelerated by a synchrocyclotron. An attractive alternative to these complicated and expensive facilities is the use of a modified linear accelerator. At the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg such a system was developed and has been available for the treatment of patients since 1984. Though, data of over 100,000 patients with vascular malformations and cancer disease are available worldwide, the indication for this therapy is validated only for a minority of entities. In cases of inoperable arteriovenous malformations favourable results in achieving obliteration range between 60% and 100% were obtained. Median survival for solitary brain metastases with controlled, extracerebral tumor diseases were between nine and twelve months. Up to now, advantages of stereotactic irradiation for benign tumor masses could not be proven. Therefore, randomized trials should be initiated in this field, considering decisive improvements in local tumor control with techniques of microsurgery and fractionated, postoperative radiotherapy during the last few years.",1992 May,1992,Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ...

17621031,An arteriovenous malformation model for stereotactic radiosurgery research.,"OBJECTIVE: To introduce the utilization of a swine arteriovenous malformation (AVM) model for stereotactic radiosurgery research and to describe the morphological changes in the vessels after radiation. METHODS: The model was created in six animals by creation of a right-sided carotid-jugular fistula. Pre- and postsurgical hemodynamic evaluation was performed. The left rete was radiated in four animals; two animals were not radiated. All animals were sacrificed 4 months after surgery, and the bilateral retia were obtained at autopsy. RESULTS: There were no procedure-related complications. A pressure gradient of 20 mmHg across the nidus was obtained after surgery. The peak velocity in the arterial feeder increased from 18.5 to 83 cm/s. Microscopic examination of the control animals showed intimal hyperplasia and disrupted internal elastic lamina, similar to human AVMs. The radiated retia showed more prominent intimal hyperplasia. This was confirmed by histometric studies showing greater luminal occlusion in radiated specimens. Adventitial fibrosis was prominent in the radiated retia and was absent in the control animals. Immunohistochemical studies showed proliferating smooth muscle cells in the intima. The adventitial fibrosis consisted of smooth muscle cells surrounded by collagen Type IV extracellular matrix. CONCLUSION: The nidus component and high-flow vasculopathy make this an attractive model for stereotactic radiosurgery research. Histology of the radiated models is similar to those described in radiated human AVMs. Further studies of the model are warranted to gain a better understanding of the cellular and molecular events in AVM vessels after stereotactic radiosurgery.",2007 Jul,2007,Neurosurgery,61,1,152-9; discussion 159,eng,False,00006123-200707000-00018;10.1227/01.neu.0000279736.07683.1e,"Evaluation Study;Journal Article;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural","Animals;Biomedical Research/*methods;*Disease Models, Animal;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Male;Radiography;Radiosurgery/*methods;Swine",,False,0.08831274915712345,True
1572817,Radiosurgery and brain tolerance: an analysis of neurodiagnostic imaging changes after gamma knife radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations.,"In order to analyze complications and the factors responsible for the development of serial imaging changes after stereotactic radiosurgery for intracranial arteriovenous malformations, we reviewed serial post-treatment magnetic resonance imaging scans in 72 patients. Median follow-up was 23 months (range 12 to 35 months). Twenty patients developed post-radiosurgical imaging changes consisting of new regions of increased T2 signal on magnetic resonance imaging in brain surrounding the arteriovenous malformation (two year actuarial incidence of 31%). Imaging changes were associated with headache or new neurological deficits in nine of these 20 (45%) and remained asymptomatic in 11 (55%). Symptoms developed in three of 13 patients with imaging changes in the cerebral cortex or cerebellum, in contrast to six of seven patients who had symptoms with imaging changes in the brainstem (p = .028). The onset of imaging changes varied from five to 18 months after radiosurgery (median, 12 months). Serial follow-up scans four to 25 months after the onset of imaging changes were available for review in 16 patients. Post-radiosurgical imaging changes completely resolved within 4 to 19 months in ten patients and have not yet completely resolved after 6 to 25 months in six patients. The projected actuarial rate for resolution of imaging changes was 88%, 19 months after onset; the median time for resolution was 14 months. Univariate analysis revealed that the development of imaging changes was significantly associated with treatment volume (p = .025), the risk predicted from the integrated logistic formula (p = .042), and the number of isocenters treated (p = .042).

39094935,Microsurgery of Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformations in a Resource-Limited Setting: The First Case-Series from Iraq.,"BACKGROUND: Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) can lead to significant morbidity and are particularly challenging to manage in resource-limited settings where endovascular treatment modalities are unaffordable for most patients. OBJECTIVE: To describe the first case series of AVM from Iraq with an analysis of the related clinicoradiologic characteristics, operative features, and outcomes. METHODS: A single-center database from October 2018 to December 2022 was reviewed to analyze the characteristics of cerebral AVMs who underwent surgical treatment in Baghdad, Iraq. We collected patient demographics, clinical, radiologic, operative, and the follow-up combined outcome results (modified Rankin Scale score and the presence of AVM remnants). RESULTS: Of the 54 AVM patients treated with microsurgery, the majority of lesions have Spetzler-Martin grade of 3 (31.5%), followed by grade 1 (29.6%). The parietal lobe was the most common location of AVM in 25.9% of the cases, and the temporal location had better outcomes. The mean duration of surgery was 8.5 hours, ranging from 3 to 14 hours, with 20.3% of cases having undergone preoperative stereotactic radiosurgery, and just one patient received preoperative embolization. Good combined outcome (modified Rankin Scale 0-2 and no AVM remnant) was associated with lower SM grades (P=0.003); location in the nondominant hemisphere (P=0.036), and noneloquent regions (P=0.006); absence of deep venous drainage (P=0.042) and no intraoperative brain swelling (P=0.004).

23205800,Long-term follow-up results of intentional 2-stage Gamma Knife surgery with an interval of at least 3 years for arteriovenous malformations larger than 10 cm³.,"OBJECT: Little information is available on staged Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) with an interval of 3 years or more when used to treat arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) with volumes larger than 10 cm(3). The goal of this study was to increase knowledge in this area by reporting the authors' experience. METHODS: The authors describe an institutional review board-approved retrospective study in which they examined databases including information on 250 patients who consecutively underwent GKS for cerebral AVMs during a 16-year period (1988-2004). Among the 250 patients the authors identified 31 patients (12.4%, 15 female and 16 male patients with a mean age of 29 years [range 10-63 years]) in whom 2-stage GKS was intentionally planned at the time of initial treatment because the volume of the AVM nidus was larger than 10 cm(3). The most common presentation was bleeding (14 patients), followed by seizures (9 patients), incidental findings (7 patients), and headache with scintillation (1 patient). One patient underwent GKS for the treatment of 2 AVMs simultaneously, and thus 32 AVMs are included in this study. The mean nidus volume was 16.2 cm(3) (maximum 55.8 cm(3)). In all 31 patients, relatively low radiation doses (12-16 Gy directed at the periphery of the lesion) were intentionally used for the first GKS. The second GKS was scheduled for at least 36 months after the first. RESULTS: Complete nidus obliteration was obtained after the first GKS in 1 patient. To date, 26 patients have undergone a second procedure with a post-GKS mean interval of 41 months (range 24-83 months); 2 other patients refused to undergo the second GKS, and no further treatment was given because of severe morbidity in 1 case and death due to bleeding in the other case. Among the 26 patients who did undergo a second procedure, 3 patients refused follow-up digital subtraction (DS) angiography, another is scheduled for follow-up DS angiography, and 2 patients died, one of bleeding and the other of an unknown cause. The remaining 20 patients underwent follow-up DS angiography. Complete nidus obliteration was confirmed in 13 patients (65.0%) and remarkable nidus shrinkage in the other 7 patients (35.0%). In 2 of these 7 patients, a third GKS achieved complete nidus obliteration. Therefore, the cumulative complete obliteration rate in this series was 76.2% (16 of 21 eligible patients). Seven patients (22.6%) experienced bleeding. The bleeding rates were 9.7%, 16.1%, 16.1%, and 26.1%, respectively, at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years post-GKS. There were 2 deaths and 3 cases of morbidity (persistent coma, mild hemimotor weakness, and hemianopsia in 1 patient each). Hemorrhage did not produce neurological deficits in the other 2 patients. During the mean post-GKS follow-up period of 105 months (range 42-229 months) to date, mild symptomatic GKS-related complications occurred in 2 patients (6.5%); these were classified as Radiation Oncology Group Neurotoxicity Grade 1 in 1 patient and Grade 2 in the other. Among various pre-GKS clinical factors, univariate analysis showed only patient age to impact complications (hazard ratio 0.675, 95% CI 0.306-0.942, p = 0.0085). The rate of complications in the pediatric cases was 33.3%, whereas that in the adolescent and adult cases was 0% (p = 0.0323).

32822953,Clinico-Radiologic Outcomes After Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Patients with Complex High-Risk Multiple Arteriovenous Malformations.,"OBJECTIVE: The present study aims to define the outcome and risks of patients with multiple arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) treated by stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the records of 1232 patients with AVMs who underwent SRS at our center between 1987 and 2017. We identified 10 patients who had SRS for multiple AVMs (total of 25). Eight patients presented with intracranial hemorrhage before SRS. Four patients had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. A Spetzler-Martin grade I AVM was diagnosed in 11 AVMs, grade II in 7, grade III in 6, and grade IV in 1 AVM. The median maximum diameter was 12 mm, the median target volume was 1.1 cm(3), and the median margin dose was 20 Gy. Twenty-four AVMs were treated with single-session SRS, and 1 AVM was treated with volume-staged SRS. RESULTS: The angiographic complete obliteration rate of each AVM was 18.2%, 58.0%, and 66.4% at 3, 5, and 7 years, respectively. The angiographic complete obliteration rate of all treated AVMs in each patient was 11.1%, 51.4%, and 51.4% at 3, 5, and 7 years, respectively. In multivariate analysis, higher marginal dose (≥18 Gy, P = 0.031) was significantly associated with complete obliteration of AVMs. After obliteration of all their AVMs was confirmed no patient bled. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with complex multiple AVMs often presented with a brain hemorrhage.

In the time period covered in this study, 72 patients attained angiographically confirmed cures after radiosurgery and 36 were retreated after the initial radiosurgical treatment failed. METHODS: Using a computerized image fusion technique, the initial radiosurgical dosimetry plan was superimposed on the remaining AVM nidus at the time of retreatment. Twenty-six percent of the retreated cases were found to have AVM niduses outside the original treatment isodose line, which means that targeting error was a factor. The retreated group was also statistically compared with the cured group.

The 44 year-old female patient was presented with headache and vomiting. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed intraventricular hemorrhage.

24605839,Radiosurgery for low-grade intracranial arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECT: Low-grade, or Spetzler-Martin (SM) Grades I and II, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are associated with lower surgical morbidity rates than higher-grade lesions. While radiosurgery is now widely accepted as an effective treatment approach for AVMs, the risks and benefits of the procedure for low-grade AVMs, as compared with microsurgery, remain poorly understood. The authors of this study present the outcomes for a large cohort of low-grade AVMs treated with radiosurgery. METHODS: From an institutional radiosurgery database comprising approximately 1450 AVM cases, all patients with SM Grade I and II lesions were identified. Patients with less than 2 years of radiological follow-up, except those with complete AVM obliteration, were excluded from analysis. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional-hazards and logistic regression analyses were used to determine factors associated with obliteration, radiation-induced changes (RICs), and hemorrhage following radiosurgery. RESULTS: Five hundred two patients harboring low-grade AVMs were eligible for analysis. The median age was 35 years, 50% of patients were male, and the most common presentation was hemorrhage (47%). The median AVM volume and prescription dose were 2.4 cm(3) and 23 Gy, respectively. The median radiological and clinical follow-up intervals were 48 and 62 months, respectively. The cumulative obliteration rate was 76%. The median time to obliteration was 40 months, and the actuarial obliteration rates were 66% and 80% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. Independent predictors of obliteration were no preradiosurgery embolization (p < 0.001), decreased AVM volume (p = 0.005), single draining vein (p = 0.013), lower radiosurgery-based AVM scale score (p = 0.016), and lower Virginia Radiosurgery AVM Scale (Virginia RAS) score (p = 0.001). The annual postradiosurgery hemorrhage rate was 1.4% with increased AVM volume (p = 0.034) and lower prescription dose (p = 0.006) as independent predictors. Symptomatic and permanent RICs were observed in 8.2% and 1.4% of patients, respectively. No preradiosurgery hemorrhage (p = 0.011), a decreased prescription dose (p = 0.038), and a higher Virginia RAS score (p = 0.001) were independently associated with postradiosurgery RICs. CONCLUSIONS: Spetzler-Martin Grade I and II AVMs are very amenable to successful treatment with stereotactic radiosurgery. While patient, physician, and institutional preferences frequently dictate the final course of treatment, radiosurgery offers a favorable risk-to-benefit profile for the management of low-grade AVMs.",2014 Aug,2014,Journal of neurosurgery,121,2,457-67,eng,True,10.3171/2014.1.JNS131713;10.3171/2014.1.JNS131713,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Child;Embolization, Therapeutic/adverse effects/methods;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/pathology/*surgery;Kaplan-Meier Estimate;Male;Middle Aged;Neurosurgical Procedures/adverse effects/*methods;Postoperative Hemorrhage/epidemiology;Radiosurgery/adverse effects/*methods;Reoperation/statistics & numerical data;Retrospective Studies;Risk Assessment;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",AVM = arteriovenous malformation;DSA = digital subtraction angiography;Gamma Knife;RBAS = radiosurgery-based AVM scale;RIC = radiation-induced change;SM = Spetzler-Martin;Virginia RAS = Virginia Radiosurgery AVM Scale;intracranial arteriovenous malformation;low Spetzler-Martin grade;stereotactic radiosurgery;stroke;vascular disorders;vascular malformation,True,0.923294009253291,True
15794825,Operation of arteriovenous malformations assisted by stereoscopic navigation-controlled display of preoperative magnetic resonance angiography and intraoperative ultrasound angiography.,"OBJECTIVE: To study the application of navigated stereoscopic display of preoperative three-dimensional (3-D) magnetic resonance angiography and intraoperative 3-D ultrasound angiography in a clinical setting. METHODS: Preoperative magnetic resonance angiography and intraoperative ultrasound angiography are presented as stereoscopic images on the monitor during the operation by a simple red/blue technique. Two projections are generated, one for each eye, according to a simple ray casting method. Because of integration with a navigation system, it is possible to identify vessels with a pointer. The system has been applied during operations on nine patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Seven of the patients had AVMs in an eloquent area. RESULTS: The technology makes it easier to understand the vascular architecture during the operation, and it offers a possibility to identify and clip AVM feeders both on the surface and deep in the tissue at the beginning of the operation. All 28 feeders identified on the preoperative angiograms were identified by intraoperative navigated stereoscopy. Twenty-five were clipped at the beginning of the operation. The other three were clipped at a later phase of the operation. 3-D ultrasound angiography was useful to map the size of the nidus, to detect the degree of brain shift, and to identify residual AVM. CONCLUSION: Stereoscopic visualization enhances the surgeon's perception of the vascular architecture, and integrated with navigation technology, this offers a reliable system for identification and clipping of AVM feeders in the initial phase of the operation.",2005 Apr,2005,Neurosurgery,56,2 Suppl,281-90; discussion 281-90,eng,False,10.1227/01.neu.0000157005.51053.41,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adult;Equipment Design;Female;Humans;*Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/*surgery;*Magnetic Resonance Angiography;Male;Middle Aged;*Monitoring, Intraoperative/methods;Neuronavigation;*Neurosurgical Procedures;Retrospective Studies;*Surgery, Computer-Assisted/instrumentation;Treatment Outcome;*Ultrasonography",,False,0.04258808873666431,True
19835467,Treatment of brain arteriovenous malformations with high-flow arteriovenous fistulas: risk and complications associated with endovascular embolization in multimodality treatment. Clinical article.,"OBJECT: High-flow fistulas associated with brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) pose a significant challenge to both stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and surgical treatment. The purpose of this study was to examine the outcomes of multimodality treatment of AVMs in association with a large arteriovenous fistula (AVF), with a special focus on endovascular embolization and its associated complications. METHODS: One hundred ninety-two patients harboring cerebral AVMs underwent endovascular treatment in the authors' department between 1997 and 2003. Of these, the authors selected 74 patients presenting with an AVM associated with high-flow AVF(s) for a retrospective analysis based on the findings of superselective angiography. After endovascular embolization, 32 patients underwent resection, 33 underwent either SRS or hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT), and 3 underwent both surgery and SRS. Six patients underwent embolization only. Immediate and midterm treatment outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Fifty-seven (77%) of the 74 patients had AVMs that were Spetzler-Martin Grade III or higher. A complete resection was achieved in all 32 patients. Of patients who underwent SRS/HSRT, 13 patients (39.3%) had either complete or > 90% obliteration of the AVM, and 2 patients (6.1%) had incomplete obliteration. Fourteen patients (42.4%) with residual AVM underwent repeated radiotherapy (and remain under observation). Of the 3 patients who underwent both SRS and resection, resection was complete in 2 and incomplete in one. No follow-up was obtained in 6 patients (8.1%). An endovascular complication was observed in 4 patients (5.4%). Fistula embolization was safely performed in every patient, whereas every endovascular complication was associated with other procedures such as nidus embolization. CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular occlusion of the fistulous component was successfully achieved in every patient; every endovascular complication in this series was related to other procedures such as nidus embolization. The importance of the fistula treatment should be emphasized to minimize the endovascular complications and to maximize the treatment effect when a multimodality therapy is used to treat brain AVMs with large AVF.",2010 Oct,2010,Journal of neurosurgery,113,4,715-22,eng,False,10.3171/2009.9.JNS081588;10.3171/2009.9.JNS081588,Journal Article,"Angiography, Digital Subtraction;Arteriovenous Fistula/radiotherapy/*surgery/*therapy;Cerebral Angiography;Combined Modality Therapy/adverse effects/*methods/mortality;Embolization, Therapeutic/adverse effects/*methods/mortality;Female;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/radiotherapy/*surgery/*therapy;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Neurosurgical Procedures;Radiosurgery/adverse effects/*methods/mortality;Risk;Tomography, X-Ray Computed;Treatment Outcome",,False,0.2958189559355649,True
1607950,Clinical outcome of radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"The clinical outcomes are described for 247 consecutive cases of arteriovenous malformation (AVM) treated with the gamma knife between April, 1970, and December 31, 1983. Headache resolved in 65 (66.3%) of the 98 patients presenting with this symptom and improved in an additional nine (9.2%). Of 59 patients admitted with seizures, 11 (18.6%) became seizure-free without anticonvulsant medication and an additional 30 patients (50.8%) became seizure-free with anticonvulsant medication. Pre-existing neurological deficits improved or totally disappeared following radiosurgery in 56.7% of affected cases. This improvement presumably occurred within the frame of the natural history. The protective effect of the ionizing beams against hemorrhage in incompletely obliterated AVM's is analyzed. To assess the rate of rebleeding, probability estimates were calculated using both the person-year method and the Kaplan-Meier life table. With the person-year method the actual rebleed rate is not too different from the values observed in the natural history of the disease (2% to 3%/yr). Analysis by Kaplan-Meier life-table estimates demonstrated a risk of nearly 3.7%/yr until 60 months after radiosurgery. Five years following treatment, the life table ends in a plateau which could be interpreted as an indication of decrease in the risk of hemorrhage. However, long flat regions at the right end of the life table do not imply that the real risk of rebleeding is negligible unless a large number of patients have been followed well into or beyond the flat region.",1992 Jul,1992,Journal of neurosurgery,77,1,1-8,eng,False,10.3171/jns.1992.77.1.0001,Journal Article,Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology/*prevention & control;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/physiopathology/*surgery;Life Tables;Male;*Radiosurgery;Treatment Outcome,,False,0.33912818721742216,True
19123888,Treatment of arteriovenous malformations using Gamma Knife surgery: the experience at the University of Washington from 2000 to 2005.,"OBJECT: The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy and toxicity of treating arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) with the model 3C Gamma Knife at the University of Washington Medical Center. METHODS: Ninety-five evaluable patients with 99 treatable AVMs were treated at the University of Washington Medical Center from April 2000 through June 2005. The median patient age at the time of treatment was 40 years (range 6-68 years). The male to female patient ratio was 0.98:1. The median AVM volume treated was 3.8 cm(3) (range 0.12-32 cm(3)). Forty-four percent of the patients had hemorrhaged prior to treatment. The median peripheral Gamma Knife surgery dose was 20 Gy with a median of 12 isocenters treated. The median follow-up duration was 38 months (range 3-91 months). Eighty-one percent of the patients had no previous stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), whereas the remaining 19% had previously been treated with linear accelerator-based SRS. RESULTS: The Kaplan-Meier estimated 6-year AVM obliteration rate for the entire cohort was 71.4%. The Kaplan-Meier estimated 6-year obliteration rate was 72% for patients having no prior SRS and 54.5% for those undergoing repeat SRS. The median time to AVM obliteration was 47 months, with 90% of the obliterations occurring between 24 and 58 months. Eight patients (7.4%) experienced late toxicities. There were 2 fatal bleeds and 13 (13.8%) nonfatal bleeds after Gamma Knife surgery.

15662777,Long-term complications after gamma knife surgery for arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECT: The authors analyzed of the long-term complications that occur 2 or more years after gamma knife surgery (GKS) for intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). METHODS: Patients with previously untreated intracranial AVMs that were managed by GKS and followed for at least 2 years after treatment were selected for analysis (237 cases). Complete AVM obliteration was attained in 130 cases (54.9%), and incomplete obliteration in 107 cases (45.1%). Long-term complications were observed in 22 patients (9.3%). These complications included hemorrhage (eight cases), delayed cyst formation (eight cases), increase of seizure frequency (four cases), and middle cerebral artery stenosis and increased white matter signal intensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (one case of each). The long-term complications were associated with larger nidus volume (p < 0.001) and a lobar location of the AVM (p < 0.01). Delayed hemorrhage was associated only with incomplete obliteration of the nidus (p < 0.05). Partial obliteration conveyed no benefit. Delayed cyst formation was associated with a higher maximal GKS dose (p < 0.001), larger nidus volume (p < 0.001), complete nidus obliteration (p < 0.01), and a lobar location of the AVM (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Incomplete obliteration of the nidus is the most important factor associated with delayed hemorrhagic complications. Partial obliteration does not seem to reduce the risk of hemorrhage. Complete obliteration can be complicated by delayed cyst formation, especially if high maximal treatment doses have been administered.",2005 Jan,2005,Journal of neurosurgery,102 Suppl,,34-7,eng,True,10.3171/jns.2005.102.s_supplement.0034,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Brain/blood supply/diagnostic imaging/pathology/surgery;Cerebral Angiography;Cerebral Hemorrhage/*etiology;Child;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/pathology/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;*Postoperative Complications;Radiation Dosage;Radiosurgery/*instrumentation;Time;Tomography, X-Ray Computed",,False,0.3800724992598395,False
25175434,Stereotactic radiosurgery of intracranial arteriovenous malformations and the use of the K index in determining treatment dose.,"OBJECT: The appropriate dose during stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) remains a matter of debate. In the present study, the authors retrospectively evaluated the association of using a prescribed dose calculated utilizing the K index with the obliteration rate of cerebral AVMs after SRS. METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective analysis of the Cleveland Clinic SRS database. All patients undergoing Gamma Knife radiosurgery for cerebral AVMs from 1997 to 2010 were selected. Regression techniques and Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to investigate the effect of divergence from the optimal K index dose on the rate of AVM obliteration. RESULTS: In the study period 152 patients (mean age 43.6 years; 53.9% of treatments were performed in females) underwent 165 Gamma Knife radiosurgery treatments for AVMs. In a univariate analysis Spetzler-Martin grade (OR 0.63 [95% CI 0.42-0.93]), higher AVM score (OR 0.43 [95% CI 0.27-0.70]), larger AVM volume (OR 0.88 [95% CI 0.82-0.94]), and higher maximum diameter (OR 0.56 [95% CI 0.41-0.77]) were associated with a lower rate of AVM obliteration. Higher margin dose (OR 1.16 [95% CI 1.08-1.24]) and higher maximum dose (OR 1.08 [95% CI 1.04-1.13]) were associated with a higher obliteration rate. To further examine the effect of prescribed dose divergence from the calculated K index dose, cases were classified to groups depending on the AVM volume and dose variance from the ideal K index dose. Contingency tables and Kaplan-Meier curves were then created, and no significant differences in rates of obliteration were noted among the different groups. CONCLUSIONS: Gamma Knife radiosurgery for cerebral AVMs remains an effective and safe treatment modality. Smaller AVMs may receive doses less than the calculated K index dose without an apparent effect on obliteration rates.",2014 Sep,2014,Neurosurgical focus,37,3,E15,eng,True,10.3171/2014.7.FOCUS14157;10.3171/2014.7.FOCUS14157,Journal Article,"Adult;Analysis of Variance;Cerebral Angiography;Cohort Studies;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/mortality/*surgery;Kaplan-Meier Estimate;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;*Outcome Assessment, Health Care;Radiosurgery/*methods;Regression Analysis;Time Factors;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",AVM = arteriovenous malformation;GKRS = Gamma Knife radiosurgery;K index;SRS = stereotactic radiosurgery;arteriovenous malformation;stereotactic radiosurgery,True,0.8359366396278868,True
39016379,Long-term complications and outcomes of therapeutic embolization of cerebral arteriovenous malformations: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Embolization is a promising treatment strategy for cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). However, consensus regarding the main complications or long-term outcomes of embolization in AVMs remains lacking. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the most prevalent complications and long-term outcomes in patients with AVM undergoing therapeutic embolization. DESIGN AND SETTING: This systematic review was conducted at the Federal University of Alagoas, Arapiraca, Brazil. METHODS: This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses criteria. Data were obtained from MEDLINE, PubMed, LILACS, and SciELO databases, which included the epidemiological profile of the population, characteristics of the proposed therapy, complications (hemorrhagic events and neurological deficits), and long-term outcomes (modified Rankin scale pre- and post-treatment, AVM recanalization, complete obliteration, and deaths). RESULTS: Overall, the analysis included 34 articles (2,799 patients). Grade III Spetzler-Martin AVMs were observed in 34.2% of cases. Notably, 39.3% of patients underwent embolization combined with radiosurgery. The most frequently reported long-term complication was hemorrhage, which occurred in 8.7% of patients at a mean follow-up period of 58.6 months. Further, 6.3% of patients exhibited neurological deficits after an average of 34.7 months. Complete obliteration was achieved in 51.4% of the cases after a mean period of 36 months. Recanalization of AVMs was observed in 3.5% of patients. Long-term death occurred in 4.0% of patients. CONCLUSION: Embolization of AVMs is an increasingly safe strategy with low long-term complications and satisfactory outcomes, especially in patients who have undergone combination therapies.

30980204,What is the best therapeutic approach to a pediatric patient with a deep-seated brain AVM?,"Although brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) account for a very small proportion of cerebral pathologies in the pediatric population, they are the cause of roughly 50% of spontaneous intracranial hemorrhages. Pediatric bAVMs tend to rupture more frequently and seem to have higher recurrence rates than bAVMs in adults. Thus, the management of pediatric bAVMs is particularly challenging. In general, the treatment options are conservative treatment, microsurgery, endovascular therapy (EVT), gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS), proton-beam stereotactic radiosurgery (PSRS), or a combination of the above. In order to identify the best approach to deep-seated pediatric bAVMs, we performed a systematic review, according to the PRISMA guidelines. None of the options seem to offer a clear advantage over the others when used alone. Microsurgery provides the highest obliteration rate, but has higher incidence of neurological complications. EVT may play a role when used as adjuvant therapy, but as a stand-alone therapy, the efficacy is low and the long-term side effects of radiation from the multiple sessions required in deep-seated pediatric bAVMs are still unknown. GKRS has a low risk of complication, but the obliteration rates still leave much to be desired. Finally, PSRS offers promising results with a more accurate radiation that avoids the surrounding tissue, but data is limited due to its recent introduction. Overall, a multi-modal approach, or even an active surveillance, might be the most suitable when facing deep-seated bAVM, considering the difficulty of their management and the high risk of complications in the pediatric population.",2019 Jun,2019,Neurosurgical review,42,2,409-416,eng,False,10.1007/s10143-019-01101-8;10.1007/s10143-019-01101-8;10.1007/s10143-019-01101-8,Journal Article;Systematic Review,Brain/surgery;Child;Combined Modality Therapy;Conservative Treatment;Endovascular Procedures;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/*therapy;Intracranial Hemorrhages/etiology;Microsurgery;Proton Therapy;Radiosurgery,Deep-seated arteriovenous malformations;Endovascular treatment;Gamma knife radiation surgery;Microsurgery;Proton beam stereotactic radiosurgery;Review,False,0.0907040531776192,True

We investigated the clinical applicability of two-dimensional thick-slice, contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance digital subtraction angiography (2D MRDSA) with high temporal resolution in the assessment of AVMs. We performed 78 2D MRDSA studies of treated or untreated small to medium-size AVMs on a 1.5 tesla imager. Two observers independently evaluated demonstration of nidus flow void on T2-weighted images and each component of the AVM on 2D MRDSA employing a three-point grading scale. In 55 patients with AVMs, the mean ratings of nidus flow voids, feeding vessels, nidi, draining vessels and early venous filling on MRI were 2.8, 2.4, 2.6, 2.8 and 2.8, respectively. sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for an AVM using 2D MRDSA were 87, 100, 100 and 78%, respectively and for nidus flow voids on T2-weighted images 80, 91, 96 and 66%, respectively. 2D MRDSA can thus demonstrate haemodynamic features of AVMs. It can be employed as a less invasive, dynamic angiographic tool for follow-up of AVMs previously delineated by catheter angiography.",2003 Jan,2003,Neuroradiology,45,1,27-33,eng,False,10.1007/s00234-002-0844-5,Journal Article,"Adult;Angiography, Digital Subtraction;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnosis/surgery;Magnetic Resonance Angiography/*methods;Male;Predictive Value of Tests;Radiosurgery;Sensitivity and Specificity",,False,0.12812983929000016,True
37026340,SRS for Cavernous Malformations: Myths and Realities.,"The optimal management of cavernous malformations (CMs) remains controversial. Over the past decade, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has gained wider acceptance in the management of CMs, especially in those with deep location, eloquence, and where surgery is of high risk. Unlike arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), there is no imaging surrogate endpoint to confirm CM obliteration. Clinical response to SRS can only be gauged by a reduction in long-term CM hemorrhage rates. There is concern that the long-term benefits of SRS and the reduced rehemorrhage rate after a latency period of 2 years may only be a reflection of natural history. Of further concern is the development of adverse radiation effects (AREs), which were significant in the early experimental studies. The lessons learnt from that era have led to the progressive development of well-defined, lower marginal dose treatment protocols that have reported less toxicity (5%-7%) and consequently reduced morbidity. Currently, there is at least Class II, Level B evidence for use of SRS in solitary CMs with previous symptomatic hemorrhage in eloquent areas with high surgical risk. Recent prospective cohort studies observing untreated brainstem and thalamic CMs report significantly higher hemorrhage rates and neurological sequelae than the rates reported from contemporary pooled large natural history meta-analyses. Furthermore, this strengthens our recommendation for early proactive SRS in symptomatic deep-seated CMs due to the higher morbidity associated with observation and microsurgery. The key to successful outcomes for any surgical intervention is patient selection. We hope that our precis on contemporary SRS techniques in the management of CMs will assist this process.",2023 Mar-Apr,2023,Neurology India,71,Supplement,S100-S108,eng,False,10.4103/0028-3886.373639;ni_2023_71_7_100_373639;10.4103/0028-3886.373639,Journal Article,Humans;Treatment Outcome;Follow-Up Studies;*Radiosurgery/methods;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery;Brain Stem/surgery;Retrospective Studies,Cavernous Malformation;hemorrhage;seizure;stereotactic radiosurgery,False,0.28294086382530365,True
12419439,Intra-arterial CT-angiography for cerebral arteriovenous malformation--initial experiences for treatment planning of radiosurgery.,"PURPOSE: To clarify the feasibility and effectiveness of intra-arterial CT angiography (IACTA) for treatment planning of arteriovenous malformation radiosurgery. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A CT scanner installed in an angiographic examination room was used. Helical IACTA was performed in 22 patients during continuous intra-arterial infusion of contrast medium via the internal carotid or vertebral artery, and dynamic IACTA was performed in 20 of these patients with reconstruction at 0.2-s intervals. The dynamic IACTA was repeated for each 3- or 5-mm increment to encompass the nidus. Subtractions were performed in postembolization cases. A retrospective review of IACTA was performed to assess the effectiveness of dynamic scans. RESULTS: No complications related to the angiographic procedure or CT imaging were detected. High contrast enhancement was obtained for both helical and dynamic IACTA. In 18 of the 20 cases (90%), draining veins were separated from the nidus by using the enhancement patterns, and in 13 cases (65%), feeding arteries were separated. CONCLUSION: Dynamic IACTA added important information for target-volume determinations. Conventional CT and MRI could be omitted from the protocol, and the period that patients wore the frame was substantially shortened. We conclude that IACTA is a practical and useful method for radiosurgical treatment planning of arteriovenous malformations.",2002 Nov 15,2002,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",54,4,1121-33,eng,False,S0360301602030109;10.1016/s0360-3016(02)03010-9,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;*Cerebral Angiography;Child;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Angiography;Male;Middle Aged;*Radiosurgery;*Tomography, X-Ray Computed",,False,0.09762811228190356,True

1782617,Current status of radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations.,"Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM), regardless of the mode of discovery, have an annual risk of hemorrhage of approximately 4 percent. A progressive obliterative vasculitis culminating in the occlusion of an AVM may be induced by the administration of radiation doses of approximately 20 Gy given in a single fraction. The process takes about two years and occlusion occurs in approximately 80% of patients so treated. Such a dose may be accurately administered to AVMs up to 3 cm in diameter with very little radiation imparted to the adjacent brain by means of multiple highly collimated radially arranged cobalt sources (the Gamma Knife) or by means of a modified linear accelerator turned through an arc or arcs with the target AVM as the centre of rotation. The Gamma Knife and the modified linear accelerator have nearly equal accuracy. Recent experience with modified linear accelerators indicates efficacy equal to the Gamma Knife. Both devices are effective treatment for small AVMs but the cost of modifying a pre-existing linear accelerator is only a few percent of the acquisition and installation costs of the Gamma Knife.",1991 Nov,1991,The Canadian journal of neurological sciences.

We performed a retrospective review between 1 January 1999 and 31 December 2017 for ruptured bAVM in a regional neurosurgical centre in Hong Kong. All other vascular pathologies and unruptured cases were excluded. Thirty-three eligible patients were included for analysis. The median age at presentation was 12 (3-18), with a slight male preponderance. Presenting complaints included headache (60.6%), motor deficits (24.2%), and seizure (6.1%). Glasgow coma scale (GCS) on presentation (median, IQR) was 15 (13-15). bAVMs were lobar in 57.6%, infratentorial in 27.3%, and basal ganglia in 9.1%. Follow-up was 101 ± 61 months and ranged from 24 to 229 months. 12 (36.4%) patients underwent emergency haematoma evacuation with or without bAVM excision because of neurological deterioration in the acute phase. 7 (21.2%) patients underwent interval excision and 11(33.3%) patients underwent stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). There was no residual bAVM and no Clavien-Dindo complications greater than grade II in interval surgery group. Those who underwent SRS had a significantly higher Spetzler-Martin grade; bAVM obliteration was achieved at 73.3%, without any major symptomatic post-radiosurgery complications. There was 1 (3%) mortality and 30 (90.9%) patients recovered well with minor non-disabling deficits (GOS 5).

30071340,Effect of Advanced Age on Stereotactic Radiosurgery Outcomes for Brain Arteriovenous Malformations: A Multicenter Matched Cohort Study.,"BACKGROUND: The effect of age on adult brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM) outcomes after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) remains unclear. The aim of this study is to compare AVM outcomes between elderly (age ≥60 years) and nonelderly adult patients. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed pooled data comprising patients who underwent SRS for AVMs between 1987 and 2014 at 8 centers participating in the International Gamma Knife Research Foundation. Adult (age ≥18 years) patients with ≥12 months follow-up were dichotomized into elderly and nonelderly cohorts, and matched in a 1:1 ratio. Favorable outcome was AVM obliteration without permanent symptomatic radiation-induced changes (RIC) or post-SRS hemorrhage. RESULTS: The study cohort consisted of 1845 patients (188 elderly vs. 1657 nonelderly) who met the inclusion criteria, and subsequent matching resulted in 181 patients in each cohort. In the matched cohorts, rates of obliteration (54.7% vs. 64.6%; P = 0.054) favorable outcome (51.4% vs. 61.3%; P = 0.056) were no different between the elderly and nonelderly cohorts. The rates of post-SRS hemorrhage (9.9% vs. 5.5%; P = 0.115), RIC (26.5% vs. 30.9%; P = 0.353), symptomatic RIC (9.4% vs. 9.4%; P = 1.000), and permanent symptomatic RIC (3.3% vs. 2.2%; P = 0.750) were also not significantly different between the elderly and nonelderly cohorts. Elderly patients with AVM did have a significantly higher rate of all-cause mortality (27.7% vs. 5.5%; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Advanced age does not seem to significantly affect obliteration or complication rates after SRS for AVMs. Although the decision to recommend intervention for AVMs in the elderly population is multifactorial, SRS may be a viable modality when treatment is deemed appropriate.",2018 Nov,2018,World neurosurgery,119,,e429-e440,eng,True,S1878-8750(18)31656-5;10.1016/j.wneu.2018.07.178;S1878-8750(18)31656-5;10.1016/j.wneu.2018.07.178,Journal Article;Multicenter Study,"Adult;Age Factors;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/epidemiology/*radiotherapy;Male;Middle Aged;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome",Age;Arteriovenous malformation;Cerebrovascular;Gamma Knife;Old;Radiosurgery,True,0.820625779753017,True

22623087,Management of ruptured brain arteriovenous malformations.,"Intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are a common cause of stroke in younger patients, and often present as intracerebral hemorrhages (ICH), associated with 10 % to 30 % mortality. Patients who present with a hemorrhage from an AVM should be initially stabilized according to acute management guidelines for ICH. The characteristics of a lesion including its size, location in eloquent tissue, and high-risk features will influence risk of rupture, prognosis, as well as help guide management decisions. Given that rupture is associated with an increased risk of 6 % re-rupture in the year following the initial hemorrhage, versus 1 % to 3 % predicted annual risk in non-ruptured lesions only, definitive treatment is encouraged after ICH stabilization. A rest period of 2 to 6 weeks after hemorrhage is recommended before definitive treatment to avoid disrupting friable parenchyma and the hematoma.

The aim of the present study was to assess the long-term outcomes and risks of SRS for AVMs in pediatric patients (age < 18 years). METHODS: The authors retrospectively analyzed the International Radiosurgery Research Foundation pediatric AVM database for the years 1987 to 2018. AVM obliteration, post-SRS hemorrhage, cyst formation, and tumor formation were assessed. Cumulative probabilities, adjusted for the competing risk of death, were calculated. RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 539 pediatric AVM patients (mean follow-up 85.8 months). AVM obliteration was observed in 64.3% of patients, with cumulative probabilities of 63.6% (95% CI 58.8%-68.0%), 77.1% (95% CI 72.1%-81.3%), and 88.1% (95% CI 82.5%-92.0%) over 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively. Post-SRS hemorrhage was observed in 8.4% of patients, with cumulative probabilities of 4.9% (95% CI 3.1%-7.2%), 9.7% (95% CI 6.4%-13.7%), and 14.5% (95% CI 9.5%-20.5%) over 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively. Cyst formation was observed in 2.1% of patients, with cumulative probabilities of 5.5% (95% CI 2.3%-10.7%) and 6.9% (95% CI 3.1%-12.9%) over 10 and 15 years, respectively. Meningiomas were observed in 2 patients (0.4%) at 10 and 12 years after SRS, with a cumulative probability of 3.1% (95% CI 0.6%-9.7%) over 15 years. CONCLUSIONS: AVM obliteration can be expected after SRS in the majority of the pediatric population, with a relatively low risk of hemorrhage during the latency period. Cyst and benign tumor formation after SRS can be observed in 7% and 3% of patients over 15 years, respectively.

7502732,Treatment of symptomatic AOVMs with radiosurgery.,"In spite of great success in the treatment cerebral AVMs with stereotactic radiosurgery, the role of this treatment modality in angiographically occult vascular malformations (AOVMs) is not recognized. Since the installation of the Gamma-knife, we have treated 20 cases of AOVMs by radiosurgery. There were 13 males and 7 females, the age ranged from 3 to 58 years with an average age of 34.0 years. Their clinical presentations at the onset were haemorrhage in 11, convulsive seizure in 7 and progressive neurological deficits in 2. Two cases had multiple lesions. Among 20 symptomatic lesions, 14 were located supratentorially, 4 in the brain stem and 2 in the cerebellar hemispheres. Following localization with MRI and dose planning, the lesions were treated by radiosurgery and the doses ranged from 15 to 20 Gy at the margins. Follow-up studies indicate a significant control of rebleeding as well as of the convulsive seizure. Imaging studies demonstrated the shrinkage of the lesion in 3 and reduced enhancement with Gadolinium-DTPA in some others. Adverse effects, chiefly related to radiation-induced oedema, occurred in 5. But they were generally mild and well controlled by medication. Thus the preliminary results indicate a certain usefulness of radiosurgery in the treatment of symptomatic AOVMs.",1995,1995,Acta neurochirurgica.

39652987,Arteriovenous malformations treated by stereotactic radiosurgery - Review of an Australian single centre's experience.,"Linear accelerator (LINAC) stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a specialised treatment used for various brain conditions, including arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). This paper investigates the obliteration rate of AVMs treated by the LINAC-based facility at Prince of Wales Hospital, defines factors influencing obliteration rate, time to obliteration and complications post-SRS. A retrospective audit review of patient notes sourced from electronic medical records was conducted. During the study period 219 patients received treatment, of which the final status of 136 AVMs was known. Overall obliteration rate was 75.7 %, with obliteration rates of 5 %, 30 % and 46 % at one, three and four years, respectively. Post analysis, a radiosurgery dose of ≥ 18 Gray (Gy) was predictive of achieving obliteration (Odds Ratio (OR) 4.2, 95 % Confidence Interval (CI) 1.61-10.83, p = 0.003) whilst a nidus size of 3-6 cm was less likely of achieving obliteration (OR 0.2, CI 0.10-0.57, p = 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed a radiosurgery dose of ≥ 18 Gy remained predictive (OR 4.7, CI 1.69-13.25, p = 0.003) and a nidus size of 3-6 cm remained less likely to achieve obliteration (OR 0.2, CI 0.10-0.57, p = 0.001). Females were predictive of developing temporary complications post-SRS in multivariate analysis (OR 2.8, CI 1.24-6.13, p = 0.013), and having > 1 SRS session was predictive of developing permanent complications post-SRS (OR 7.1, CI 2.44-20.53, p < 0.001).

38710602,Trans-radial cerebral angiography for stereotactic radiosurgery treatment of arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVES: The popularity of trans-radial access (TRA) for cerebral angiography is growing. Potential benefits of TRA over traditional trans-femoral access (TFA) are multitude. This study aimed to evaluate discharge outcomes and patient opinion of TRA compared to TFA in patients undergoing cerebral angiography prior to stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) treatment for cerebral arteriovenous malformations. METHODS: Consecutive patients treated at the National Centre for Stereotactic Radiosurgery (Sheffield, United Kingdom) over a 22-month period were included. All patients underwent cerebral angiography with either TRA or TFA as part of treatment planning prior to SRS. TRA patients who had previously undergone TFA in other centres were surveyed for their experience of cerebral angiography using a questionnaire. SRS staff at our centre was approached for their opinion. RESULTS: 492 patients were included (median age = 43 years, 57.5% male, median lesions treated = 1). More patients underwent angiography with TFA (75.2%) than TRA (24.8%). No difference was found in accumulated dose for angiography between the groups (p>0.05). There was 17.6% reduction in overnight stay between TRA and TRF, the proportion of patients requiring overnight admission was higher for the TFA (35.2%) than TRA (17.6%, p<0.05). 101 patients were surveyed, with a response rate of 47%. Most respondents (79%) indicated preference for TRA over TFA. CONCLUSIONS: Use of TRA in pre-SRS cerebral angiography is feasible and improves both patient and staff experience.

10962723,[The influence of radiation doses on the results of radiosurgery of brain arteriovenous malformations].,"Stereotactic radiosurgery as a method of treatment of inoperable brain angiomas has been in use in the Neurosurgery Department, Medical Academy in Lublin since 1990. The patients receive radiation from a Neptune 10P linear accelerator of 9 MeV photon energy (X radiation). The Laitinen stereoadapter used by us makes possible precise targeting and radiation application in time suitable for the patient and the whole treatment team. This frame produces no disturbances of CT image and is not covering the target. Non-invasive head immobilization in the frame is highly stable, although it requires good communication with the patient and his full cooperation. The purpose of the study was a comparison of the results of radiosurgery applied in the treatment of inoperable brain angiomas of various size with radiation doses 4000 cGy and 3000 cGy. The material comprises 40 first cases out of over 120 patients treated in this way for inoperable angiomas. The first group of 20 patients received 4000 cGy and the second group of 20 patients received 3000 cGy doses. Complete obliteration of angiomas was achieved in 16 (80%) cases treated with the 4000 cGy dose, and in 17 (85%) cases treated with the 3000 cGy dose. Late postradiation reactions developed in 15 (75%) patients in the first group with permanent changes in 5 (25%) patients. In the second group late postradiation reactions developed in only 6 (30%) cases and regressed in all. Treatment effectiveness (complete obliteration) after doses of 3000 and 4000 cGy was similar, and it decreased with greater size of angiomas. The per cent of postradiation complications after lower doses was much smaller, and permanent neurological changes were seen only after higher doses.

35077887,Predictive Factors for Arteriovenous Malformation Obliteration After Stereotactic Radiosurgery: A Single-Center Study.,"BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is particularly useful for treatment of deep arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in eloquent territory with a high associated surgical risk. Prior studies have demonstrated high rates of AVM obliteration with SRS (60%-80%) in a latency period of 2-4 years for complete obliteration. Studies have identified several factors associated with successful obliteration of the AVM nidus; however, these present inconsistent and conflicting data. The aim of this single-center study was to examine factors associated with successful obliteration of AVMs treated with SRS. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of 210 consecutive patients undergoing SRS for brain AVMs between 2010 and 2019. The χ(2) test and logistic regression analysis were used to identify patient and AVM factors associated with successful obliteration. RESULTS: Younger age (P = 0.034) and prior embolization (P = 0.012) were associated with complete obliteration. The presence of coronary artery disease was associated with incomplete obliteration (P = 0.04). No AVM characteristics were statistically associated with complete obliteration, although superficial venous drainage (P = 0.08) and frontal location (P = 0.06) trended toward significance. CONCLUSIONS: Successful obliteration of the AVM nidus was significantly associated with younger age and prior embolization. The presence of coronary artery disease negatively affected obliteration rates. These results add to the mixed results seen in the literature and emphasize the need for continued studies to delineate more specific patient and AVM factors that contribute to successful obliteration.",2022 Apr,2022,World neurosurgery,160,,e529-e536,eng,True,S1878-8750(22)00073-0;10.1016/j.wneu.2022.01.060;S1878-8750(22)00073-0;10.1016/j.wneu.2022.01.060,Journal Article,"*Embolization, Therapeutic/methods;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/radiotherapy/surgery;*Radiosurgery/methods;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome",AVM;Obliteration;Stereotactic radiosurgery,True,0.5857183402439333,True

27153378,Long-term hemorrhagic risk in pediatric patients with arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVE Compared with the general population, the specific natural history of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in pediatric patients is less well understood. Furthermore, few pediatric studies have compared posttreatment hemorrhagic risk and functional outcome across different treatment modalities. The objective of this study was to elucidate these points. METHODS The authors retrospectively reviewed all pediatric patients with AVMs evaluated at their institution between 1990 and 2013. The AVM natural history was represented by hemorrhagic risk during the observation period. For treated patients, the observation period was defined as the interval between diagnosis and treatment. Posttreatment hemorrhagic risk and functional outcomes were also assessed. RESULTS A total of 124 pediatric patients with AVMs were evaluated, and 90 patients (72.6%) were retained through follow-up. The average patient age was 13.3 ± 3.8 years, with a mean follow-up period of 9.95 years. The overall AVM obliteration rate was 59.7%. Radiosurgery had an obliteration rate of 49.0%. Thirteen patients were managed conservatively. Four patients under observation hemorrhaged during a total interval of 429.4 patient-years, translating to an annual risk of 0.9%. Posttreatment hemorrhagic risk by treatment modalities were categorized as follows: surgery ± embolization (0.0%), radiosurgery ± embolization (0.8%), embolization alone (2.8%), surgery + radiosurgery ± embolization (3.5%), and observation (0.8%). A significantly higher risk of posttreatment hemorrhage was observed for patients with hemorrhagic presentation (p = 0.043) in multivariate analysis. Seizure presentation, frontal lobe location, nonheadache presentation, and treatment modality were significantly associated with increased risk of poor functional outcomes. CONCLUSIONS In this study of pediatric patients with AVMs, the natural history of hemorrhage was relatively low at 0.9%. Resection remained the optimal management for hemorrhage control and functional outcome perseverance in these pediatric patients with AVMs. AVM obliteration is a valid treatment goal, especially for patients with ruptured presentation, to prevent further hemorrhages later in life.",2016 Sep,2016,Journal of neurosurgery.

16338096,"Gamma Knife radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations in children/adolescents and adults. Part II: Differences in obliteration rates, treatment-obliteration intervals, and prognostic factors.","PURPOSE: To evaluate and compare obliteration rates (OBRs) and treatment-obliteration intervals (TOIs) for cerebral arteriovenous malformations (cAVMs) treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery in children/adolescents and adults; and to determine factors predicting the OBR and TOI in these two populations. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This study concerned 62 children/adolescents and 193 adults observed for > or = 3 years. Fisher exact two-tailed and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, multiple logistics, and Cox proportional hazard models were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The overall OBR was 85.5% in children/adolescents and 87.6% in adults (p = 0.671), but children/adolescents showed higher 36-month actuarial OBRs (69.35%) and shorter median TOIs (25.7 months) than adults (66.84% and 28.2 months; p = 0.006 and p = 0.017, respectively). In children/adolescents, lower Spetzler-Martin grades (p = 0.043) and younger age (p = 0.019) correlated significantly with OBRs, and lower Spetzler-Martin grades (p = 0.024) and noneloquent cAVM locations (p = 0.046) with TOIs. In adults, low flow through the cAVM and < 6.2-cm3 volume were associated with both OBR and TOI (p = 0.012 and p = 0.002, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The differences in OBRs within 3 years and TOIs, although slight, seem to show that pediatric cAVMs behave differently from those in adults after Gamma Knife radiosurgery.",2006 Mar 1,2006,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",64,3,914-21,eng,True,S0360-3016(05)02604-0;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2005.09.013,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Age Factors;Aged;Analysis of Variance;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Prognosis;Proportional Hazards Models;*Radiosurgery;Radiotherapy Dosage;Retreatment;Retrospective Studies;Time Factors",,True,0.5279327522404808,True

The treatment consists of sending multiple narrow radiation beams from different directions to the volume of tissue to be treated by rotating the radiation source and the patient table in relation to each other. Mega-voltage radiation from a linear accelerator is used. A non-invasive stereotactic frame is mounted on the patient and a CT scan of the brain is performed to localize the center and extent of the tissue to be treated. The radiation treatment is then given by using the coordinates on the frame to assure that the center of rotation of the treatment table and the linear accelerator pass through the center of the volume of tissue. The method has been used to give radiation boosts after external radiation to brain tumours, and to treat patients with recurrent tumours.

31841722,Ectopic Recurrence of Arteriovenous Malformation After Radiosurgery: Case Report and Insight Regarding Pathogenesis.,"BACKGROUND: While prior studies reporting de novo arteriovenous malformations after birth are not uncommon, reports of ectopic recurrence of arteriovenous malformation after radiotherapy are scarce. CASE DESCRIPTION: An 8-year-old girl with a ruptured cerebellar arteriovenous malformation was treated with stereotactic radiosurgery. The nidus was completely obliterated 17 months after stereotactic radiosurgery; however, 20 years later she had a rupture of a recurrent nidus that occurred adjacent to the original nidus, accompanied by a radiation-induced cyst. Surgical resection was performed, and subsequent pathologic examination revealed 2 different compartments: a typical nidus and a postirradiated degenerated nidus with an encapsulated hematoma. Immunohistochemical stains showed increased expression of Ki-67 and decreased expression of endoglin in endothelial cells in the recurrent nidus. CONCLUSIONS: Depletion in endoglin may lead to the formation of vessel malformations in the presence of angiogenic stimuli. This case serves as a strong reminder of the importance of long-term follow-up after stereotactic radiosurgery, especially for pediatric cases.",2020 Mar,2020,World neurosurgery,135,,63-67,eng,False,S1878-8750(19)33006-2;10.1016/j.wneu.2019.11.156;S1878-8750(19)33006-2;10.1016/j.wneu.2019.11.156,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Adult;Brain Neoplasms/etiology/pathology/surgery;Female;Hematoma/etiology/pathology/surgery;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*etiology/pathology/*therapy;Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/pathology/surgery;*Radiosurgery;Recurrence;Rupture, Spontaneous/etiology/pathology/radiotherapy",Arteriovenous malformation;Endoglin;Gamma Knife;Stereotactic radiosurgery,False,0.06764092729064503,True
25753234,"Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformations and Epilepsy, Part 1: Predictors of Seizure Presentation.","OBJECTIVE: Seizures are relatively common in patients harboring cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Because the pathogenesis of AVM-associated epilepsy is not well-defined, we aim to determine the factors associated with seizure presentation in AVM patients. METHODS: We evaluated our institutional AVM radiosurgery database, from 1989-2013, to select patients in whom pertinent clinical information at presentation and adequate clinical and radiologic follow-up was available. Baseline patient demographics and AVM angioarchitectural features were compared between patients with and without seizure presentation. In addition to standard descriptive statistics, logistic regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of seizure presentation. RESULTS: Of the 1007 AVM patients included for analysis, 229 patients presented with seizures (22.7%). The incidence of seizure presentation was significantly higher in cortical than noncortical AVMs (33.1% vs. 6.6%, P < 0.0001). Among the cortical locations, occipital AVMs had the lowest rate of seizure presentation (21.5%, P = 0.0012), whereas the rates of seizure presentation in frontal (37.3%), temporal (37.7%), and parietal (34.0%) AVMs were similar. The lack of prior AVM hemorrhage (P < 0.0001), larger nidus diameter (P < 0.0001), and cortical location (P < 0.0001) were independent predictors of seizure presentation in the multivariate analysis. The strongest independent predictors of seizure presentation were lack of prior AVM hemorrhage (OR 16.8) and cortical location (OR 4.2). CONCLUSIONS: Large, unruptured, cortical nidi are most prone to seizure presentation in patients referred for radiosurgery.

19834376,The protective status of subtotal obliteration of arteriovenous malformations after radiosurgery: significance and risk of hemorrhage.,"OBJECTIVE: Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) treated by radiosurgery with complete obliteration of the nidus but a persisting early draining vein on follow-up angiography can be termed subtotally obliterated. However, these are persistent circulating AVMs. The significance of these lesions, their hemorrhage rate, and their management are analyzed. METHODS: In a series of 862 consecutive patients with AVMs treated by radiosurgery, 121 patients (14%) achieved subtotal obliteration (STO). The angiographic evolution and rate of obliteration were studied. The pretreatment angiographic features, dosimetric parameters, and postradiosurgery hemorrhage rate were compared with those in the rest of the treated population. Finally, the options for follow-up and treatment were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 121 subtotally obliterated AVMs, the bleeding rate was 0%; 53% of patients achieved complete obliteration. This occurred in 71% of those who had STO at 1 year. In the cases in which STO was detected at 2, 3, and 4 years, total obliteration eventually occurred in 43%, 28.5%, and 0%, respectively. Comparative analysis with AVMs in which a part of the nidus persisted showed a significant difference in the bleeding rate. Except for volume, no significant statistical difference in angiographic and dosimetric parameters was found between the STO group and the rest of the studied population with residual nidus. Six cases received further treatment, resulting in 2 cures and 2 treatment-related complications. CONCLUSION: Subtotally obliterated AVMs are different from other partially obliterated AVMs, with a 0% bleeding rate. Their complete obliteration is a function of delay of appearance on follow-up angiography.

15255246,Analysis of nidus obliteration rates after gamma knife surgery for arteriovenous malformations based on long-term follow-up data: the University of Tokyo experience.,"OBJECT: A large number of clinical studies have been made on treatment outcomes of radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), but the reported obliteration rates following this treatment vary significantly, perhaps reflecting the different methods and timings of the imaging studies used. METHODS: The authors retrospectively analyzed their experience with gamma knife surgery in 400 patients with AVMs (follow-up period 1-135 months, median 65 months), with special reference to the imaging modality used in each case. The calculated obliteration rates varied from 68.2 to 92%, depending on imaging modality and timing of evaluation. When only unquestionable imaging data such as demonstrations of a residual nidus on computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) images or findings on angiograms were used in the calculation, the obliteration rates were 72% at 3 years and 87.3% at 5 years. Factors leading to a better obliteration rate were previous hemorrhage (p = 0.0084), smaller nidus (p = 0.0023), and higher radiation dose to the lesion's margin (p = 0.0495), as determined in a multivariate analysis. Factors leading to an earlier obliteration of the nidus were male sex (p = 0.0001), previous hemorrhage (p = 0.0039), smaller nidus diameter (p = 0.0006), and dose planning using angiography alone (p = 0.0201). CONCLUSIONS: After the introduction of CT and MR images into dose planning, the conformity and selectivity of dosimetry improved remarkably, although the latency intervals until obliteration were prolonged. Imaging outcomes for AVMs should be evaluated using data provided by longer follow-up periods. The timing of additional treatments for residual AVMs should be decided cautiously, considering the size of the AVM, the patient age and sex, and the history of hemorrhage before radiosurgery.",2004 Jul,2004,Journal of neurosurgery,101,1,18-24,eng,True,10.3171/jns.2004.101.1.0018,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/pathology/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Radiography;*Radiosurgery;Reoperation;Retrospective Studies;Time Factors;Tokyo;Treatment Outcome",,True,0.637138544183171,True
36907366,Age-Dependent Hemorrhage Risk and Obliteration Benefit After Radiosurgery for Brain Arteriovenous Malformation.,"PURPOSE: Because patients with untreated brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVMs) are at variable risks of cerebral hemorrhage and associated mortality and morbidity, it is essential to identify patient populations who benefit most from prophylactic interventions. This study aimed to examine age-dependent differences in the therapeutic effect of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) on BAVMs. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This retrospective observational study enrolled patients with BAVMs who underwent SRS at our institution between 1990 and 2017. The primary outcome was post-SRS hemorrhage, and the secondary outcomes included nidus obliteration, post-SRS early signal changes, and mortality. To investigate age-related differences in outcomes after SRS, we performed age-stratified analyses using the Kaplan-Meier analysis and weighted logistic regression with the inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW). To address significant differences in patient baseline characteristics, we also performed inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) adjusted for possible confounders to investigate age-related differences in outcomes after SRS. RESULTS: A total of 735 patients with 738 BAVMs were stratified by age. Age-stratified analysis using a weighted logistic regression model with IPCW showed a direct correlation between patient age and post-SRS hemorrhage (odds ratio [OR], 95% confidence interval [CI], and P value: 2.20, 1.34-3.63, and .002 at 18 months; 1.86, 1.17-2.93, and .008 at 36 months; and 1.61, 1.05-2.48, and .030 at 54 months, respectively). The age-stratified analysis also showed an inverse relationship between age and obliteration over the first 42 months after SRS (OR, 95% CI, and P value: 0.05, 0.02-0.12, and <.001 at 6 months; 0.55, 0.44-0.70, and <.001 at 24 months; and 0.76, 0.63-0.91, and .002 at 42 months, respectively). These results were also confirmed with the IPTW analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis demonstrated that patients' age at SRS is significantly associated with hemorrhage and the nidus obliteration rate after treatment. In particular, younger patients are more likely to exhibit reduced cerebral hemorrhages and achieve earlier nidus obliteration compared with older patients.",2023 Aug 1,2023,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",116,5,1126-1134,eng,True,S0360-3016(23)00213-4;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2023.02.059;S0360-3016(23)00213-4;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2023.02.059,Journal Article;Observational Study,"Humans;Child, Preschool;Treatment Outcome;Follow-Up Studies;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects/methods;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/radiotherapy;Brain;Retrospective Studies;Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology",,True,0.6741395172563472,True

This systematic review aims to investigate the outcomes following bAVM treatment when tractography data is incorporated into treatment planning. PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Cochrane Library, were searched for published studies. Prospective or retrospective studies involving at least one patient with confirmed bAVM and available data on tractography and clinical outcomes were included. A total of 16 studies were eligible for this review, consisting of 298 patients. 48.2% of patients were female. The mean age of the patients was 27.5 years (range: 5-77). Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and microsurgical resection each were the treatment of choice in eight studies, respectively. Two-hundred forty-eight patients underwent SRS as the primary treatment, while microsurgery was used to resect the bAVMs in 50 patients. The corticospinal tract, optic pathway, and arcuate fasciculus were the most widely investigated white matter tracts. Tractography disruption and failure frequencies were 19.1% and 1.8%, respectively. The pooled proportions (95% CI) of obliteration rates were 88.78% (73.51-95.76) for microsurgery and 51.45% (13-17-88.10) following SRS. Treatment-related non-hemorrhagic complications rates occurred in 24.2% and 9.9% of patients who underwent microsurgical resection and SRS, respectively.

9002712,Arteriovenous malformations of the corpus callosum--radioanatomic study and effectiveness of intranidus embolization.,"Forty-three patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the corpus callosum treated by embolization were reviewed. The following clinical and radioanatomic characteristics were found: 84% (36 patients) presented with intracranial hemorrhage, 43% (20 nidi) of the lesions were located in the posterior half of the corpus callosum, multiple nidi were more frequent (21%) than expected, 27 nidi (59%) were fed by branches of both the anterior and posterior cerebral arteries, AVMs mainly drained into the internal cerebral vein and/or interhemispheric superficial veins, and 19 (41%) had both draining pathways, 10 patients (23%) had impaired drainage through the straight sinus due to dysplasia. Staged embolization was performed in 245 feeders. Curative occlusion (more than 95%) was obtained in 17 patients (40%) and considerable occlusion (more than 75%) in 33 patients (77%). Large and giant, diffuse-type, and multifocal AVMs were difficult to completely embolize. Complications associated with embolization occurred in six patients, mostly during the first 5 years. Only two patients had a permanent deficit related to a complication. Overall morbidity and mortality were 7% and 2%, respectively. Nine patients were referred for stereotactic radiosurgery, three of whom were completely cured and five patients have not been assessed. Most AVMs in the corpus callosum are supplied by multi-axial feeders, so multi-target intranidus embolization is very important to prevent the development of other feeders secondary to the hemodynamic shift.

12171335,Prediction of AVM obliteration after stereotactic radiotherapy using radiobiological modelling.,"This study was carried out in order to derive the radiobiological parameters of the dose-response relation for the obliteration of arteriovenous malformation (AVM) following single fraction stereotactic radiotherapy. Furthermore, the accuracy by which the linear Poisson model predicts the probability of obliteration and how the haemorrhage history, location and volume of the AVM influence its radiosensitivity are investigated. The study patient material consists of 85 patients who received radiation for AVM therapy. Radiation-induced AVM obliterations were assessed on the basis of post-irradiation angiographies and other radiological findings. For each patient the dose delivered to the clinical target volume and the clinical treatment outcome were available. These data were used in a maximum likelihood analysis to calculate the best estimates of the parameters of the linear Poisson model. The uncertainties of these parameters were also calculated and their individual influence on the dose-response curve was studied. AVM radiosensitivity was assumed to be the same for all the patients. The radiobiological model used was proved suitable for predicting the treatment outcome pattern of the studied patient material. The radiobiological parameters of the model were calculated for different AVM locations, bleeding histories and AVM sizes. The range of parameter variability had considerable effect on the dose-response curve of AVM. The correlation between the dosimetric data and their corresponding clinical effect could be accurately modelled using the linear Poisson model. The derived response parameters can be introduced into the clinical routine with the calculated accuracy assuming the same methodology in target definition and delineation. The known volume dependence of AVM radiosensitivity was confirmed. Moreover, a trend relating AVM location with its radiosensitivity was observed.",2002 Jul 21,2002,Physics in medicine and biology,47,14,2471-94,eng,False,10.1088/0031-9155/47/14/308,"Evaluation Study;Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Cerebral Arteries/abnormalities/surgery;Cerebral Veins/abnormalities/surgery;Child;Dose Fractionation, Radiation;*Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Models, Biological;*Models, Cardiovascular;Models, Statistical;Radiosurgery/*methods;Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted/*methods;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome",,False,0.186397748855855,True

21345621,Pretreatment predictors of adverse radiation effects after radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformation.,"PURPOSE: To identify vascular and dosimetric predictors of symptomatic T2 signal change and adverse radiation effects after radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformation, in order to define and validate preexisting risk models. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 125 patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVM) were treated at our institution between 2005 and 2009. Eighty-five patients have at least 12 months of clinical and radiological follow-up. Any new-onset headaches, new or worsening seizures, or neurological deficit were considered adverse events. Follow-up magnetic resonance images were assessed for new onset T2 signal change and the volume calculated. Pretreatment characteristics and dosimetric variables were analyzed to identify predictors of adverse radiation effects. RESULTS: There were 19 children and 66 adults in the study cohort, with a mean age of 34 (range 6-74). Twenty-three (27%) patients suffered adverse radiation effects (ARE), 9 patients with permanent neurological deficit (10.6%). Of these, 5 developed fixed visual field deficits. Target volume and 12 Gy volume were the most significant predictors of adverse radiation effects on univariate analysis (p < 0.001). Location and cortical eloquence were not significantly associated with the development of adverse events (p = 0.12). No additional vascular parameters were identified as predictive of ARE. There was a significant target volume threshold of 4 cm(3), above which the rate of ARE increased dramatically. Multivariate analysis target volume and the absence of prior hemorrhage are the only significant predictors of ARE. The volume of T2 signal change correlates to ARE, but only target volume is predictive of a higher volume of T2 signal change. CONCLUSIONS: Target volume and the absence of prior hemorrhage is the most accurate predictor of adverse radiation effects and complications after radiosurgery for AVMs. A high percentage of permanent visual field defects in this series suggest the optic radiation is a critical radiosensitive structure.",2012 Feb 1,2012,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",82,2,803-8,eng,False,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2010.12.014;S0360-3016(10)03711-9;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2010.12.014,Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Analysis of Variance;Child;Female;Headache/etiology;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods;Male;Middle Aged;Paresis/etiology;Radiation Injuries/*diagnosis;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects/methods;Radiotherapy Dosage;Retrospective Studies;Risk Assessment/methods;Seizures/etiology;Vision Disorders/etiology;Young Adult,,False,0.3789471047510247,True
28669269,Microsurgical management of a high-grade brain arteriovenous malformation in the central lobe after unsuccessful radiosurgery.,"The recommendation for the great majority of high-grade brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) is observation, except for those patients with recurrent hemorrhages, progressive neurological deficits, steal-related symptoms, or AVM-related aneurysms, for whom intervention should be considered. These are general recommendations, and the decision should be made on an individual basis. Surgical resection of an AVM in the central lobe may cause postoperative sensorimotor deficits since this anatomical region includes the pre- and postcentral gyri on the lateral surface and the paracentral lobule on the medial surface. The authors present a patient with a ruptured high-grade bAVM in the central lobe who underwent previous surgery for hematoma evacuation and previous radiosurgery, and whose indication for reoperation was proposed based on progressive hemiparesis. Microsurgical resection was possible after a wide frontoparietal craniotomy, which made all the nidus borders accessible. This case illustrates the anatomy and surgical technique for large nidus AVMs in eloquent areas, showing that complete microsurgical resection is possible with good clinical outcome.

39023594,Comparison of imaging modalities for the accurate delineation of arteriovenous malformations (AVM) and evaluation of setup accuracy with reference to non-invasive LINAC-based stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).,"AIMS: To compare the accuracy of nidus delineation using magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) to digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and to evaluate setup accuracy of non-invasive frame SRS treatments. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A prospective observational study of 16 patients who underwent non-invasive frame LINAC-based SRS for brain AVMs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The nidus was separately delineated using DSA and MRA after co-registration onto CT simulation images and compared with respect to their volume and maximum diameters. During treatment, the setup errors observed in x-, y-, and z-directions were recorded. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Paired t-test (to compare volume and maximum diameter). Wilcoxon signed-rank test (for setup accuracy). RESULTS: The mean volume of nidus contoured in MRA was 4.16 cc compared to 3.11 cc in DSA (P 0.297). The mean maximum diameters using MRA and DSA, respectively, in antro-posterior, cranio- caudal, and transverse diameters were 21.97 cc vs. 19.46 cc (P 0.2380), 6.59 cc vs. 9.63 cc (P 0.161), and 18.87 cc vs. 16.81 cc (P 0.178). But these modalities can potentially misinterpret the nidus volume, warranting caution for use of either modality alone. The mean translational shift observed in the x-, y-, and z-directions were 0.06 mm, 0.13 mm, and 0.13 mm, respectively, when couch was brought to neutral position after clockwise couch rotation and 0.07, 0, and 0, respectively, after counterclockwise couch rotation.

The optimum parameters of stereotaxic aspiration, including speed of screw rotation and amount of suction, have been determined experimentally. Computerized tomography scanning was used to locate the hematoma site, to assess its volume, and to determine stereotaxic coordinates. A new method of preventing rebleeding is also described. This procedure was used to aspirate hematomas in 32 patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage, including one case caused by aneurysmal rupture and one secondary to rupture of an arteriovenous malformation. All patients were operated on in a severely comatose or semicomatose state. In all but four cases, the hematomas were almost totally removed. Three patients were operated on twice because of recurrent bleeding. The mortality rate for the series was 22%. A preliminary conclusion is made that this new method is safer and less traumatic than open surgery in most cases of severe intracerebral hematoma.",1985 Feb,1985,Journal of neurosurgery,62,2,206-13,eng,False,10.3171/jns.1985.62.2.0206,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Adult;Cerebral Hemorrhage/*surgery;Cerebral Ventricles/surgery;Female;Hematoma/*surgery;Humans;Intracranial Aneurysm/surgery;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Rupture, Spontaneous;Stereotaxic Techniques/*instrumentation",,False,0.06870555018897882,True

RESULTS: In our series all patients received Leksell SRS with the periphery of the AVM receiving doses ranging from 22-25 Gy. The time lapse from SRS to a clear enhancing mass appearing on imaging ranged from 5-10 years.

30641831,Stereotactic radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations of the basal ganglia and thalamus: an international multicenter study.,"OBJECTIVE: Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the basal ganglia (BG) and thalamus are associated with elevated risks of both hemorrhage if left untreated and neurological morbidity after resection. Therefore, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has become a mainstay in the management of these lesions, although its safety and efficacy remain incompletely understood. The aim of this retrospective multicenter cohort study was to evaluate the outcomes of SRS for BG and thalamic AVMs and determine predictors of successful endpoints and adverse radiation effects. METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed data on patients with BG or thalamic AVMs who had undergone SRS at eight institutions participating in the International Gamma Knife Research Foundation (IGKRF) from 1987 to 2014. Favorable outcome was defined as AVM obliteration, no post-SRS hemorrhage, and no permanently symptomatic radiation-induced changes (RICs). Multivariable models were developed to identify independent predictors of outcome. RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 363 patients with BG or thalamic AVMs. The mean AVM volume and SRS margin dose were 3.8 cm3 and 20.7 Gy, respectively. The mean follow-up duration was 86.5 months. Favorable outcome was achieved in 58.5% of patients, including obliteration in 64.8%, with rates of post-SRS hemorrhage and permanent RIC in 11.3% and 5.6% of patients, respectively. Independent predictors of favorable outcome were no prior AVM embolization (p = 0.011), a higher margin dose (p = 0.008), and fewer isocenters (p = 0.044). CONCLUSIONS: SRS is the preferred intervention for the majority of BG and thalamic AVMs. Patients with morphologically compact AVMs that have not been previously embolized are more likely to have a favorable outcome, which may be related to the use of a higher margin dose.",2020 Jan 1,2020,Journal of neurosurgery,132,1,122-131,eng,True,10.3171/2018.8.JNS182106;10.3171/2018.8.JNS182106,Journal Article;Multicenter Study,"Adolescent;Adult;Basal Ganglia/blood supply/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Embolization, Therapeutic;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Aneurysm/complications/therapy;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/diagnostic;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Neuroimaging;Postoperative Hemorrhage/etiology;Radiation Dosage;Radiation Injuries/etiology;Radiosurgery/adverse effects/*methods;Retrospective Studies;Thalamus/blood supply/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",AVM = arteriovenous malformation;BG = basal ganglia;DSA = digital subtraction angiography;EBRT = external beam radiation therapy;Gamma Knife;IGKRF = International Gamma Knife Research Foundation;RIC = radiation-induced change;SM = Spetzler-Martin;SRS = stereotactic radiosurgery;VRAS = Virginia Radiosurgery AVM Scale;basal ganglia;intracranial arteriovenous malformations;intracranial hemorrhages;mRBAS = modified radiosurgery-based AVM score;radiosurgery;stereotactic radiosurgery;stroke;thalamus;vascular disorders;vascular malformations,True,0.8509944344799035,True

The goal of embolization was to reduce the patient nidus to a size that facilitated successful stereotactic radiosurgery. Angiograms obtained 1 and 2 years after radiosurgery were evaluated for changes in nidus size, flow rate, and feeding and draining vessels. One year after stereotactic radiosurgery, one AVM was angiographically undetectable. Three other AVMs demonstrated a volume reduction of greater than 50%, in addition to decreased shunt speed and altered angioarchitecture at 1-year follow-up. At 2-year follow-ups, two of seven AVMs were cured, and an additional two of seven had a greater than 98% reduction in nidus volume. Although one patient experienced a transient deficit from embolotherapy, none of our patients suffered a new neurologic deficit or a hemorrhage during the follow-up period.

23419565,Long-term results of radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is known to safely result in a high obliteration rate for small and medium sized arteriovenous malformations (AVM). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term outcome of patients treated with SRS, with special emphasis given to obliteration and toxicity rates. METHODS: We performed a review of 43 cerebral AVM patients, treated from 1998 to 2008 with a single SRS dose ranging from 21-25 Gy. Of these, 37 had a minimal follow-up of one year. Medical files were reviewed to assess patient and AVM characteristics, the SRS treatment, therapy prior to SRS, the obliteration rate and toxicities. Whenever necessary, outcome data was supplemented by telephone interviews with the patient or treating physician. RESULTS: AVM size was ≥3cm in diameter in 21% of patients. Five patients (11.6%) underwent surgery prior to SRS and 31 patients (72.1%) received one or more embolizations prior to SRS. Of the patients followed with angiography ≥1 year post-SRS, 89% (33/37) had a complete obliteration of the nidus, after a median time of 24.7 months post-treatment. Embolization prior to SRS was not predictive of outcome. One patient suffered a non-fatal haemorrhage between treatment and obliteration. The rate of symptomatic radiation-induced radiological changes was 8.1%. CONCLUSION: Our study shows both obliteration and complication rates in the upper limit of those reported in the literature. SRS seems an attractive treatment option for small AVMs. Unlike other reports, the prior use of embolization did not impact negatively on obliteration rates.",2013 Mar,2013,The Canadian journal of neurological sciences.

7754816,Prognostic value of the Spetzler's grading system in a series of cerebral AVMs treated by a combined management.,"The prognostic value of the Spetzler's grading system is studied in a series of 52 AVMs treated by a combined management, using one or several of the 3 available techniques: surgical resection, endovascular embolization, radiosurgery. The symptoms at the time of treatment were haemorrhage 50%, seizures 31%, headache and deficit 19%. Three grade groups were considered: I and II (31%), III (33%), IV and V (36%). Overall, AVMs were managed as follows: resection alone 25%, embolization plus resection 23%, embolization alone 23%, radiosurgery with various combinations 29%. According to the grade groups, the most frequently used technique was resection alone for grade I-II AVMs (44%), radiosurgery for grade III AVMs (41%) and embolization alone for grade IV-V AVMs (42%). The clinical outcome was evaluated in terms of deterioration due to treatment. The best results were obtained in grade I-II AVMs (81% with no deterioration) then in grade III AVMs (65%) and in grade IV-V (58%). However, when we consider the outcome in terms of favourable results (no or only minor deterioration) we obtained a similar outcome for grade I-II and grade III AVMs (94% each), and only 79% for grade IV-V malformations. The angiographic outcome showed a better eradication rate in grade III AVMs (88% complete eradication), than in grade I-II AVMs (75%) and in grade IV-V (47%). Our conclusion is that the Spetzler's grading system in this series was well correlated with both the clinical and the angiographic outcome. However, we found no real difference between grade I-II and grade III AVMs. So, in terms of prognostic value, the grade I, II, and III AVMs could be considered together as low-grade malformations, with a better prognosis than the high-grade malformations (grade IV and V).",1994,1994,Acta neurochirurgica,131,3-4,169-75,eng,False,10.1007/BF01808608,Journal Article,"Adult;Aged;Cerebral Angiography;Combined Modality Therapy;*Craniotomy;*Embolization, Therapeutic;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*classification/diagnostic;Male;Middle Aged;Neurologic Examination;Postoperative Complications/diagnostic imaging;*Radiosurgery;Treatment Outcome",,False,0.2979248423275536,True
1845350,[Stereotaxic irradiation of 46 cerebral angiomas. Analysis of the angiographic results 2 and a half years after treatment].,"Between May 1986 and March 1987, 46 small and medium sized cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM) were treated by radiosurgery in Paris. The stereotaxic coordinates of the lesions were determined according to the method of J. Talairach and the total radiation dose was delivered on spherical or ovoid target volumes with minibeams of 18 MV photons, using the technique developed by Osvaldo Betti. A review of the cases was undertaken in december 89. Twenty-one patients had previously been treated by embolization and/or surgery (46.6%). During the 25 to 40 months follow-up there were only 2 recurrences of bleeding (4.3). Control arteriography was performed in 38 cases (38/46 = 82.6%). There were thirteen cases of total disappearance of the AVM (13/36 = 34.2%), 17 incomplete obliterations (44.7%) and 9 (23%) arteriographies failed to show any radiological improvement. Eight patients had no arteriographic follow-up: 2 of them experienced a recurrence of bleeding and died before the planned arteriography, 1 was lost to follow-up and 5 patients refused control arteriography. A multidisciplinary team is needed to study the shape, the volume, the hemodynamic features of the AVM and the dosimetry in order to attain the best definition of the target volume and of the dose distribution. It seems that when the target volume included the nidus and the venous collector, follow-up arteriography results were satisfactory.

Cerebral angiograms of twenty-five AVMs were retrospectively evaluated, and the stagnation rates in the nidus were calculated before and one year after stereotactic radiosurgery. Reduction rate was also calculated by using angiography, and we statistically evaluated the relationship between the stagnation rates in the nidus and the reduction rates. The stagnation rates in the nidus prior to linac-based stereotactic radiosurgery were positively correlated with the reduction ratios of AVMs after stereotactic radiosurgery (r = 0.406, p = 0.0432). Our study suggested that a higher stagnation rate in the nidus of the AVM might be obliterated faster after linac-based stereotactic radiosurgery. Thus, calculation of the stagnation rate in the nidus before stereotactic radiosurgery is useful in predicting the efficacy of therapeutic response to linac-based stereotactic radiosurgery for AVMs.",1999 Mar,1999,Nihon Igaku Hoshasen Gakkai zasshi.

23205798,High-precision volume-staged Gamma Knife surgery and equivalent hypofractionation dose schedules for treating large arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECT: The goal of this study was to develop a technique for performing submillimeter high-precision volume-staged Gamma Knife surgery and investigate its potential benefits in comparison with hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) for treating large arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). METHODS: The authors analyzed 7 pediatric AVM cases treated with volume-staged stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) using the Gamma Knife Perfexion at the University of California, San Francisco. The target and normal tissue contours from each case were exported for hypofractionated treatment planning based on the Gamma Knife Extend system or the CyberKnife SRT. Both the Gamma Knife Extend and CyberKnife treatment plans were matched to yield the same level of target coverage (95%-98%) and conformity indices (1.24-1.46). Finally, hypofractionated treatment plans were compared with volume-staged treatment plans for sparing normal brain by using biologically equivalent 12-Gy normal brain volumes. RESULTS: Hypofractionated Gamma Knife Extend and CyberKnife treatment plans exhibited practically identical sparing of normal brain for the studied cases. However, when matching such values with volume-staged treatments for the biological effective dose, only conservative dose fractionation schemes, such as 27.3 Gy in 5 fractions and 25 Gy in 4 fractions, were found to be comparable to the volume-staged treatments. On average, this represents a mean 18.7% ± 7.3% reduction in the single-fraction biologically equivalent dose for hypofractionated treatments versus the reference volume-staged treatments (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Volume staging remains advantageous over hypofractionation in delivering a higher dose to the target and for better sparing of normal brain tissue in the treatment of large AVMs. More clinical data are needed, however, to justify the clinical superiority of this increased dose when compared with a hypofractionated treatment regimen.",2012 Dec,2012,Journal of neurosurgery,117 Suppl,,115-9,eng,False,10.3171/2012.7.GKS121023;10.3171/2012.7.GKS121023,Journal Article,"Brain/pathology/*surgery;Child;Dose Fractionation, Radiation;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/pathology/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Radiosurgery/*instrumentation/methods;Treatment Outcome",,False,0.13450404807302646,True
28323878,Microsurgery for intracranial arteriovenous malformation: Long-term outcomes in 445 patients.,"BACKGROUND: The management of intracranial arteriovenous malformations(AVMs) poses challenges to the cerebrovascular specialists. OBJECTIVE: To review the long-term outcomes of intracranial AVMs treated with microsurgical resections. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 445 patients with intracranial AVMs treated in our hospital from January 1st, 2008 to December 31st, 2014. The extracted data included demographic characteristics, clinical presentations, Spetzler-Martin (SM) grades, Supplemented Spetzler-Martin (SM-Supp) Grades, treatment modalities, long-term outcomes, and obliteration rates. Outcome was assessed with a post-operative modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at the last follow-up visit. RESULTS: Of the 445 patients treated with microsurgery, 298 (67.0%) patients initially presented with hemorrhage. Based on the SM grading system, the patients were graded as follows: 83(18.6%) Grade I, 156(35.1%) Grade II, 132(29.7%) Grade III, 61(13.7%) Grade IV and 13(2.9%) Grade V. Overall, 344(77.3%) patients had a favorable outcome (mRS score of 0-2). The favorable outcome for Grade I and II were 92.8% and 85.9%, respectively, sharply reducing to 52.5% in patients with Grade IV and 15.4% in patients with Grade V AVMs. 388(87.2%) patients achieved complete obliteration of the AVMs. 63(14.2%) patients experienced recurrent hemorrhage, and the frequency of rehemorrhage was highest in Grade V patients (77.0%), dropping to 3.6% and 3.8% in patients with Grade I and II lesions, respectively. Permanent neurological deficits occurred in 66(14.8%) patients and death in 35(7.9%) patients. There was no difference of AUROC values between SM grading system and SM-supp grading system (0.726 and 0.734, respectively, p = .715). CONCLUSION: The Spetzler-Martin grading system is a simple and effective method to estimate the risk of surgery and to evaluate the prognosis. Microsurgical resection for AVMs depends on the SM grades, and the morbidity-mortality rate increases with an increasing SM grade.",2017,2017,PloS one,12,3,e0174325,eng,False,10.1371/journal.pone.0174325;e0174325;PONE-D-16-36302;10.1371/journal.pone.0174325,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Child;Child, Preschool;Combined Modality Therapy/*methods;Embolization, Therapeutic/methods;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Hemorrhage/physiopathology/surgery;Humans;Infant;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*mortality/*surgery;Male;Microsurgery/*methods;Middle Aged;Neurosurgical Procedures/*methods;Radiosurgery/methods;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",,True,0.5379597752027132,False

20561494,Diagnosis and management of arteriovenous malformations in children.,"Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is the most common cause of spontaneous intraparenchymal hemorrhage in children, excluding hemorrhages of prematurity and early infancy. Because most children diagnosed with an AVM undergo initial treatment emergently, the natural history of AVMs in the pediatric population is not well understood. Most pediatric AVMs do not come to clinical attention unless they hemorrhage. Therefore, their optimal management remains controversial. Children with intracranial AVMs represent a special challenge in that they harbor unacceptable lifelong risks of hemorrhage and potential neurologic deficits. Patients should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine the best multidisciplinary treatment regimen that can be used to preserve neurologic function and eradicate the AVM with the lowest risk of mortality. Successful treatment depends on the location and size of the AVM, its hemodynamic properties, the clinical condition of the patient, and the treatment modality selected. The armamentarium for AVM management has grown with technological advances and now includes microsurgical resection, endovascular embolization, radiosurgery, or any combination of these modalities. Microsurgical resection remains the gold standard for treatment of accessible pediatric AVMs, especially in cases that present with intracranial hemorrhage. Newer modalities, such as embolization and radiosurgery, have provided additional tools to help children with large or deep-seated lesions that would be deemed unresectable with microsurgical techniques alone. Long-term follow-up with repeated diagnostic imaging is important despite complete obliteration of the lesion to rule out the small possibility of AVM recurrence.",2010 Jul,2010,Neurosurgery clinics of North America,21,3,443-56,eng,False,10.1016/j.nec.2010.03.012;S1042-3680(10)00034-3;10.1016/j.nec.2010.03.012,Journal Article;Review,"Central Nervous System Vascular Malformations/*diagnosis/physiopathology/*therapy;Cerebral Arteries/*abnormalities/physiopathology/surgery;Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology/pathology/physiopathology;Cerebral Veins/*abnormalities/pathology/physiopathology;Child;Embolization, Therapeutic/methods/standards;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnosis/physiopathology/*therapy;Neurosurgical Procedures/methods/standards;Radiosurgery/methods/standards;Vascular Surgical Procedures/methods/standards",,False,0.04797468479551617,True

Treatment options for AVMs include microsurgical resection, stereotactic radiosurgery, and endovascular embolization. As endovascular technology and techniques continue to advance and mature, endovascular embolization is becoming an increasingly vital component of AVM treatment not only as a presurgical treatment to reduce microsurgical risks, but also as a stand-alone curative method in some cases.

36245099,Clinical Characteristics and Multimodality Therapy Outcomes in 304 Pediatric Patients with Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformations.,"BACKGROUND: Clinical follow-up data of pediatric patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are limited. This study investigated the characteristics of AVMs in children and analyzed the clinical outcomes of multimodality therapy in pediatric patients with AVMs at a single center. METHODS: This retrospective study included consecutive patients diagnosed with AVMs at our institution between August 2008 and June 2018. Data on demographic characteristics, AVM features, and clinical outcomes were collected. Patients aged <18 years at admission were defined as children. RESULTS: Overall, 1009 patients with AVMs were included, with 304 (30.1%) patients aged <18 years. AVMs in pediatric patients were more likely to present with intracranial hemorrhage, mostly located in deep areas of the brain. A small nidus, exclusively deep drainage, and deep AVM location were associated with hemorrhage in children; Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients with ruptured AVMs had a higher risk of developing a follow-up hemorrhage than those with unruptured AVMs. Among 290 children who were followed up, the multivariate regression analysis showed that a higher pretreatment modified Rankin Scale score, deep AVM location, and conservative treatment were significantly associated with unfavorable outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric patients, AVMs were more likely to present with intracranial hemorrhage than that in adults. Hemorrhagic presentation in children was associated with a small nidus, exclusively deep drainage, and deep AVM location. Pediatric patients with ruptured AVMs had significantly higher risks of follow-up hemorrhage than those with unruptured AVMs. Our clinical results suggest that nonconservative treatment is better for pediatric patients with AVMs.",2022 Dec,2022,World neurosurgery,168,,e150-e161,eng,False,S1878-8750(22)01341-9;10.1016/j.wneu.2022.09.064;S1878-8750(22)01341-9;10.1016/j.wneu.2022.09.064,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Adult;Child;Humans;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/therapy;Intracranial Hemorrhages/epidemiology/etiology/therapy;Kaplan-Meier Estimate;*Radiosurgery/methods,Cerebral arteriovenous malformations;Clinical outcome;Intracranial hemorrhage;Multimodality therapy;Pediatrics,False,0.22185315858391177,True
39266257,DSA Quantitative Analysis and Predictive Modeling of Obliteration in Cerebral AVM following Stereotactic Radiosurgery.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stereotactic radiosurgery is a key treatment modality for cerebral AVMs, particularly for small lesions and those located in eloquent brain regions. Predicting obliteration remains challenging due to evolving treatment paradigms and complex AVM presentations. With digital subtraction angiography (DSA) being the gold standard for outcome evaluation, radiomic approaches offer potential for more objective and detailed analysis. We aimed to develop machine learning modeling using DSA quantitative features for post-SRS obliteration prediction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective registry of patients with cerebral AVMs was screened to include patients with digital prestereotactic radiosurgery DSA. Anterior-posterior and lateral views were retrieved and manually segmented. Quantitative features were computed from the lesion ROI. Following feature selection, machine learning models were developed to predict unsuccessful 2-year total obliteration using processed radiomics features in comparison with clinical and radiosurgical features. When we evaluated through area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), accuracy, area under the precision-recall curve F1, recall, and precision, the best performing model predictions on the test set were interpreted using the Shapley additive explanations approach. RESULTS: DSA images of 100 included patients were retrieved and analyzed. The best-performing clinical radiosurgical model was a gradient boosting classifier with an AUROC of 68% and a recall of 67%. When we used radiomics variables as input, the AdaBoost classifier had the best evaluation metrics with an AUROC of 79% and a recall of 75%. The most important clinico-radiosurgical features, ranked by model contribution, were lesion volume, patient age, treatment dose rate, the presence of seizure at presentation, and prior resection. The most important ranked radiomics features were the following: gray-level size zone matrix, gray-level nonuniformity, kurtosis, sphericity, skewness, and gray-level dependence matrix dependence nonuniformity. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of radiomics with machine learning is a promising approach for predicting cerebral AVM obliteration status following stereotactic radiosurgery. DSA could enhance prognostication of stereotactic radiosurgery-treated AVMs due to its high spatial resolution. Model interpretation is essential for building transparent models and establishing clinically valid radiomic signatures.",2024 Oct 3,2024,AJNR.

25955806,The long-term outcomes of radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations in pediatric and adolescent populations.,"OBJECT Although stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has been accepted as a therapeutic option for arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in children and adolescents, substantial data are still lacking regarding the outcomes of SRS for AVMs in this age group, especially long-term complications. This study aimed to clarify the long-term outcomes of SRS for the treatment of AVM in pediatric patients aged ≤ 18 years. METHODS Outcomes of 116 patients who were aged 4-18 years when they underwent SRS between 1990 and 2009 at the study institute were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS The median follow-up period after SRS was 100 months, with 6 patients followed up for more than 20 years. Actuarial obliteration rates at 3 and 5 years after SRS were 68% and 88%, respectively. Five hemorrhages occurred in 851 patient-years of follow-up. The annual bleeding rate after SRS before obliteration was calculated as 1.3%, which decreased to 0.2% after obliteration. Shorter maximum nidus diameter (p = 0.02) and higher margin dose (p = 0.03) were associated with a higher obliteration rate. Ten patients experienced adverse events after SRS. Of them, 4 patients presented with delayed complications years after SRS (range 9-20 years after SRS). CONCLUSIONS SRS can reduce the risk of hemorrhage in pediatric and adolescent AVMs, with an acceptable risk of complications in the long term. However, adverse events such as expanding hematoma and radiation necrosis that can occur after substantial follow-up should be taken into account at the time that treatment decisions are made and informed consent is obtained.",2015 Aug,2015,Journal of neurosurgery.

36702500,Radiation-Induced Changes Associated with Obliteration of Brain AVMs after Repeat Radiosurgery.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Radiation-induced changes can occur after stereotactic radiosurgery for brain AVMs, potentially causing symptomatic complications. We evaluated the incidence of such changes and the efficacy of repeat gamma knife radiosurgery for incompletely obliterated AVMs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 150 patients who underwent gamma knife radiosurgery for AVMs between 2002 and 2020; twenty-five underwent further radiosurgical procedures for incompletely obliterated AVMs. We recorded the median margin doses at the first (median, 20 Gy; range, 12-23 Gy; AVM volume, 0.026-31.3 mL) and subsequent procedures (median, 18 Gy; range, 12-23 Gy; AVM volume, 0.048-9.2 mL). RESULTS: After the first treatment, radiologic radiation-induced changes developed in 48 (32%) patients, eight of whom had symptomatic changes. After repeat gamma knife radiosurgery, 16 of 25 patients achieved complete AVM obliteration (64%). The development of radiation-induced changes after the first treatment was significantly associated with successful obliteration by subsequent radiosurgery (OR = 24.0, 95% CI 1.20-483, P = .007). Radiation-induced changes occurred in only 5 (20%) patients who underwent a second gamma knife radiosurgery, one of whom experienced transient neurologic deficits. Between the first and repeat gamma knife radiosurgery procedures, there was no significant difference in radiologic and symptomatic radiation-induced changes (P = .35 and P = 1.0, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Radiation-induced changes after the first gamma knife radiosurgery were associated with AVM obliteration after a repeat procedure. The risk of symptomatic radiation-induced changes did not increase with retreatment. When the first procedure fails to achieve complete AVM obliteration, a favorable outcome can be achieved by a repeat gamma knife radiosurgery, even if radiation-induced changes occur after the first treatment.",2023 Feb,2023,AJNR.

7815144,Linear accelerator radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations: the relationship of size to outcome.,"Between May, 1988 and August, 1993, 158 patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) were treated radiosurgically at the University of Florida. A mean dose of 1560 cGy was directed to the periphery of the lesions, which had a mean volume of 9 cc (0.5 to 45.3 cc). One hundred thirty-nine of these individuals were treated with one isocenter. The mean follow-up interval was 33 months with clinical information available on 153 of these patients. Patients were followed until magnetic resonance (MR) studies suggested complete AVM thrombosis. An arteriogram was then performed, if possible, to verify occlusion status. If arteriography revealed any persistent nidus at 36 months posttreatment, the residual nidus was re-treated. Outcome categories of AVMs analyzed included the following possibilities: 1) angiographic cure; 2) angiographic failure; 3) re-treatment; 4) MR image suggested cure; 5) MR image suggested failure; 6) patient refused follow-up evaluation; 7) patient lost to follow-up study; or 8) patient deceased. The endpoints for success or failure of radiosurgery were as follows: angiographic occlusion (success), re-treatment (failure), and death due to AVM hemorrhage (failure). Fifty-six patients in this series reached one of the endpoints. Successful endpoints were seen in 91% of AVMs between 1 and 4 cc in volume, 100% of AVMs 4 to 10 cc in volume, and 79% of AVMs greater than 10 cc in volume. The more traditional measure of radiosurgical success, percentage of angiograms showing complete obliteration, was obtained in 81% of AVMs between 1 and 4 cc in volume, 89% of AVMs between 4 and 10 cc in volume, and 69% of AVMs greater than 10 cc in volume. A detailed analysis of the relationship of all outcome categories to size is presented.",1995 Feb,1995,Journal of neurosurgery,82,2,180-9,eng,False,10.3171/jns.1995.82.2.0180,Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/pathology/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects;Treatment Failure;Treatment Outcome,,True,0.5071635452927942,False
22910397,Vascular complications of stereotactic radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVE: Although vasculopathy and de novo aneurysm formation are known complications of traditional radiation therapy, their occurrence following AVM SRS is rare and thus infrequently addressed in the literature. We sought to evaluate these phenomena through a review of our institutional experience. METHODS: Our review afforded 32 patients treated with LINAC-based SRS over an eight year period. We noted obliteration rates, complication rates and long-term outcomes, with particular attention paid to follow-up angiographic studies. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 4.3 years, the overall obliteration rate was 50%, increasing to 87% for AVMs less than 3cm. Eight patients had nine hemorrhages following SRS (25%). One occurred in the context of a de novo arterial pseudoaneurysm and another in the context of a new venous varix. Two patients with post-SRS hemorrhage had intranidal aneurysms that were not as apparent on initial angiography. Two patients that did not suffer from latency period hemorrhage developed dysplastic changes of feeding arteries, and one patient suffered from early venous thrombosis with resultant permanent hemiparesis from infarction. After a mean follow-up of 4.3 years, 8 patients were clinically improved (25%), 19 were the same (59%), and 5 were worse (16%), including 2 that died as a result of latency period hemorrhage. CONCLUSION: While radiosurgery of AVMs is safe and successful in the vast majority of cases, vasculopathic complications including de novo aneurysm and varix development, early venous occlusion and stenotic vasculopathy, while infrequent, can occur. Closer long-term angiographic surveillance of these patients may thus be warranted.",2013 Jun,2013,Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,115,6,713-7,eng,False,S0303-8467(12)00433-7;10.1016/j.clineuro.2012.08.008;S0303-8467(12)00433-7;10.1016/j.clineuro.2012.08.008,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Cerebral Angiography;Cerebrovascular Disorders/*etiology/*therapy;Child;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Intracranial Hemorrhages/etiology;Male;Postoperative Complications/*therapy;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects/methods;Tomography, X-Ray Computed;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",,True,0.5506561595272937,False
18283398,Radiosurgery of brain arteriovenous malformations in children.,"OBJECTIVE: The authors describe their experience in treating 22 children with a single brain arteriovenous malformation (bAVM) using a dedicated LINAC stereotactic radiosurgery unit. METHODS: The findings of 22 consecutive patients < or = 18 years of age who underwent radiosurgery for a single bAVM and with at least 24 months of follow-up, or earlier proven obliteration,were reviewed. The median age at radiosurgery was 13.8 years,with a hemorrhagic presentation in 86%. Median bAVM-volume was 1.8 ml, with a median prescribed marginal dose of 19.0 Gy. RESULTS: The crude complete obliteration-rate was 68% (n = 15) after a median follow-up of 24 months. The actuarial obliteration- rate was 45 % after two years and 64 % after three years. Patients with a radiosurgery-based AVM score < or = 1 more frequently had an excellent outcome than patients with a bAVM score > 1 (71% vs. 20%, P = 0.12), as well as an increased obliteration rate (P = 0.03) One patient died from a bAVM-related hemorrhage 27 months after radiosurgery, representing a postradiosurgery hemorrhage rate of 1.3%/year for the complete followup interval. Overall outcome was good to excellent in 68% (n = 15). Radiation-induced changes on MR imaging were seen in 36% (n = 8) after a median interval of 12.5 months, resulting in deterioration of pre-existing neurological symptoms in one patient. CONCLUSIONS: Radiosurgery is a relatively effective, minimally invasive treatment for small bAVMs in children. The rebleeding rate is low, provided that known predilection places for bleeding had been endovascularly eliminated.Our overall results compare unfavourably to recent pediatric microsurgical series, although comparison between series remains imprecise. Nevertheless, when treatment is indicated in a child with a bAVM that is amenable to both microsurgery or radiosurgery, microsurgery should carefully be advocated over radiosurgery, because of its immediate risk reduction.",2008 Apr,2008,Journal of neurology,255,4,551-60,eng,False,10.1007/s00415-008-0739-4;10.1007/s00415-008-0739-4,Journal Article,Adolescent;Age Factors;Brain/blood supply/physiopathology/surgery;Cerebral Angiography;Cerebral Arteries/*abnormalities/diagnostic imaging/*radiation effects;Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology/physiopathology/surgery;Child;Cohort Studies;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/pathology/physiopathology/*surgery;Male;Postoperative Hemorrhage/mortality;Radiosurgery/adverse effects/*methods/*statistics & numerical data;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome,,True,0.7581708635121329,False
26548816,Angioarchitecture and Posttreatment Magnetic Resonance Imaging Characteristics of Brain Arteriovenous Malformations and Long-Term Seizure Control After Radiosurgery.,"OBJECTIVE: To corroborate which pretreatment angioarchitectural characteristics and posttreatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features were associated with better seizure and antiepileptic drug outcomes in patients with brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) treated by Gamma Knife radiosurgery. METHODS: During the period 2007-2010, 220 patients with intracranial AVMs undergoing radiosurgery at our hospital were evaluated. Imaging features on digital subtraction angiography and follow-up MRI, medical records, and direct patient interview were retrospectively assessed. Seizure outcome was assessed using the Engel classification and the status of antiepileptic drug use. RESULTS: At the last follow-up, 21 of 31 patients (68%) who met the recruitment criteria had AVM obliteration on digital subtraction angiography or MRI. Seizure-free status (Engel class 1) was achieved in 20 patients (65%), and 13 of 20 (65%) seizure-free patients were medication-free. The presence of total obliteration at last imaging follow-up (P = 0.013), absent retrograde cortical veins on digital subtraction angiography before GKRS (P = 0.013), nidus <3.7 cm (P = 0.006), and lower modified radiosurgery-based AVM score (P = 0.026) were significant predictors of seizure-free outcome. The strongest independent predictor of seizure-free status was absence of retrograde veins (odds ratio = 9.9). No angioarchitectural feature, postradiosurgery imaging finding on MRI, or radiosurgical treatment parameter was a significant predictor of seizure control or cessation of medication in seizure-free patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that radiosurgery provides favorable outcomes in patients with AVM-related epilepsy. Patients with intracranial AVMs can benefit from seizure control after GKRS before undergoing AVM obliteration.

8622164,Chronic encapsulated expanding hematoma in association with gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery for a cerebral arteriovenous malformation. Case report.,"The authors report a rare case of a patient with a chronic encapsulated expanding hematoma and progressive neurological deterioration who presented 2 years after gamma knife radiosurgery for a cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM). A tough capsule containing multiple layers of organized hematoma resulting from previous bleeding was confirmed surgically. Histological examination revealed that the capsule consisted of a dense collagenous outer layer and a granulomatous newly vascularized inner layer with marked fibrosis. Hemosiderin deposits were frequently observed in the inner layer, which suggested recurrent minor bleeding from fragile vessels in this layer. An AVM was found in the hematoma, which had degenerated as the result of radiosurgery. A cross-section of the abnormal vessels showed various stages of obliteration due to intimal hypertrophy. The clinical course, radiological features, and histological findings in this case were compatible with those of previously reported chronic encapsulated hematomas. A possible mechanism of hematoma formation and its expansion are discussed.",1996 May,1996,Journal of neurosurgery,84,5,874-8,eng,False,10.3171/jns.1996.84.5.0874,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Adult;Brain Diseases/*complications;Hematoma/*complications/*surgery;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/*surgery;Male;Prognosis;Radiosurgery;Tomography, X-Ray Computed",,False,0.07655140285783364,True
9032869,Dynamic and static scintigraphic evaluation of cerebral arteriovenous malformations to evaluate radiosurgical treatment.,"The radiobiologic changes induced by cobalt-60 gamma irradiation in cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is a torpid process. Complete obliteration may take 1 or 2 years or even longer. Neuroradiological modalities like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) do not provide sufficient information to comprehend this process. Digital subtraction angiography represents an invasive method and is therefore most often performed when complete obliteration is expected. The purpose of this study was to investigate the value of blood pool scintigraphy and functional imaging, such as single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), to gain more knowledge about the volumetric changes of AVMs treated by radiosurgery. Twenty consecutive candidates for Gamma Knife treatment were selected for comparative MRI/ MRA and scintigraphic studies. All lesions ranging from 0.6 to 18.6 cm3 could be identified on blood pool and SPECT images. Seven patients had repetitive examinations at 3-month intervals to compare the relative volumetric change of the lesion. In 5 cases, a marked decrease in blood pooling was noticed after 3 months, and in 2 patients no significant change was evident. In contrast, MRI/MRA scans done at the same time did not similarly indicate progressive obliteration changes. This preliminary result indicates that scintigraphic evaluation using the blood pool technique is a very sensitive method to describe the relative volumetric change of radiosurgically treated AVMs.",1996,1996,Stereotactic and functional neurosurgery,66 Suppl 1,,269-77,eng,False,10.1159/000099818,Clinical Trial;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Evaluation Studies as Topic;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Gamma Rays;Gated Blood-Pool Imaging;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;*Radiosurgery;Technetium;Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon",,False,0.09712572974318383,True

36549849,Artificial Intelligence-Assisted Evaluation of the Spatial Relationship between Brain Arteriovenous Malformations and the Corticospinal Tract to Predict Postsurgical Motor Defects.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Preoperative evaluation of brain AVMs is crucial for the selection of surgical candidates. Our goal was to use artificial intelligence to predict postsurgical motor defects in patients with brain AVMs involving motor-related areas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-three patients who underwent microsurgical resection of brain AVMs involving motor-related areas were retrospectively reviewed. Four artificial intelligence-based indicators were calculated with artificial intelligence on TOF-MRA and DTI, including FN(5mm/50mm) (the proportion of fiber numbers within 5-50mm from the lesion border), FN(10mm/50mm) (the same but within 10-50mm), FP(5mm/50mm) (the proportion of fiber voxel points within 5-50mm from the lesion border), and FP(10mm/50mm) (the same but within 10-50mm). The association between the variables and long-term postsurgical motor defects was analyzed using univariate and multivariate analyses. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression with the Pearson correlation coefficient was used to select the optimal features to develop the machine learning model to predict postsurgical motor defects. The area under the curve was calculated to evaluate the predictive performance. RESULTS: In patients with and without postsurgical motor defects, the mean FN(5mm/50mm), FN(10mm/50mm), FP(5mm/50mm), and FP(10mm/50mm) were 0.24 (SD, 0.24) and 0.03 (SD, 0.06), 0.37 (SD, 0.27) and 0.06 (SD, 0.08), 0.06 (SD, 0.10) and 0.01 (SD, 0.02), and 0.10 (SD, 0.12) and 0.02 (SD, 0.05), respectively. Univariate and multivariate logistic analyses identified FN(10mm/50mm) as an independent risk factor for long-term postsurgical motor defects (P = .002). FN(10mm/50mm) achieved a mean area under the curve of 0.86 (SD, 0.08). The mean area under the curve of the machine learning model consisting of FN(10mm/50mm), diffuseness, and the Spetzler-Martin score was 0.88 (SD, 0.07). CONCLUSIONS: The artificial intelligence-based indicator, FN(10mm/50mm), can reflect the lesion-fiber spatial relationship and act as a dominant predictor for postsurgical motor defects in patients with brain AVMs involving motor-related areas.",2023 Jan,2023,AJNR.

20670559,Efficacy of diluted NBCA mixture for embolization of arteriovenous malformations.,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and problems of the embolization for cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) with diluted cyanoacrylate adhesives. Twelve consecutive AVM cases were treated with N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (NBCA) glues between January 1997 and July 1998. The mean age of the patients was 37 years old. Intracerebral hemorrhage was the presenting symptom in seven cases, seizure in three, headache in one and mental deterioration in one. According to the classification of Spetzler and Martin, seven were Grade II, five were Grade III. We used a mixture of NBCA (normally 25% Histoacryl, 75% Ethidol) for embolization. Microcatheter was navigated into the nidus and the tip of the catheter was set in a wedged position. Then the glue was injected using complete column technique. Nineteen sessions of embolization were performed in 12 patients. The mean volume of each nidus was reduced from 22.5 ml to 3.4 ml (85%) after embolization. Four cases were cured by embolization alone. Surgical resection was performed after embolization without any residual nidus in three cases. Five were treated with stereotactic radiosurgery following embolization. One was completely cured in 18 months after and the other four have been decreasing their sizes of nidus. One case was suffered from delayed intracerebral hemorrhage three days after embolization, and resulted in mild hemiparesis and memory disturbance. The others had no complications and were clinically improved or unchanged after embolization. It is possible to embolize the nidus of AVMs more accurately and safely with diluted mixture of NBCA, compared with the method using relatively higher concentration of NBCA glues. This technique is useful and effective method for the treatment of AVMs.",1999 Nov,1999,"Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology,",5 Suppl 1,,161-5,eng,False,IN.v5.suppl;10.1177/15910199990050S129,Journal Article,,,False,0.15722077599596723,True

METHODS: We analyzed 236 patients with AVM treated between June 1990 and February 1994. The patients consisted of 137 men and 99 women, and ranged in age from 4 to 71 years. AVM volume ranged 0.7 to 37.7 ml. Maximum and peripheral doses ranged from 18.2 to 60.0 Gy and 10.0 to 28.0 Gy, respectively. RESULTS: Complete obliteration rates at 1,2, and 3 years were 36.2, 68.9, and 86.6%, respectively. The mean time to complete obliteration was 21.4 months. Univariated analysis revealed that calculated target volume, peripheral dose, peripheral percent dose and treatment optimality were significant factors for complete obliteration. In multivariate analysis, calculated target volume, treatment optimality, and CT-based planning were significant factors. The actuarial risk of post-radiosurgical brain edema at 2 years was 20.0%. In both univariate and multivariate analysis, calculated target volume was the only significant factor. Symptomatic complications developed in 10.0% of patients at 2 years, but no significant factors were identified. Permanent complications and severe neurological deficits were seen in 4.4 and 2.8% of patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results were similar to those reported previously.

25875580,Effect of Prior Embolization on Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformation Radiosurgery Outcomes: A Case-Control Study.,"BACKGROUND: Embolization before stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM) has been shown to negatively affect obliteration rates, but its impact on the risks of radiosurgery-induced complications and latency period hemorrhage is poorly defined. OBJECTIVE: To determine, in a case-control study, the effect of prior embolization on AVM SRS outcomes. METHODS: We evaluated a database of AVM patients who underwent SRS. Propensity score analysis was used to match the case (embolized nidi) and control (nonembolized nidi) cohorts. AVM angioarchitectural complexity was defined as the sum of the number of major feeding arteries and draining veins to the nidus. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed on the overall study population to determine independent predictors of obliteration and radiation-induced changes. RESULTS: The matching process yielded 242 patients in each cohort. The actuarial obliteration rates were significantly lower in the embolized (31%, 49% at 5, 10 years, respectively) compared with the nonembolized (48%, 64% at 5, 10 years, respectively) cohort (P = .003). In the multivariate analysis for obliteration, lower angioarchitectural complexity (P < .001) and radiologically evident radiation-induced changes (P = .016) were independent predictors, but embolization was not significant (P = .744). In the multivariate analysis for radiologic radiation-induced changes, lack of prior embolization (P = .009) and fewer draining veins (P = .011) were independent predictors. CONCLUSION: The effect of prior embolization on AVM obliteration after SRS may be significantly confounded by nidus angioarchitectural complexity. Additionally, embolization could reduce the risk of radiation-induced changes. Thus, combined embolization and SRS may be warranted for appropriately selected nidi.",2015 Sep,2015,Neurosurgery,77,3,406-17; discussion 417,eng,True,10.1227/NEU.0000000000000772;10.1227/NEU.0000000000000772,Journal Article,"Adult;Case-Control Studies;Databases, Factual;*Embolization, Therapeutic;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;*Radiosurgery;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",,True,0.8754816068049124,True
26090838,Pathological response of cavernous malformations following radiosurgery.,"OBJECT: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a therapeutic option for repeatedly hemorrhagic cavernous malformations (CMs) located in areas deemed to be high risk for resection. During the latency period of 2 or more years after SRS, recurrent hemorrhage remains a persistent risk until the obliterative process has finished. The pathological response to SRS has been studied in relatively few patients. The authors of the present study aimed to gain insight into the effect of SRS on CM and to propose possible mechanisms leading to recurrent hemorrhages following SRS. METHODS: During a 13-year interval between 2001 and 2013, bleeding recurred in 9 patients with CMs that had been treated using Gamma Knife surgery at the authors' institution. Microsurgical removal was subsequently performed in 5 of these patients, who had recurrent hemorrhages between 4 months and 7 years after SRS. Specimens from 4 patients were available for analysis and used for this report. RESULTS: Histopathological analysis demonstrated that vascular sclerosis develops as early as 4 months after SRS. In the samples from 2 to 7 years after SRS, sclerotic vessels were prominent, but there were also vessels with incomplete sclerosis as well as some foci of neovascularization. CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent bleeding after SRS for CM could be related to incomplete sclerosis of the vessels, but neovascularization may also play a role.",2015 Oct,2015,Journal of neurosurgery,123,4,938-44,eng,False,10.3171/2014.10.JNS14499;10.3171/2014.10.JNS14499,Case Reports;Clinical Study;Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/*pathology/*surgery;Intracranial Hemorrhages/etiology/surgery;Male;Middle Aged;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult,AVM = arteriovenous malformation;CM = cavernous malformation;MMP-9 = matrix metallopeptidase 9;SRS = stereotactic radiosurgery;VEGF = vascular endothelial growth factor;bFGF = basic fibroblast growth factor;brain hemorrhage;cavernous malformation;stereotactic radiosurgery,False,0.09820220813517318,True

33863526,A case of delayed cyst formation post brain AVM stereotactic radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformation: Case report.,"Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are a rare cause of cerebrovascular abnormality with incidence of about 1 in 100,000 people per year and point prevalence of about 0.2%. AVMs are associated with serious complications such as intracranial haemorrhage (2-4% a year, 16% and 29% at 10 and 20 years after diagnosis), seizures (10-30%), focal neurologic deficits, and headaches. The management options are surveillance, endovascular embolization, microsurgical excision and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). In SRS Stereotactically focused high energy beams of photons induce progressive thrombosis by fibro-intimal hyperplasia and subsequent luminal obliteration. These changes usually take one to three years known as ""latency period"". Complications are reported in 8% of patients undergoing SRS, including radiographic parenchymal lesions, cranial nerve deficits, seizures, headaches, and cyst formation. Cyst formation is reported in about 1.2 % of patients undergoing SRS. While the exact mechanism of post SRS cyst formation is unclear, it is hypothesized that it might be due to damage to the blood brain barrier and increased vessel wall permeability. Delayed cyst formation is reported with latency period between 3 and 10 years after radiotherapy for treatment of cerebrovascular AVMs. However, cystic formation with longer latency periods (in one case upto 17 years) after radiotherapy for other causes such as nasopharyngeal cancers have been reported.

The technique allows the precise treatment of small targets through the use of stereotactic techniques. The ability to accurately focus and target tissues with both patient and gantry movements allows the production of sharp dose gradients. This permits large target doses and allows for the sparing of critical tissues which may only lie a few millimeters from the edge of the target volume. In order to carry out this technique, routine radiotherapy simulation and treatment planning must be replaced by virtual simulation and non-coplanar treatment planning.

9055280,Prediction of obliteration after gamma knife surgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVE: To define the factors of importance for the obliteration of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), thus making a prediction of the probability for obliteration possible. METHODS: In 945 AVMs of a series of 1319 patients treated with the gamma knife during 1970 to 1990, the relationship between patient, AVMs, and treatment parameters on the one hand and the obliteration of the nidus on the other was analyzed. RESULTS: The obliteration rate increased both with increased minimum (lowest periphery) and average dose and decreased with increased AVM volume. The minimum dose to the AVMs was the decisive dose factor for the treatment result. The higher the minimum dose, the higher the chance for total obliteration. The curve illustrating this relation increased logarithmically to a value of 87%. A higher average dose shortened the latency to AVM obliteration. For the obliterated cases, the larger the malformation, the lower the minimum dose used. This prompted us to relate the obliteration rate to the product minimum dose (AVM volume)1/3 (K index). The obliteration rate increased linearly with the K index up to a value of approximately 27, and for higher K values, the obliteration rate had a constant value of approximately 80%. For the group of 273 cases treated with a minimum dose of at least 25 Gy, the obliteration rate at the study end point (defined as 2-yr latency) was 80% (95% confidence interval = 75-85%). If obliterations that occurred beyond the end point are included, the obliteration rate increased to 85% (81-89%). CONCLUSION: The probability of obliteration of AVMs after gamma knife surgery is related both to the lowest dose to the AVMs and the AVM volume, and it can be predicted using the K index.",1997 Mar,1997,Neurosurgery,40,3,425-30; discussion 430-1,eng,False,10.1097/00006123-199703000-00001,Comparative Study;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Angiography, Digital Subtraction;Cerebral Angiography;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnostic imaging;Male;Postoperative Complications/diagnostic imaging;Radiosurgery/*methods;Treatment Outcome",,True,0.5041191734939137,False

39377594,Headache and Visual Aura Outcomes After Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Patients With Occipital Lobe Arteriovenous Malformations: A Single-Center Retrospective Cohort Study.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Patients with brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVMs) sometimes experience migraine-like chronic headaches. Reportedly, this symptom is common in occipital lobe BAVMs; however, the exact prevalence has not been clarified, and the details of visual auras have been scarcely reported. Furthermore, no comprehensive studies exist on the improvement of migraine associated with visual auras in occipital lobe BAVMs after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Therefore, this study investigated the prevalence of headache with visual aura in patients with occipital lobe BAVMs and evaluated the impact of SRS on preexisting symptoms. METHODS: As a single-center retrospective cohort study, a total of 104 patients with occipital lobe BAVMs treated with SRS from 1990 to 2024 were analyzed. Pre-SRS and post-SRS symptoms of headache and visual aura were documented. The outcomes measured were headache severity, frequency, aura characteristics, and BAVM obliteration rates. RESULTS: Of the 104 patients, 41 (39%) reported chronic headache pre-SRS, and 37 (36%) experienced migraine with visual aura. Compared with pre-SRS, 90% (28/31) of the patients experienced a >50% reduction in headache severity and frequency at a median follow-up of 11 months, and 89% (25/28) experienced a >50% reduction in aura frequency. Complete headache remission was achieved in 35% (13/31) of patients. Complete obliteration of BAVMs was confirmed in 75% (76/102) of the patients at a median of 33 months. A smaller nidus volume was associated with both complete headache remission and BAVM obliteration, whereas age and sex were not significant predictors of headache outcome. CONCLUSION: Patients with occipital lobe BAVMs frequently experience migraine-like headaches with visual aura, which may be more prevalent than in the general population. SRS for occipital lobe BAVMs could not only achieve favorable BAVM obliteration with minimal adverse effects but also significantly improve migraine-like symptoms, including visual aura, particularly in patients with smaller nidus volumes.",2024 Oct 8,2024,Neurosurgery,,,,eng,True,10.1227/neu.0000000000003212;00006123-990000000-01383;10.1227/neu.0000000000003212,Journal Article,,,True,0.5717836109683331,True
34333653,Effect of Prior Embolization on Outcomes After Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Pediatric Brain Arteriovenous Malformations: An International Multicenter Study.,"BACKGROUND: Pediatric brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are a significant cause of morbidity but the role of multimodal therapy in the treatment of these lesions is not well understood. OBJECTIVE: To compare the outcomes of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) with and without prior embolization for pediatric AVMs. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the International Radiosurgery Research Foundation pediatric AVM database. AVMs were categorized, based on use of pre-embolization (E + SRS) or lack thereof (SRS-only). Outcomes were compared in unadjusted and inverse probability weight (IPW)-adjusted models. Favorable outcome was defined as obliteration without post-SRS hemorrhage or permanent radiation-induced changes (RIC). RESULTS: The E + SRS and SRS-only cohorts comprised 91 and 448 patients, respectively. In unadjusted models, the SRS-only cohort had higher rates of obliteration (68.5% vs 43.3%, < .001) and favorable outcome (61.2% vs 36.3%, P < .001) but a lower rate of symptomatic RIC (9.0% vs 16.7%, P = .031). The IPW-adjusted rates of every outcome were similar between the 2 cohorts. However, cumulative obliteration rates at 3, 5, 8, and 10 yr remained higher in the absence of prior embolization (46.3%, 64.6%, 72.6%, and 77.4% for SRS-only vs 24.4%, 37.2%, 44.1%, and 48.7% for E + SRS cohorts, respectively; SHR = 0.449 [0.238-0.846], P = .013). CONCLUSION: Embolization appears to decrease cumulative obliteration rates after SRS for pediatric AVMs without affecting the risk of post-treatment hemorrhage or adverse radiation effects arguing against the routine use of pre-SRS embolization. While endovascular therapy can be considered for occlusion of high-risk angioarchitectural features prior to SRS, future studies are necessary to clarify its role.",2021 Sep 15,2021,Neurosurgery,89,4,672-679,eng,False,10.1093/neuros/nyab245;6333248;10.1093/neuros/nyab245,Journal Article;Multicenter Study,Brain;Child;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome,Arteriovenous malformation;Intracranial hemorrhage;Obliteration;Pediatric;Radiosurgery;Vascular malformation,True,0.8099633096898974,False
24564082,Radiosurgical irradiation of patients with cerebral AVM on the Gamma knife.,"Arterio-venous malformation (AVM) of the brain are congenital malformations of cerebral vessels in the embryonic period. Standards in AVM treatment is currently applying the endovascular technique, microneurosurgical removal and stereotactic radiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the period from 2005 to 2011, in 139 patients with arteriovenous malformations of the brain were treated using ""Gamma Knife"". 89 (64%) of 139 patients suffered bleeding in anamnesis. Paroxysmal symptoms of varying severity dominated in the clinical picture of 35 (27%) patients. Previous microsurgical resection was performed in 10 patients. 28 patients experienced a partial embolization of vascular malformations before radiosurgery. A boundary value radiation dose ranged from 18 to 28 Gy (mean dose 20 Gy), day dose was in the range of 40-80% (average 50% isodose). Maximum dose ranged between 18-60 Gy (mean dose of 38 Gy.). RESULTS: Control angiography or spiral CT screening angiography was performed in all 85 patients who were treated with follow-up data for more than two years, showed that total obliteration occurred in 75% of cases. Frequency of symptomatic radiation reactions was less than 5%. After two years or more after treatment, complete obliteration was observed in 74% of patients.

22622226,[Stereotactic intracranial radiotherapy: dose prescription].,"The aim of this article was the study of the successive steps permitting the prescription of dose in stereotactic intracranial radiotherapy, which includes radiosurgery and fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy. The successive steps studied are: the choice of stereotactic intracranial radiotherapy among the therapeutic options, based on curative or palliative treatment intent, then the selection of lesions according to size/volume, pathological type and their number permitting the choice between radiosurgery or fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy, which have the same methodological basis. Clinical experience has determined the level of dose to treat the lesions and limit the irradiation of healthy adjacent tissues and organs at risk structures. The last step is the optimization of the different parameters to obtain a safe compromise between the lesion dose and healthy adjacent structures. Study of dose-volume histograms, coverage indices and 3D imaging permit the optimization of irradiation. For lesions close to or included in a critical area, the prescribed dose is planned using the inverse planification method. Implementation of the successively described steps is mandatory to insure the prescription of an optimized dose. The whole procedure is based on the delineation of the lesion and adjacent healthy tissues. There are sometimes difficulties to assess the delineation and the volume of the target, however improvement of local control rates and reduction of secondary effects are the proof that the totality of the successive procedures are progressively improved.

39179026,A Comprehensive Meta-Analysis on the Efficacy of Stereotactic Radiosurgery versus Surgical Resection for Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformations.,"BACKGROUND: Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) pose significant management challenges, with treatment options such as stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and surgical resection (SR) often debated. This meta-analysis seeks to compare the efficacy and safety of SRS versus SR in treating cerebral AVMs. METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted across multiple databases adhering to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Inclusion criteria encompassed studies comparing SRS and SR with respect to AVM obliteration, hemorrhagic complications, and functional neurological outcomes. Data synthesis involved calculating standardized mean differences (SMD) for continuous variables and risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes, with heterogeneity assessed using the I(2) statistic. RESULTS: Eight studies met the inclusion criteria. SRS was associated with a lower incidence of postoperative embolization (SMD = -6.58; 95% CI: [-9.49, -3.67]; I(2) = 94%). Additionally, SRS demonstrated a reduced risk of postoperative hemorrhage (SMD = -14.45; 95% CI: [-21.58, -7.32]; I(2) = 99%). The analysis also indicated a shorter mean operative time for SRS (SMD = -4.08; 95% CI: [-7.01, -1.16]; I(2) = 94%). Moreover, SRS resulted in fewer postoperative neurologic deficits (SMD = -3.64; 95% CI: [-4.74, -2.55]; I(2) = 90%). CONCLUSIONS: SRS appears to offer several advantages over SR, including lower rates of embolization, hemorrhage, shorter operative times, and fewer neurologic deficits post-treatment.

22294705,Detection of residual brain arteriovenous malformations after radiosurgery: diagnostic accuracy of contrast-enhanced four-dimensional MR angiography at 3.0 T.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of four-dimensional MR angiography (4D-MRA) at 3.0 T for detecting residual arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) after Gamma Knife (Elekta Instrument AB, Stockholm, Sweden) radiosurgery (GKRS). METHODS: We assessed 36 angiographically confirmed AVMs in 36 patients who had been treated with GKRS. 4D-MRA was performed after GKRS and the time intervals were 39.4 ± 26.0 months [mean ± standard deviation (SD)]. 4D-MRA was obtained at 3.0 T after contrast injection, with a measured voxel size of 1 × 1 × 1 mm and a temporal resolution of 1.1 s (13 patients) or a voxel size of 1 × 1 × 2 mm and a temporal resolution of 0.98 s (23 patients). X-ray angiography was performed as the standard reference within 53 ± 47 days (mean ± SD) after MRA. To determine a residual AVM, the 4D-MRA results were independently reviewed by two readers blinded to the X-ray angiography results. We evaluated diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy of 4D-MRA for detection of a residual AVM. RESULTS: A residual AVM was identified in 13 patients (13/36, 36%) on X-ray angiography. According to Readers 1 and 2, 4D-MRA had a sensitivity of 79.6% and 64.3%, a specificity of 90.9% and 100%, a PPV of 84.6% and 100% and an NPV of 90% and 81.5%, respectively, and a diagnostic accuracy of 86.1% for Readers 1 and 2, for detecting residual AVMs after GKRS.

32112802,Brainstem cavernous malformations - no longer a forbidden territory? A systemic review of recent literature.,"BACKGROUND: Due to its eloquent location and potentially devastating neurological consequences, the management of brainstem cavernous malformations (CCMs) attracts considerable debate. There is currently a paucity of Level 1 evidence for their management. The aim of this literature review is to explore the current evidence on the risk-benefit profile of different management options. METHODS: A systemic literature search, following the PRISMA algorithm was performed on publications between 2010 and 2018 using the Pubmed database, with the relevant keywords. Only English articles were included. Articles focusing on spinal CCMs and studies with less than 30 participants were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 222 search results were reviewed and after removal of duplicates and screening of abstracts, 28 clinical papers comprising 30 or more brainstem CCM cases were included in the study. The heterogeneity of the publications precluded a formal meta-analysis of results. The general consensus is that for CCMs presenting with severe symptoms and/or multiple haemorrhages that reach an accessible pial surface, surgery is considered to be the gold-standard treatment, with some authors suggesting the optimal timing to be within two to six weeks of ictus. For those patients with multiple, deep-seated CCM related haemorrhages that do not reach the pial surface, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) can be considered. Conservative treatment is generally considered in incidental cases. Management of brainstem cavernomas of other categories still remains controversial. CONCLUSIONS: Due to their highly eloquent location, brainstem CCMs are challenging lesions to manage. Management must be balanced by the risk-benefit profile and tailored to the individual patients and their treating clinicians.

1729304,Use of MR angiography for stereotactic planning.,"With the introduction of MR angiography (MRA) into clinical routine MR protocols, it has become possible now to image flowing as well as stationary tissue with excellent contrast using a single modality. This has opened up new perspectives for planning stereotactic approaches, which are characterized by high risks for damaging intracerebral vessels or vital brain structures. In this article we present an MRA based planning method for the treatment of arteriovenous malformations by stereotactic radiosurgery. It includes flow compensated gradient echo pulse sequences for the acquisition of angiographic MR datasets, a stereotactic MR marker system, an algorithm for the correction of geometric distortion of MR image data, and a three-dimensional workstation system for the creation and evaluation of treatment plans. The latter is based on the concept of simultaneously displaying both MR slice and angiographic projection images. This allows the evaluation of intracerebral vasculature together with brain anatomy. The MRA guided planning approach was tested and compared to a conventional X-ray angiographic technique in a clinical study. Our satisfactory results suggest that MRA is a technique that can be used advantageously for stereotactic planning.",1992 Jan-Feb,1992,Journal of computer assisted tomography,16,1,35-40,eng,False,10.1097/00004728-199201000-00007,Journal Article,"Brain/*blood supply;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery;*Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Radiosurgery/methods;*Stereotaxic Techniques",,False,0.04131435297996978,True

31043153,Risk of Brain Arteriovenous Malformation Hemorrhage Before and After Stereotactic Radiosurgery.,"Background and Purpose- Understanding the hemorrhage risks associated with brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) before and after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is important. The aims of this multicenter, retrospective cohort study are to evaluate and compare the rates of pre- and post-SRS AVM hemorrhage and identify risk factors. Methods- We pooled AVM SRS data from 8 institutions participating in the International Radiosurgery Research Foundation. Predictors of post-SRS hemorrhage were determined using a multivariate logistic regression model. Pre- and post-SRS hemorrhage rates were compared using Fisher exact test. Ruptured and unruptured AVMs were matched in a 1:1 ratio using propensity scores, and their outcomes were compared. Results- The study cohort comprised 2320 AVM patients who underwent SRS. Deep AVM location (odds ratio, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.19-2.92; P=0.007), the presence of an AVM-associated arterial aneurysm (odds ratio, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.63-3.66; P<0.001), and lower SRS margin dose (odds ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.88-0.98; P=0.005) were independent predictors of post-SRS hemorrhage. The post-SRS hemorrhage rate was lower for obliterated versus patent AVMs (6.0 versus 22.3 hemorrhages/1000 person-years; P<0.001). The AVM hemorrhage rate decreased from 15.4 hemorrhages/1000 person-years before SRS to 11.9 after SRS ( P=0.001). The outcomes of the matched ruptured versus unruptured AVM cohorts were similar. Conclusions- SRS appears to reduce the risk of AVM hemorrhage, although this effect is predominantly driven by obliteration. Deep-seated AVMs are more likely to rupture during the latency period after SRS. AVM-associated aneurysms should be considered for selective occlusion before SRS of the nidus to ameliorate the post-SRS hemorrhage rate of these lesions.",2019 Jun,2019,Stroke,50,6,1384-1391,eng,False,10.1161/STROKEAHA.118.024230;10.1161/STROKEAHA.118.024230,Journal Article;Multicenter Study,Adolescent;Adult;Cerebral Hemorrhage/*epidemiology/*etiology;Child;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*epidemiology/*radiotherapy;Male;Middle Aged;Predictive Value of Tests;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects;Retrospective Studies;Risk Factors,cerebral arteries;intracranial hemorrhages;radiosurgery;risk factors;vascular malformations,True,0.7186095811776387,False

17121129,Radiosurgical treatment for rolandic arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECT: The authors reviewed the radiosurgical outcomes in patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) located in the rolandic area, including the primary motor and sensory gyri. METHODS: The study population consisted of 38 patients with rolandic-area AVMs who underwent linear accelerator radiosurgery at the University of Toronto between 1989 and 2000. Obliteration rate, risk of hemorrhage during the latency period, radiation-induced complications, seizure control, and functional status were evaluated. Patients were also divided into two subgroups according to AVM volume (< 3 cm3 and > or = 3 cm3). Patients were followed up for a median of 42.4 months (range 30-103 months), and the median age of the patients was 40 years (range 12-67 years). The median AVM volume was 8.1 cm3 (range 0.32-21, mean 8.32 cm3), and the median dose at the tumor margin was 15 Gy (range 15-22, mean 16.8 Gy). The risk of hemorrhage after radiosurgery was 5.3% for the 1st year, 2.6% for the 2nd, and 0% for the 3rd. Two patients (5.3%) sustained adverse effects related to radiation for more than 6 months. Complete nidus obliteration after a single radiosurgical treatment was achieved in 23 patients (60.5%). The obliteration rate for AVMs smaller than 3 cm3 was 83.3% (10 of 12) and that for AVMs larger than or equal to 3 cm3 was 50% (13 of 26). Among the patients who had seizures as the initial presentation, 51.8% were free of seizures after radiosurgery and the seizure pattern improved in 40.7% during the 3rd and last year of follow up. Overall, excellent results (obliteration and no new or worsening neurological deficit) can be achieved in approximately 60% of patients. This percentage varies according to the AVM size and can reach 83% in patients with AVMs smaller than 3 cm3. CONCLUSIONS: Radiosurgery is a safe and effective treatment for people with rolandic AVMs. The low rate of morbidity associated with radiosurgery, compared with other treatments, indicates that this method may be the first choice for patients with AVMs located in this area.",2006 Nov,2006,Journal of neurosurgery,105,5,689-97,eng,False,10.3171/jns.2006.105.5.689,Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Child;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/mortality/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;*Motor Cortex;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects;Recovery of Function;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome,,True,0.7838806024968293,False

18787195,"Patterns of brain arteriovenous malformation treatment: prospective, population-based study.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The extent of variation in the interventional treatment of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is unknown, so we explored patterns of treatment at 4 neuroscience centers in one European country. METHODS: We included every participant with an AVM in a prospective, population-based cohort study of adults aged >or=16 years residing in Scotland at the time of AVM diagnosis in 1999 to 2003. RESULTS: Only 11 (5%) of the 229 adults were not managed at a neuroscience center. Adults who received interventional treatment were younger (median, 43 versus 54 years), more likely to have presented with hemorrhage (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.6 to 4.9), and had smaller AVMs (median nidus diameter, 2 cm versus 3 cm; P=0.003) than those who did not. Adults seen at the 4 centers only differed in AVM Spetzler-Martin grade (P=0.04). The 4 centers did not differ in the proportion of adults with AVMs who received interventional treatment (P=0.16), but they differed in the Spetzler-Martin grade of the AVMs they treated (Grades III to IV, P=0.01) and the interventional treatments used (P=0.004). The 2 largest centers differed from each other in the likelihood of surgical resection (OR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1 to 0.6) and stereotactic radiosurgery (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.3 to 6.1), and the choice of modality varied within some Spetzler-Martin grades.

21990534,Supernova hemorrhage: obliterative hemorrhage of brain arteriovenous malformations following γ knife radiosurgery.,"Hemorrhage represents the most feared complication of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in both untreated patients and those treated with gamma knife radiosurgery. Radiosurgery does not immediately lead to obliteration of the malformation, which often does not occur until years following treatment. Post-obliteration hemorrhage is rare, occurring months to years after radiosurgery, and has been associated with residual or recurrent AVM despite prior apparent nidus elimination. Three cases are reported of delayed intracranial hemorrhage in patients with cerebral AVMs treated with radiosurgery in which no residual AVM was found on catheter angiography at the time of delayed post-treatment hemorrhage. That the pathophysiology of these hemorrhages involves progressive venous outflow occlusion is speculated and the possible mechanistic link to subsequent vascular rupture is discussed.",2012 Sep,2012,Journal of neurointerventional surgery,4,5,364-7,eng,False,10.1136/neurintsurg-2011-010098;neurintsurg-2011-010098;10.1136/neurintsurg-2011-010098,Case Reports;Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Cerebral Hemorrhage/*diagnosis/*etiology;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects;Treatment Outcome,,False,0.1711732820835817,True
7910071,Implementation of stereotactic focal radiotherapy for intracranial arteriovenous malformations using a linear accelerator.,"A system of stereotactic focal radiotherapy using a linear accelerator has been developed in cooperation with a neurosurgeon. The treatment is delivered using a carefully calibrated 10 MV machine and the Cosman-Roberts-Wells (CRW) system. The precision of the method as well as its quality assurance is described. Eight patients with intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVM) received irradiation from August 1990 to November 1991. The prescribed dose at the periphery of the AVM was 8 Gy per session, with six patients receiving two sessions and two patients receiving one session. The field size, encompassing the 90% isodose, ranged from 20 mm to 35 mm. In four patients, follow-up angiography was performed one year after the full course of therapy; total obliteration of the AVM was noted in three (75%) with a partial response in the other. In the other four patients, follow-up angiography was not performed; one patient, who had only one session of irradiation, experienced rebleeding six months later and died, and the other three patients had no further episodes of bleeding during their follow-up of 28, 18 and 14 months, respectively. Linear accelerator-based stereotactic focal radiotherapy can attain a precisely defined and reproducible dose distribution. The effects of this treatment may take one to two years to develop. Our preliminary study suggests that it is an effective alternative treatment for surgically inaccessible lesions. Patients with a small cavernous sinus dural AVM appear to have a better and more rapid response.",1993 Nov,1993,Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan yi zhi,92,11,988-94,eng,False,,Journal Article;Review,Adult;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Particle Accelerators;*Radiosurgery/methods;*Stereotaxic Techniques,,False,0.1313813148513064,True

Image fusion of objects within the phantom indicated the central area was accurately depicted by CT or MRI. We then tested a newer CRW- MRI ring (MRIA-IHR with titanium screws and posts) and localizer (MRIA-2-LF with fiducials filled with copper sulfate) and found that the MRI stereotactically calculated target coordinates matched both the known position of these targets in the phantom as well as the CT stereotactically calculated coordinates within approximately 1 mm. We also describe excellent superimposition of CT and MRI stereotactically determined surfaces in a recent clinical case using the new hardware. This shows that recent modifications to the CRW-MRI stereotactic system can make it accurate for small targets, but we emphasize that all systems need to undergo ongoing local quality assessment to ensure acceptable accuracy in practice.",1999,1999,Stereotactic and functional neurosurgery,72,1,35-46,eng,False,29670;10.1159/000029670,Journal Article,"Brain/anatomy & histology/diagnostic imaging;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*instrumentation/*standards;Phantoms, Imaging;Radiosurgery;Stereotaxic Techniques/*instrumentation/*standards;Tomography, X-Ray Computed",,False,0.06020648955125154,True
19445567,Validation of the radiosurgery-based arteriovenous malformation score in a large linear accelerator radiosurgery experience.,"OBJECT: The radiosurgery-based arteriovenous malformation (AVM) score (RBAS) is a grading system designed to predict patient outcomes after Gamma Knife surgery for AVMs. This study seeks to validate independently the predictive nature of the RBAS, not only after single treatment but for retreatment, and to assess the overall outcome regardless of number of radiosurgeries. METHODS: The authors analyzed 403 patients treated with linear accelerator (LINAC) radiosurgery for AVMs between May 1988 and June 2008. The AVM scores were determined by the following equation: AVM score = (0.1 x volume in cm(3)) + (0.02 x age in years) + (0.3 x location). The location values are as follows: frontal/temporal = 0, parietal/occipital/corpus callosum/cerebellar = 1, and basal ganglia/thalamus/brainstem = 2. RESULTS: Testing demonstrated that the RBAS correlated with excellent outcomes after single or repeat radiosurgery (p < 0.001 for both variables). One hundred sixty-two (49%) of 330 patients had excellent outcomes (obliteration without deficit) after a single treatment. Excellent outcomes were achieved in 74, 64, 50, and 11% of patients with AVM scores of < 1.0 (Group 1), between 1.0 and < 1.8 (Group 2), between 1.8 and < 2.5 (Group 3), and >or= 2.5 (Group 4), respectively. Fifty-one patients (70%) obtained radiosurgical cure and 46 (63%) achieved excellent outcomes after repeat radiosurgery. Of these, 100% achieved excellent outcomes in Group 1, 70% did so in Group 2, 47% in Group 3, and 14% in Group 4. The RBAS correlated with excellent outcomes after overall treatment (p < 0.001). Two hundred seventy-seven patients (69%) obtained AVM obliteration, and 62% achieved excellent outcomes. In Group 1, 87% achieved excellent outcomes, 75% did so in Group 2, 61% in Group 3, and 24% in Group 4.

37026338,Volume Fractionation Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Large Volume Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations.,"Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are common intracranial vascular anomalies. Common treatment modalities used to manage AVMs are surgical excision, embolization, and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Large AVMs are defined as AVMs larger than 10 cm(3) and pose a therapeutic challenge with high rates of treatment-related morbidity and mortality. Single-stage SRS is a good option for small AVMs but carries high risks of radiation-induced complications in large AVMs. Volume-staged SRS (VS-SRS) is a newer strategy used in large AVMs that allows one to deliver an optimal radiation dose to the AVMs while reducing the risk of radiation damage to the normal brain. It involves the division of AVM into multiple small sectors which are irradiated at different time intervals with high radiation doses.

Nine patients had a pathologically verified foreign-tissue lesion, e.g., tumor or vascular malformation, and 1 patient had gliosis. All patients with foreign-tissue lesions were rendered seizure-free. The patient with gliosis experienced a reduction in seizure tendency. There were no operative complications. The most common seizure type was a simple partial seizure with visual, motor, or sensory symptoms (n = 8). Complex partial seizures (n = 5) and secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTC, n = 2) were also observed. The ictal behavior was often nonspecific although useful in identifying lateralization of the epileptogenic zone. Extracranial interictal and ictal EEG changes were unreliable markers of the parietal lobe origin of seizure activity.

11310368,Microsurgical treatment of deep arteriovenous malformations--basal ganglia and thalamus.,"BACKGROUND: Surgery for deep nuclei arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is controversial after the introduction of stereotactic irradiation and embolization. However, rupture of an AVM in this location can lead to catastrophic parenchymal or intraventricular hemorrhage. Thus, microsurgery still has its place in treatment of such lesions to prevent the untreated AVM bleeding or rebleeding. We present a series of 16 AVMs located in the deep nuclei treated by direct microsurgery before radiosurgery was available in 1993. METHODS: We reviewed the clinical and angiographic characteristic of 16 patients with deep-seated AVMs (three in caudate nucleus, three in lentiform nucleus and ten in thalamus). The surgical approach was described separately depending upon the location of the AVMs. The surgical outcomes were classified as excellent (symptoms improved), good (no additional neurological deficit), fair (minor neurological deficit), bad (major neurological deficit) and dead. RESULTS: Complete AVM elimination was achieved in 16 patients (100%) in one-stage operation. Eleven patients had excellent or good outcomes, three had fair outcomes and two had bad outcomes. There were no deaths in this series. Two patients had permanent hemiparesis to make a late morbidity rate of 12.5%.

23570151,Surgical management of Spetzler-Martin grade V AVM.,"The surgical management of giant arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) has been complicated and fraught with considerable risk. We retrospectively analysed seven patients with giant AVMs classified into Spetzler-Martin Grade V between 1993 and 1999. Six of seven surgical cases presented with haemorrhagic episodes and the other single case developed progressive neurological deficits. Four out of seven surgical cases developed haemorrhagic complications during surgery or postoperatively. This resulted in poor outcomes in two of four cases. The other five cases recovered well from surgery. Although no morbidity was found after preoperative embolisation in this series, incomplete embolisation did not decrease the rate of haemorrhagic complication. Nonhaemorrhagic complications of a new focal neurological deficit occurred in three cases, one case in hemiparesis and two cases in quadrant hemianopsia. This resulted in surgical injury of white matter pathway where deep feeders such as the lenticulostriate arteries or wedge shape nidus were evident. Successful removal of giant AVM depends on not only stepwise obliteration of AVM but also successful management of the deep feeders that may reside in white matter pathways. Preoperative embolisation should target inaccessible deep feeders.",2002 May,2002,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society,9 Suppl 1,,22-5,eng,False,,Journal Article,"Adult;Cerebral Hemorrhage/pathology/surgery;Combined Modality Therapy;Embolization, Therapeutic;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*pathology/*surgery/therapy;Intraoperative Complications/pathology;Male;Middle Aged;Postoperative Complications/pathology;Preoperative Care;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",,False,0.17816721771249389,True
8621291,Radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations: assessment of early phase magnetic resonance imaging and significance of gadolinium-DTPA enhancement.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the initial changes within the nidus of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and to assess the reaction to the brain tissue surrounding AVMs after radiosurgery by serial magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-one patients, treated using 60Co gamma knife unit with cerebral AVMs, were retrospectively evaluated. Forty-seven follow-up MR images of the 21 patients were performed including 10 patients with two or more serial gadolinium enhanced studies (Gd-MR). Two or more sequential MR angiographies (MRA) were obtained in 13 patients. Three-dimensional (3D) time-of-flight MRA and two-dimensional (2D) phase contrast MRA were used in 13 patients for evaluating the flow changes of AVMs. The follow-up period after radiosurgery ranged from 3 to 30 months (average 10.8 months) and the interval time of MRI ranged from 34 days to 13 months (average 4.9 months). RESULTS: Reduction of nidus size was observed in 14 of 21 patients (67%) between 4 to 13 months on spin echo (SE) images. Complete obliteration was observed on SE images in 4 of these 14 patients; three were confirmed by conventional angiography. New hyperintense areas surrounding the nidus on T2s-weighted images (T2WI) developed in 9 of the 14 patients who showed nidus reduction between 5 to 17 months after radiosurgery; in three patients, size of the hyperintense area started to decrease between 6 to 7 months after its appearance. Probable radiation necrosis of pons developed in one patient 26 months after radiosurgery. The irradiated area within the AVM nidus was significantly enhanced in 8 of the 10 patients who underwent Gd-MR. The degrees of enhancement within the nidus increased with time in 7 of the 10 patients. Overall, total enhancement of irradiated areas was observed in four of the 10 patients; in three of the four, the enhancement decreased in size and degree, indicating nidus reduction. In three patients who had a partial volume irradiation within the nidus, the enhancing areas corresponded with the exact portions of irradiated volume. The nidus reduction was observed in 7 of the 13 patients on MRA during 5 to 13 months after radiosurgery. MRA was more useful compared to SE images in four of the seven patients in evaluating the size change of AVM nidus, feeding arteries, and draining veins. CONCLUSION: Magnetic resonance imaging and MRA were useful in assessing the progress of nidus reduction. T2-weighted imaging was sensitive to radiation-induced reaction in and around the AVM nidus. The enhancement within the AVM nidus on Gd-MR may represent the initial sign of nidus reduction and demonstrates the exact location of irradiation in the nidus. The changes of the enhancement pattern are presumed to represent the processes of nidus reduction and irradiated reaction within the AVM nidus.",1996 Feb 1,1996,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",34,3,663-75,eng,False,0360301695021604;10.1016/0360-3016(95)02160-4,Clinical Trial;Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Aged;*Contrast Media;Evaluation Studies as Topic;Female;Gadolinium DTPA;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnosis/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Angiography/methods;Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods;Male;Middle Aged;*Organometallic Compounds;Pentetic Acid/*analogs & derivatives;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies,,False,0.1341094519421602,True
25293662,Application of single-stage stereotactic radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations >10 cm3.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a safe and effective treatment for small arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), the use of this modality for the treatment of large AVMs is still controversial, although it has been used in difficult cases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the treatment outcomes of patients who underwent single-stage SRS for large AVMs and to discuss the role of SRS in the treatment of these challenging lesions. METHODS: Between 1998 and 2010, 65 patients with AVMs >10 cm(3) underwent single-stage SRS using the Leksell Gamma Knife. Patients who had prospective volume-staged SRS were excluded from this series. Outcomes including the rates of obliteration, hemorrhage after treatment, and adverse events were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: The mean nidus volume was 14.9 cm(3) (±3.8 cm(3)), and a mean margin dose of 20 Gy (±1.5 Gy) was applied. The mean observation period was 60 months (range, 7-178 months). The nidus obliteration rates after SRS were 44%, 76%, and 81% at 3, 5, and 6 years, respectively. The annual hemorrhage rate after SRS was 1.94% and permanent adverse events were observed in 2 patients (3%).

38104931,Natural History and Histopathology of Expanding Cysts and Hematomas After Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Arteriovenous Malformations of the Brain: A Case Series.,"BACKGROUND: We reviewed the clinical course and histopathologic findings for cases involving the formation of expanding cysts and/or hematomas after gamma knife surgery (GKS) for arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). METHODS: We report a single-center retrospective review of 18 patients who presented with cyst and/or hematoma expansion after GKS for AVMs between 1993 and 2023. Expanding cysts and hematomas were defined as well-demarcated cavities filled with fluid or well-marginated heterogenous hematomas presenting with expansion proximal to or in the location of the original AVM, respectively. Patient demographics, AVM characteristics, history of interventions and surgeries, and imaging and histopathologic features of expanding cysts and hematomas were collected for analysis. RESULTS: Among 1072 AVM patients treated using GKS, 18 presented with expanding cysts or hematomas during a total follow-up period of 16,757 patient-years (0.11 case/100 persons/patient-year). The time to cyst or hematoma identification was 4-13 years after initial GKS, with a mean duration of 8.6 years. Among the patients examined, 7 (38.9%) presented mainly with hematoma, 10 (55.6%) presented mainly with cysts, and 1 presented with approximately equal components of both. Among the 18 patients, 13 (72.2%) underwent craniotomy to treat cyst or hematoma expansion. All the specimens had similar histopathologic characteristics, including organizing hematoma with fresh and old hemorrhage, fibrinoid necrosis of the vessels, gliosis of normal brain tissue, infiltration of hemosiderin-laden histiocytes, and extravascular protein leakage.

16475146,MR angiography fusion technique for treatment planning of intracranial arteriovenous malformations.,"PURPOSE: To develop an image fusion technique using elliptical centric contrast-enhanced (CE) MR angiography (MRA) and three-dimensional (3D) time-of-flight (TOF) acquisitions for radiosurgery treatment planning of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: CE and 3D-TOF MR angiograms with disparate in-plane fields of view (FOVs) were acquired, followed by k-space reformatting to provide equal voxel dimensions. Spatial domain addition was performed to provide a third, fused data volume. Spatial distortion was evaluated on an MRA phantom and provided slice-dependent and global distortion along the three physical dimensions of the MR scanner. In vivo validation was performed on 10 patients with intracranial AVMs prior to their conventional angiogram on the day of gamma knife radiosurgery. RESULTS: Spatial distortion in the phantom within a volume of 14 x 14 x 3.2 cm(3) was less than +/-1 mm (+/-1 standard deviation (SD)) for CE and 3D-TOF data sets. Fused data volumes were successfully generated for all 10 patients. CONCLUSION: Image fusion can be used to obtain high-resolution CE-MRA images of intracranial AVMs while keeping the fiducial markers needed for gamma knife radiosurgery planning. The spatial fidelity of these data is within the tolerance acceptable for daily quality control (QC) purposes and gamma knife treatment planning.",2006 Mar,2006,Journal of magnetic resonance imaging : JMRI,23,3,361-9,eng,False,10.1002/jmri.20519,Journal Article,"Adult;Algorithms;Contrast Media;Female;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*pathology/surgery;Magnetic Resonance Angiography/*methods;Male;Middle Aged;*Patient Care Planning;Phantoms, Imaging;Radiosurgery",,False,0.06493026123838537,True
32419509,Same day embolisation followed by microsurgical resection of brain arteriovenous malformations: a single centre early experience.,"INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this paper is to report our experience of treating cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM) in adults with pre-operative embolisation and microsurgical resection on the same day during a single anaesthetic at a single centre between April 2016 and December 2018. We included both elective AVM and AVM that had bled acutely. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed data from patients with cerebral AVMs who underwent embolisation followed by microsurgical resection on the same day at a single neurosurgical centre. PRIMARY ENDPOINTS INCLUDED: Total procedure time (embolisation and microsurgical resection), procedure finish time, intra-operative blood loss, degree of nidus obliteration on postoperative angiography, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, total stay at the neurosurgical centre and modified Rankin Score (pre- and post-procedure). RESULTS: •Nineteen patients underwent same-day pre-operative embolisation and microsurgical resection over the 32-month period. The average patient age was 40 years (range 19-66 years). One patient had undergone a prior attempt at embolisation and one patient previously had sterotactic radiosurgery (STRS). •Thirteen of the AVM were in the dominant hemisphere and six in the non-dominant hemisphere. Sixteen AVM were located supratentorially and three were in the posterior fossa. Spetzler-Martin grades included 4 grade 1, 10 grade 2, 4 grade 3 and 1 grade 4. •The average blood loss intra-operatively was 289 mls. •The average list finish time was 19:56 (range 15:10-00:00). •Seventeen patients had 100% nidus obliteration on post-operative digital subtraction angiography, one patient had a small remnant and was referred to STRS and one patient died in the ICU post operatively. CONCLUSION: Overall, the authors believe same-day embolisation and microsurgical resection represents a safe treatment strategy.

7931614,Clinical and radiological evaluation of long-term results of stereotactic proton beam radiosurgery in patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"Within a period of nearly 10 years, from October, 1980, to May, 1990, a total of 68 patients with a cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) were referred to a radiosurgical center in the United States for stereotactic Bragg peak proton beam therapy. Radiosurgery was chosen as an alternative treatment, either because the AVM was considered to be of high surgical risk due to its size and/or location, or because the patient refused surgery. In 63 patients (92.6%), complete clinical and radiological follow-up examinations were available. Clinical and radiological long-term results were correlated to size and to the Spetzler-Martin scale of the AVM. With increasing size or higher grade on the Spetzler-Martin scale, the clinical results of proton beam therapy became progressively worse. Of 37 patients with an AVM between 3 and 6 cm in diameter, only one-third showed amelioration of their clinical symptoms, and two-thirds remained the same or even deteriorated after radiation treatment. The same results apply to patients with very large AVM's, of whom only one-third profited from proton beam therapy. Although 85.7% of the patients in Spetzler-Martin Grades I and II showed postirradiation amelioration of their clinical symptoms, this compares to only 54.2% of the patients in Grade III, and only 24% in Grade IV. In regard to the radiological results of proton beam therapy, complete obliteration during long-term observation was only detectable in 10 patients or 15.9%, which is less than one-sixth of the whole group of 63 patients. All of these obliterated AVM's were smaller than 3 cm. Almost 85% of the patients treated using stereotactic proton beam therapy did not show any angiographic change in the radiological appearance of their AVM. The results reported here indicate that radiosurgery using stereotactic proton beam therapy is ineffective for the treatment of medium- or large-sized AVM's and should not be recommended for patients harboring an AVM larger than 3 cm. If proton beam treatment is contemplated, it should be restricted to AVM's that are less than 3 cm in size and whose location makes them easily accessible only for proton beam therapy.",1994 Nov,1994,Journal of neurosurgery,81,5,683-9,eng,False,10.3171/jns.1994.81.5.0683,Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Cerebral Angiography;Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology;Cohort Studies;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/pathology/*surgery;Longitudinal Studies;Male;Middle Aged;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects/methods;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome,,False,0.32179000170272093,True
26704216,Delayed Hemorrhage After Treatment of Brain Arteriovenous Malformations (AVMs).,"OBJECTIVE: The risk of delayed hemorrhage occurring greater than 2 years after treatment in brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) rarely is reported. In this study, we compare the risk of delayed hemorrhage across different treatment modalities. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of treated patients with a single intracranial AVM seen at our institution from 1990 to 2013. Delayed hemorrhage was defined as hemorrhage occurring at least 2 years after last treatment. Survival analysis was used to assess risk of delayed hemorrhage by treatment modalities. RESULTS: Our study included 420 patients. Spetzler-Martin grades were as follows: I (12.6%), II (36.2%), III (32.6%), IV (15.0%), and V (3.6%). Average follow-up time is 5.1 years. Twenty-two patients (5.2%) were found to have 28 delayed hemorrhages. Average interval between last treatment and delayed hemorrhage was 7.6 years, with the longest being 24.2 years. Proportions of delayed hemorrhages by treatment modalities were as follows: surgery ± embolization (group I, 9.1%), radiosurgery ± embolization (group II, 63.6%), embolization only (group III, 22.7%), and surgery + radiosurgery ± embolization (group IV, 4.5%). Annualized hemorrhage risk after 2 years for each treatment group was as follows: group I (0.4%), group II (1.2%), group III (3.7%), and group IV (1.7%). Survival analysis demonstrated lowest risk of delayed hemorrhage for group 1 (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to compare the risk of delayed hemorrhage across different treatment modalities. Surgical resection is associated with the lowest risk for delayed hemorrhage compared with other treatment modalities. Patients with partially embolized AVMs should seek timely definitive treatment to decrease the risk of delayed hemorrhage.",2016 Mar,2016,World neurosurgery,87,,98-109,eng,False,S1878-8750(15)01658-7;10.1016/j.wneu.2015.11.057;S1878-8750(15)01658-7;10.1016/j.wneu.2015.11.057,Case Reports;Comparative Study;Journal Article,"Acute Disease;Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Cerebral Angiography;Cerebral Hemorrhage/*etiology;Child;Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic;*Embolization, Therapeutic/adverse effects;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Headache/etiology;Hematoma/etiology;Hemiplegia/etiology;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnosis/diagnostic;Kaplan-Meier Estimate;Male;Medical Records;Middle Aged;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects;Retrospective Studies;Risk Factors;Time Factors;Treatment Outcome",Arteriovenous malformation;Delayed hemorrhage;Latency period;Posttreatment,False,0.29884735899570175,True
8880765,The contralateral transcallosal approach: experience with 32 patients.,"OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the usefulness of the contralateral transcallosal approach for resecting lesions located laterally in or adjacent to the lateral ventricle. METHODS: Modifications to the standard ipsilateral transcallosal technique include positioning the head with the midline oriented horizontally, placing the side with the lesion up, and performing the craniotomy and interhemispheric dissection on the contralateral side. This approach avoids a transcortical incision, allows gravity to hold open the interhemispheric fissure, and increases the lateral exposure of the lesion. This approach was used in 32 patients with a variety of lesions, including 6 cavernous malformations, 7 arteriovenous malformations, and 19 tumors of various types. All but three lesions were located on the left side. RESULTS: All six cavernous malformations, all four benign tumors, and four of the seven arteriovenous malformations were resected completely. Malignant tumors were resected subtotally, and three arteriovenous malformations required stereotactic radiosurgery to treat residual deep nidus. There was no surgical mortality. Two patients experienced neurological deterioration.

8517190,Radiological aspects of gamma knife radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations and other non-tumoural disorders of the brain.,"The aims of the thesis were to investigate stereotaxic procedures in radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and radiation effects of single session high-dose irradiation delivered by gamma knife on the human brain. Investigation of gamma knife radiosurgery in 1,464 patients constitutes the data base of this thesis. High quality stereotaxic angiography is the gold standard targeting imaging in radiosurgery for cerebral AVMs, particularly for small AVMs or residual AVMs after other treatments. For medium and large size AVMs, stereotaxic MR techniques can improve targeting precision and decrease irradiation volume as compared to stereotaxic angiography in selected cases provided that proper pulse sequences are used. Combined treatments, where embolization precedes radiosurgery, can improve amenability of the treatment for large AVMs. This is on condition that the partially embolized nidi are well delineated and the volume of the residual nidi has been decreased to a level where an optimum irradiation can be safely prescribed. Radiologically, adverse radiation effects (ARE) of gamma knife radiosurgery for cerebral AVMs are observed in 16% (131/816) of the patients. The ARE are observed as a focal low attenuation on CT or as a focal high signal on MR image without enhancement in 47% (61/131), and as a peripheral or homogeneous enhancing lesion in 48% (63/131). MR imaging is more sensitive than CT in detecting the ARE. 91% of the ARE are observed within 18 months after radiosurgery and 89% are seen to regress within 18 months. Clinically, symptomatic ARE are only observed in 6% (51/816) and only in half of them, i.e. 3%, are the symptoms permanent. The risk of ARE in radiosurgery for venous angiomas is higher as compared to AVMs. Other mechanisms have probably been employed. In gamma capsulotomy, the necrotic lesions and reaction volumes created by using multiple isocentres of 4 mm collimators are less predictable as compared to that by single isocentre. Volume effects and depreciation of the steep isodose gradient are hypothesised as the leading factors of the inconsistency. Based on the in vivo assessment of the radiation effects observed on the basically normal human brain it is concluded that irradiation volume is strongly related to the radiation effects and is one of the important considerations in decision making for radiosurgery. Volume of brain tissue exposed to irradiation could be minimised and precision of targeting could be maximised provided that a proper stereotaxic imaging is used.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",1993,1993,Acta radiologica.

9672015,Radiosurgery as a treatment alternative for dural arteriovenous fistulas of the cavernous sinus.,"PURPOSE: Radiosurgery is an effective treatment for cerebral arteriovenous malformations. We conducted the present study to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of gamma knife radiosurgery for dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) of the cavernous sinus. METHODS: Eighteen patients (12 women and six men; 29-75 years old [mean age, 55 years]) with DAVFs of the cavernous sinus (Barrow's type B:1, C:7, and D:10) treated by gamma knife radiosurgery were enrolled in the study. DAVFs were bilateral in six patients and unilateral in 12. Stereotactic X-ray angiography and MR imaging were performed for targeting the radiosurgery. Areas of arteriovenous communication targeted for irradiation were first outlined on the X-ray angiograms. The target regions were then transferred to and displayed on the MR images. Dose planning was based on findings on the integrated images. Prescribed maximum target doses were 22 to 38 Gy (mean, 28 Gy). The targets were covered by 50% to 90% isodose levels. Radiation doses to the surrounding optic apparatus were kept to less than 8 Gy. The patients were followed up with color Doppler sonography and MR imaging. When noninvasive imaging suggested obliteration, X-ray angiography was performed to verify the results. RESULTS: The DAVFs were totally obliterated in 12 (80%) of the 15 patients. In the other three, one was almost completely obliterated at 14 months and two were partially obliterated at 19 and 27 months, respectively, after radiosurgery. No complications or symptom worsening occurred during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION: Gamma knife radiosurgery is a feasible, effective, and safe treatment for DAVFs of the cavernous sinus.

17974613,Neurologic complications of arteriovenous malformation embolization using liquid embolic agents.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Embolization of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is commonly used to achieve nidal volume reduction before microsurgical resection or stereotactic radiosurgery. The purpose of this study was to examine the overall neurologic complication rate in patients undergoing AVM embolization and analyze the factors that may determine increased risk. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all patients with brain AVMs embolized at 1 center from 1995 through 2005. Demographics, including age, sex, presenting symptoms, and clinical condition, were recorded. Angiographic factors including maximal nidal size, presence of deep venous drainage, and involvement of eloquent cortex were also recorded. For each embolization session, the agent used, number of pedicles embolized, the percentage of nidal obliteration, and any complications were recorded. Complications were classified as the following: none, non-neurologic (mild), transient neurologic deficit, and permanent nondisabling and permanent disabling deficits. The permanent complications were also classified as ischemic or hemorrhagic. Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores were collected pre- and postembolization on all patients. Univariate regression analysis of factors associated with the development of any neurologic complication was performed. RESULTS: Four hundred eighty-nine embolization procedures were performed in 192 patients. There were 6 Spetzler-Martin grade I (3.1%), 26 grade II (13.5%), 71 grade III (37.0%), 57 grade IV (29.7%), and 32 grade V (16.7%) AVMs. Permanent nondisabling complications occurred in 5 patients (2.6%) and permanent disabling complications or deaths occurred in 3 (1.6%). In addition, there were non-neurologic complications in 4 patients (2.1%) and transient neurologic deficits in 22 (11.5%). Five of the 8 permanent complications (2.6% overall) were ischemic, and 3 of 8 (1.6% overall) were hemorrhagic. Of the 178 patients who were mRS 0-2 pre-embolization, 4 (2.3%) were dependent or dead (mRS >2) at follow-up. Univariate analysis of risk factors for permanent neurologic deficits following embolization showed that basal ganglia location was weakly associated with a new postembolization neurologic deficit. CONCLUSION: Embolization of brain AVMs can be performed with a high degree of technical success and a low rate of permanent neurologic complications.",2008 Feb,2008,AJNR.

21047692,The accuracy of frameless stereotactic intracranial radiosurgery.,"PURPOSE: To determine the accuracy of frameless stereotactic radiosurgery using the BrainLAB ExacTrac system and robotic couch by measuring the individual contributions such as the accuracy of the imaging and couch correction system, the linkage between this system and the linac isocenter and the possible intrafraction motion of the patient in the frameless mask. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An Alderson head phantom with hidden marker was randomly positioned 31 times. Automated 6D couch shifts were performed according to ExacTrac and the deviation with respect to the linac isocenter was measured using the hidden marker. ExacTrac-based set-up was performed for 46 patients undergoing hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for 135 fractions, followed by verification X-rays. Forty-three of these patients received post-treatment X-ray verification for 79 fractions to determine the intrafraction motion. RESULTS: The hidden target test revealed a systematic error of 1.5 mm in one direction, which was corrected after replacement of the system calibration phantom. The accuracy of the ExacTrac positioning is approximately 0.3 mm in each direction, 1 standard deviation. The intrafraction motion was 0.35±0.21 mm, maximum 1.15 mm.

34982875,Effects of Preoperative Embolization on Spetzler-Martin Grade I and II Arteriovenous Malformations: A Propensity-Adjusted Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) with low Spetzler-Martin grades (I and II) are associated with good neurological outcomes after microsurgical resection; however, the use of preoperative embolization for these lesions is controversial. OBJECTIVE: To compare the neurological outcomes of preoperative embolization with no embolization in patients with low-grade AVMs. METHODS: Patients with a Spetzler-Martin grade I or II AVM who underwent microsurgical resection during January 1, 1997, through December 31, 2019, were analyzed. Patients undergoing preoperative embolization were compared with patients not undergoing embolization. A propensity score was constructed from baseline characteristics and used to match intervention (embolization) and control (nonembolization) groups in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome was poor neurological status on last follow-up examination, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score >2 and a modified Rankin Scale score worse at follow-up than at the preoperative examination. RESULTS: Of the 603 patients analyzed, 310 (51.4%) underwent preoperative embolization and 293 (48.6%) did not. Patients in the embolization cohort compared with those in the nonembolization cohort had a higher percentage of Spetzler-Martin grade II AVMs (71.6% vs 52.6%, P < .001) and a lower percentage of hemorrhage (41% vs 55%, P = .001). After propensity score matching, no differences were found between paired cohorts (each N = 203) for baseline characteristics with a significant reduction in absolute standardized mean differences. No significant differences were found in primary outcomes between treatment groups in the matched or unmatched cohorts.

28949989,In vivo imaging of endothelial cell adhesion molecule expression after radiosurgery in an animal model of arteriovenous malformation.,"Focussed radiosurgery may provide a means of inducing molecular changes on the luminal surface of diseased endothelium to allow targeted delivery of novel therapeutic compounds. We investigated the potential of ionizing radiation to induce surface expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) on endothelial cells (EC) in vitro and in vivo, to assess their suitability as vascular targets in irradiated arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Cultured brain microvascular EC were irradiated by linear accelerator at single doses of 0, 5, 15 or 25 Gy and expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 measured by qRT-PCR, Western, ELISA and immunocytochemistry. In vivo, near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence optical imaging using Xenolight 750-conjugated ICAM-1 or VCAM-1 antibodies examined luminal biodistribution over 84 days in a rat AVM model after Gamma Knife surgery at a single 15 Gy dose. ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were minimally expressed on untreated EC in vitro. Doses of 15 and 25 Gy stimulated expression equally; 5 Gy was not different from the unirradiated. In vivo, normal vessels did not bind or retain the fluorescent probes, however binding was significant in AVM vessels. No additive increases in probe binding were found in response to radiosurgery at a dose of 15 Gy. In summary, radiation induces adhesion molecule expression in vitro but elevated baseline levels in AVM vessels precludes further induction in vivo. These molecules may be suitable targets in irradiated vessels without hemodynamic derangement, but not AVMs. These findings demonstrate the importance of using flow-modulated, pre-clinical animal models for validating candidate proteins for vascular targeting in irradiated AVMs.",2017,2017,PloS one,12,9,e0185393,eng,False,10.1371/journal.pone.0185393;e0185393;PONE-D-17-16782;10.1371/journal.pone.0185393,Journal Article,"Animals;*Disease Models, Animal;Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/metabolism;Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/*metabolism;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*metabolism/*surgery;Male;Mice;Radiosurgery/*methods;Radiotherapy Dosage;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/*metabolism",,False,0.07718809050675773,True
35901714,Repeat stereotactic radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this retrospective, single-institution study was to evaluate radiological and clinical outcomes of patients managed with repeat stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for residual cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) after prior SRS. METHODS: The authors evaluated the clinical and radiological outcomes of consecutive patients treated with repeat single-session SRS for a residual brain AVM from 1989 to 2021. RESULTS: In total, 170 patients underwent repeat SRS for AVM (90 [52.9%] females; median [interquartile range] age at the first SRS procedure 28 [21.5] years; median [interquartile range] age at the second SRS procedure 32 [22.5] years). After repeat SRS, the actuarial 3-, 5-, and 10-year AVM obliteration rates were 37.6%, 57.3%, and 80.9%, respectively. Higher obliteration rates were associated with margin dose ≥ 19 Gy (p = 0.001). After the second SRS procedure, hemorrhage occurred in 8.2% of patients and was lethal in 1 patient. The risk factors of intracranial hemorrhage were age < 18 years (p = 0.03) and residual AVM diameter > 20 mm (p = 0.004). Lower obliteration rates were noted in patients with residual AVM diameter > 20 mm (p = 0.04) and those < 18 years of age (p = 0.04). Asymptomatic, symptomatic, and permanent radiation-induced changes (RICs) after the second SRS procedure occurred in 25.9%, 8.8%, and 5.3% of patients, respectively, and were associated with RIC after the first SRS procedure (p = 0.006). There was 1 case of a radiation-induced meningioma 12 years after SRS. CONCLUSIONS: Repeat SRS is a reasonable therapeutic option, in particular for patients with residual AVM. Repeat SRS was associated with more favorable outcomes in adult patients and those with residual AVM smaller than 20 mm in maximum diameter. To increase the rate of residual AVM obliteration, a prescription dose ≥ 19 Gy should ideally be used for repeat SRS.",2022 Jul,2022,Neurosurgical focus,53,1,E11,eng,True,10.3171/2022.4.FOCUS2294;10.3171/2022.4.FOCUS2294,Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/radiotherapy/surgery;Male;*Radiosurgery/methods;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome,Gamma Knife;arteriovenous malformations;cerebral;repeat stereotactic radiosurgery,True,0.8703141144678108,True
19147019,Optimization of isocenter location for intensity modulated stereotactic treatment of small intracranial targets.,"PURPOSE: To quantify the impact of isocenter location on treatment plan quality for intensity-modulated stereotactic treatment of small intracranial lesions. METHODS AND MATERIALS: For 18 patients previously treated by stereotactic-intensity modulated radiosurgery (IMRS) or intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), a retrospective virtual planning study was conducted wherein the impact of isocenter location on plan quality was measured. Treatment indications studied included six arteriovenous malformations, six acoustic neuromas, and six intracranial metastases, ranging in volume from 0.71 to 3.21 cm(3) (mean = 2.26 cm(3)), 1.08 to 2.84 cm(3) (mean = 1.73 cm(3)), and 0.19 to 2.30 cm(3) (mean = 0.79 cm(3)), respectively. Variation of isocenter location causes the geometric grid of pencil beams into which the target is segmented for intensity-modulated treatment to be altered. The impact of this pencil-beam-grid redefinition on achievable conformity index was quantified for three collimators (Varian Millennium 120; BrainLab MM3; Nomos binary Mimic) and three treatment planning systems (TPS; Varian Eclipse v6.5; BrainLab BrainScan v5.31; Best-Nomos Corvus v6.2), resulting in the evaluation of 3,446 treatment plans. RESULTS: For all patients, collimator, and TPS combinations studied, a significant variation in plan quality was observed as a function of isocenter and pencil-beam-grid relocation. Optimization of isocenter location resulted in treatment plan conformity variations as large as 109% (min = 15%, mean = 51%, max = 109%). CONCLUSION: Optimization of isocenter location for IMRT/IMRS treatment of small intracranial lesions in which pencil-beam dimensions are comparable to target dimensions, can result in significant improvements in treatment plan quality.",2009 Feb 1,2009,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",73,2,546-55,eng,False,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2008.09.011;S0360-3016(08)03463-9;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2008.09.011,Evaluation Study;Journal Article,"Brain Neoplasms/*radiotherapy/surgery;Cranial Irradiation/methods;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*radiotherapy/surgery;Neuroma, Acoustic/*radiotherapy/surgery;Radiosurgery/instrumentation/methods/standards;Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted;Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated/instrumentation/methods/*standards;Reference Values;Retrospective Studies",,False,0.13237996646892505,True

32534263,Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber Syndrome Associated with Multiple Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformations: Usefulness of Gamma Knife Stereotactic Radiosurgery in This Syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome (KTWS) is characterized by the presence of a combined vascular malformation of capillaries, veins, and lymphatic vessels; congenital venous abnormalities; and limb hypertrophy. Its association with neurovascular abnormalities is infrequent, and the presence of intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is extremely rare. CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case of a 48-year-old male diagnosed with KTWS who spontaneously presented with a cerebral hemorrhage. Computed tomography scan and angio-computed tomography studies revealed bleeding associated with AVM rupture. In the conventional arteriography study, 10 small (<1 cm) AVMs were observed. The patient presented a good clinical recovery. These multiple small lesions were not considered susceptible to surgical or endovascular treatments. Therefore all lesions were treated with Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery since it attains the highest dose drop and minimal irradiation of the healthy parenchyma. One year after the treatment, the lesions have shrunk. CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral AVMs are extremely rare in KTWS cases; however, their presence can have serious consequences if they are treated. We find it advisable to include brain imaging tests, such as nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, to diagnose and monitor KTWS. Furthermore, a Gamma Knife may be useful when multiple AVMs are present.",2020 Sep,2020,World neurosurgery,141,,425-429,eng,False,S1878-8750(20)31270-5;10.1016/j.wneu.2020.06.012;S1878-8750(20)31270-5;10.1016/j.wneu.2020.06.012,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Cerebral Hemorrhage/diagnosis/*surgery;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*complications/diagnosis/*surgery;Kaplan-Meier Estimate;Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber Syndrome/*complications/diagnosis/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods;Male;Middle Aged;Tomography, X-Ray Computed/methods",Arteriovenous malformations;Gamma Knife;Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome;Stereotactic radiosurgery,False,0.04116595895057001,True
9292264,Robotic radiosurgery with noncylindrical collimators.,"In radiosurgery, a moving beam of radiation acts as an ablative surgical instrument. Conventional systems for radiosurgery use a cylindrical radiation beam of fixed cross section. The radiation source can be moved only along simple, standardized paths. A new radiosurgical system based on a six-degree-of-freedom robotic arm has been developed to overcome limitations of conventional systems. We address the following question: Can dose distributions generated by robotic radiosurgery be improved by using noncylindrical radiation beams? This includes static noncylindrical collimators and collimators of adaptable cross section. Geometric methods for planning the shape of the beam in addition to planning beam motion are developed. Design criteria considered in this context are treatment time, radiation penumbra, and transparency of interactive treatment planning.

23258506,The technical evolution of gamma knife radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations.,"Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery was first applied for the treatment of an intracranial arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in 1968. Using biplane angiography to target a small-volume, deep-seated lesion, photons were cross-fired on the pathological shunt. The AVM was obliterated within 3 years. This began a cautious introduction of Gamma Knife radiosurgery in the 1970s. As the Gamma Knife technology spread to sites in Europe, South America and the USA in the 1980s, AVM radiosurgery became a primary indication. During the early years the usual standard was to deliver a single radiosurgical isocenter to the target defined by 2-dimensional angiography. Most patients had small-volume AVMs unsuitable for surgical excision. Over time the technique of Gamma Knife AVM surgery evolved to include: careful patient selection, discussion of appropriate treatment strategies, anticonvulsant administration for lobar locations and intraoperative targeting using both high-resolution axial plane imaging--usually magnetic resonance imaging--coupled with biplane digital subtraction angiography. High-speed computer dose planning integrated with more detailed imaging strategies facilitated conformal radiation delivery in a single treatment session coupled with high selectivity of the dose delivered. Multiple isocenters became routine. Long-term follow-up care included serial imaging evaluations to assess the response and to detect complications. Imaging was critical to confirm the desired radiobiological response--complete obliteration. Long-term follow-up after obliteration confirmed that AVM radiosurgery had a high success rate for properly selected patients and a risk-benefit profile that substantiated patient safety. Twenty-year results after Gamma Knife radiosurgery for AVMs are currently available. Established roles have been found for pediatric cases and for larger-volume AVMs unsuitable for surgical removal. The role and technique of embolization prior to radiosurgery continue to be evaluated.

19934562,Gamma knife radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations located in eloquent regions of the brain.,"BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiosurgery is an effective treatment strategy for selected group of patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the obliteration rates, complications, and patient outcomes after Gamma knife radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) located in eloquent regions of the brain with an emphasis on neurological morbidity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2000 and December 2005, 37 patients with AVMs in eloquent locations (sensory, motor, speech, visual cortex, basal ganglia, and brain stem) underwent stereotactic radiosurgery. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of these patients to asses the outcomes. Of the 37 patients, only two patients had prior embolization. Three underwent prospective staged volume radiosurgery. Two patients needed redo-radiosurgery for residual AVM. Mean target volume was 9.1 cc. Three lesions had nidus volume more than 20 cc. Average marginal dose was 18.75 Gy. The median duration of follow-up was 23 months (range, 6-60 months). 15 patients had follow-up of more than 36 months. RESULTS: A total of 15 patients had follow-up of more than 36 months, thus available for evaluation of angiographic obliteration rates. Complete angiographic obliteration was documented in seven patients (46.7%). Four patients experienced hemorrhage during the latency period. One patient who had subsequent hemorrhage on follow-up developed worsening of neurological deficit. One patient developed significant sensory symptoms which resolved after steroids. No additional clinical deterioration related to treatment was noted in rest of the patients.

Aneurysm treatment was followed by AVM treatment via various therapies, including embolization, gamma knife radiotherapy, or follow-up and observation to reduce the risk of aneurysm rupture or intracranial hemorrhage. Over a follow-up period ranging from six months to one year, none of the patients had aneurysm ruptures or intracranial hemorrhage. Most (13/14) patients had a Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score of 5, and one patient had a score of 4.

29248377,Management of a complex intracranial arteriovenous malformation with gamma knife radiosurgery: A case report with review of literature.,"The risks and benefits of arteriovenous malformation (AVM) treatment should be considered cautiously in each patient since management strategy of it depends on various factors including age of the patient, location and volume of AVM and presence of other vascular abnormalities. Current management options of AVM include observation, endovascular embolization, radiosurgery and microsurgical resection or in combination of any two of the above procedures. Here, we have discussed a case of intracranial AVM with radiation induced early cyst formation, and performed a literature review to determine the optimum treatment of complex intracranial AVM. Standard search strategies were performed in PubMed/Medline using appropriate terms such as ""intracranial arteriovenous malformation"" radiosurgery, embolization and microsurgical resection as well as medical subject headings. The particular case in this study was retrospectively reviewed. Literature review revealed that the mean marginal radiation dose used by the different authors was 19 Gy, cysts were developed in 3.6% patients, the average time to form cyst was 6.6 years, average volume of cyst was 6.7 ml and maximum cysts were removed by resection. In our case, the cyst was developed 2.5 years after radiosurgery. Radiation induced cyst formation is a delayed complication of AVM management. However, cyst formation in this case was comparatively earlier in our case. Therefore, continuous follow-up after radiosurgery is required for early detection of cyst formation.

27231973,Reappearance of arteriovenous malformations after complete resection of ruptured arteriovenous malformations: true recurrence or false-negative early postoperative imaging result?,"OBJECTIVE Ruptured arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are often obliterated after emergency microsurgical treatment. However, some studies have reported AVM recurrence after the obliteration of ruptured AVMs. The authors report their experience with AVM recurrence after successful microsurgical treatment of ruptured AVMs. METHODS The authors reviewed the medical data of 139 consecutive patients who underwent microsurgery at the authors' institution for ruptured AVM between 2002 and 2012. Each patient underwent a conventional cerebral angiography examination immediately after the surgery. Subsequent follow-ups were performed with MR angiography after 6 months, and, if there was no indication of AVM recurrence, patients were followed up with conventional cerebral angiography between 1 and 2 years after the treatment; pediatric patients were followed up until age 18 years. Recurrence was defined as new radiological evidence of an AVM at the site of a ruptured AVM or a new hemorrhage in patients with angiographically documented AVM obliteration on postoperative angiograms. RESULTS The mean age of the patients at the time of ruptured AVM diagnosis was 30.8 years (SD ± 5, range 4-69 years), and 44 of the patients were younger than 18 years (the mean age at diagnosis in this pediatric subgroup was 11.4 years [range 4-17.9 years]). Complete AVM obliteration after the initial microsurgery was observed in 123 patients (89.5%). Reappearance of an AVM was noted in 7 patients between 12 and 42 months after the treatment, and all of these patients were younger than 18 years. The recurrent AVM was located in an eloquent zone in 4 patients, and deep venous drainage was noted in 3 patients. Radiosurgery was performed in 6 of these patients, and 1 patient underwent another microsurgical procedure. The authors noted only one rebleeding due to an AVM recurrence during the latency period after radiosurgery. CONCLUSIONS The recurrence of an AVM is fairly rare and affects mostly pediatric patients.

Many of these lesions (45%) were in locations that might be considered surgically inaccessible such as the thalamus, brain stem, medial hemisphere, and paraventricular regions. Complete angiographic obliteration of the AVM by microsurgical technique was accomplished in 63 patients (94%) with a surgical morbidity of 1.5% and no operative mortality. Patients with hemispheric AVM's had a cure rate of 100% and no neurological morbidity. Stereotactically guided craniotomy was used in 14 patients (21%) to locate and resect deep or concealed malformations.

8679332,[Gamma knife treatment of AVM of the basal ganglia and thalamus].,"Arteriovenous malformatios (AVMs) in the basal ganglia (BG) and thalamus (Thal) are difficult to treat by microsurgery or intravascular embolization alone, and the role of stereotactic gamma radiosurgery (gamma knife) of these AVMs is discussed. We have treated 324 cases of AVM with gamma knife since May 1991, and in 71 of these cases (19%) the AVM was in the BG or Thal. The results of gamma radiosurgery on AVMs of the BG and Thal were compared with the results of treating AVMs at other intracranial locations by gamma radiosurgery. The nidi were small (mean diameter: 16.4 mm), and they were treated with a mean maximum dose of 36.4 Gy and marginal dose of 19.9 Gy. The results were evaluated angiographically in 39 (55%) of the 71 cases, with a mean follow-up period of 23 months. The complete obliteration rate of AVMs in the BG and Thal 1 and 2 years after treatment was 54.3% and 92.0%, respectively, and the rate at the other locations was 42.9% and 76.0%, respectively. Adverse effects of this treatment in the AVM cases overall were rebleeding from the nidus in 5 cases (1.5%) and radiation necrosis in 4 cases (1.2%). In conclusion, AVMs of the BG and Thal were effectively and safely treated with the gamma knife, and stereotactic radiosurgery is a definitive alternative treatment for deep seated AVMs.",1996 Apr,1996,No to shinkei = Brain and nerve,48,4,351-6,jpn,False,,Case Reports;Comparative Study;English Abstract;Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Basal Ganglia/*blood supply;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;*Radiosurgery;Thalamus/*blood supply,,True,0.5679799418288166,False

12762874,Patient outcomes after arteriovenous malformation radiosurgical management: results based on a 5- to 14-year follow-up study.,"OBJECTIVE: Radiosurgery is commonly performed for patients with small to medium-sized arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). However, few articles present overall outcomes after one or more radiosurgical procedures, and few data are available for periods longer than 5 years after AVM radiosurgery. METHODS: Between 1990 and 1997, 144 patients underwent AVM radiosurgery and had angiographic follow-up. Of these patients, 112 (78%) had Spetzler-Martin Grade III or greater AVMs; 37 (26%) were located in the basal ganglia, thalamus, or brainstem. Twenty-six patients (18%) underwent repeat radiosurgery. The mean follow-up of 15 patients who died as a result of AVM bleeding or underwent AVM resection after the initial radiosurgery was 22 months (range, 3-47 mo); the mean follow-up of the remaining 129 patients was 86 months (range, 23-169 mo). RESULTS: Excellent (obliteration without deficit, n = 96) or good (obliteration with minor deficit, n = 9) outcomes were achieved in 73% of patients after one or more radiosurgical procedures. Twenty patients (14%) sustained major deficits (n = 15; five had obliteration) or died (n = 5) after radiosurgery. Sixteen patients (11%) had unchanged neurological examinations but persistent arteriovenous shunting. Five patients (4%) required surgery (cystoperitoneal shunting, n = 1; AVM resection, n = 4) at a median of 65 months after radiosurgery because of symptomatic cyst formation or persistent edema. The radiosurgery AVM score correlated with both excellent (R(2) = -0.93, P = 0.003) and excellent or good (R(2) = -0.92, P = 0.004) outcomes. CONCLUSION: The majority of AVM patients are protected from the risk of future hemorrhage and continue their normal daily activities after radiosurgery. Late complications requiring treatment are rare but can occur many years after patients are considered cured of their AVMs. Overall outcomes after AVM radiosurgery seem to be predicted accurately by the described method.",2003 Jun,2003,Neurosurgery,52,6,1291-6; discussion 1296-7,eng,True,10.1227/01.neu.0000064800.26214.fe,Evaluation Study;Journal Article,"Adult;Cerebral Angiography;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/mortality/*surgery;*Outcome Assessment, Health Care;*Postoperative Complications;Predictive Value of Tests;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects;Reoperation/adverse effects;Severity of Illness Index;Survival Rate;Time Factors;Treatment Failure",,True,0.5811648856227931,True
28344176,Stereotactic Radiosurgery for ARUBA (A Randomized Trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformations)-Eligible Spetzler-Martin Grade I and II Arteriovenous Malformations: A Multicenter Study.,"OBJECTIVE: ARUBA (A Randomized Trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformations) found better short-term outcomes after conservative management compared with intervention for unruptured arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). However, because Spetzler-Martin (SM) grade I-II AVMs have the lowest treatment morbidity, sufficient follow-up of these lesions may show a long-term benefit from intervention. The aim of this multicenter, retrospective cohort study is to assess the outcomes after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for ARUBA-eligible SM grade I-II AVMs. METHODS: We pooled SRS data for patients with AVM from 7 institutions and selected ARUBA-eligible SM grade I-II AVMs with ≥12 months follow-up for analysis. Favorable outcome was defined as AVM obliteration, no post-SRS hemorrhage, and no permanently symptomatic radiation-induced changes. RESULTS: The ARUBA-eligible SM grade I-II AVM cohort comprised 232 patients (mean age, 42 years). The mean nidus volume, SRS margin dose, and follow-up duration were 2.1 cm(3), 22.5 Gy, and 90.5 months, respectively. The actuarial obliteration rates at 5 and 10 years were 72% and 87%, respectively; annual post-SRS hemorrhage rate was 1.0%; symptomatic and permanent radiation-induced changes occurred in 8% and 1%, respectively; and favorable outcome was achieved in 76%. Favorable outcome was significantly more likely in patients treated with a margin dose >20 Gy (83%) versus ≤20 Gy (62%; P < 0.001). Stroke or death occurred in 10% after SRS. CONCLUSIONS: For ARUBA-eligible SM grade I-II AVMs, long-term SRS outcomes compare favorably with the natural history.

15662771,A simple method for predicting imaging-based complications following gamma knife surgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECT: The authors studied the relationship between dose planning parameters and complications in the treatment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). METHODS: There were 41 continuous unselected patients. The mean follow-up period was 19 months; the mean age was 28 years; the male/female ratio was 2.2:1.0; the median prescription dose was 25 Gy (range 14-25 Gy); the median prescription isodose was 50%. The median lesion volume was 4.4 cm3. The median lesion coverage was 93%; and the mean conformity index was 1.22. The authors found no relationship between lesion volume or integral dose and the development of the clinical effects based on the adverse radiation effects (AREs); however, there was a significant relationship between both target volume and integral dose with the development of AREs as well as the severity of the AREs. CONCLUSIONS: The integral dose could be used as a guideline for the prescription dose.

36519858,Microsurgery versus Microsurgery With Preoperative Embolization for Brain Arteriovenous Malformation Treatment: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Preoperative embolization has traditionally been regarded as a safe and effective adjunct to microsurgical treatment of brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVM). However, there is currently no high-level evidence to ascertain this presumption. OBJECTIVE: To compare the outcomes of microsurgery (MS) vs microsurgery with preoperative embolization (E + MS) in patients with bAVM through systematic review. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, and Embase. The primary outcome was bAVM obliteration. Secondary outcomes were intraoperative bleeding (mL), complications, worsened modified Rankin Scale (mRS), and mortality. The pooled proportions of outcomes were calculated through the logit transformation method. The odds ratio (OR) of categorical data and mean difference of continuous data were estimated through the Mantel-Haenszel and the inverse variance methods, respectively. RESULTS: Thirty-two studies met the eligibility criteria. One thousand eight hundred twenty-eight patients were treated by microsurgery alone, and 1088 were treated by microsurgery with preoperative embolization, respectively. The meta-analysis revealed no significant difference in AVM obliteration (94.1% vs 95.6%, OR = 1.15 [0.63-2.11], P = .65), mortality (1.7% vs 2%, OR = 0.88 [0.30-2.58], P = .82), procedural complications (18.2% vs 27.2%, OR = 0.47 [0.19-1.17], P = .10), worsened mRS (21.2% vs 18.5%, OR = 1.08 [0.33-3.54], P = .9), and intraoperative blood loss (mean difference = 182.89 [-87.76, 453.55], P = .19). CONCLUSION: The meta-analysis showed no significant difference in AVM obliteration, mortality, complications, worse mRS, and intraoperative blood loss between MS and E + MS groups.

26875716,[Clinical analysis of microsurgical treatment of giant intracranial arteriovenous malformations].,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical features and microsurgical treatment strategies of giant intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVM). METHODS: A total of 15 cases of giant intracranial AVM treated with microsurgery were analyzed retrospectively. According to the Spetzler-Martin grade, there were 4 cases of grade Ⅳ, 11 cases of grade Ⅴ. Pre-operative endovascular embolizations were carried out in 3 AVMs. RESULTS: All the included patients were confirmed as giant intracranial AVM by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), digital subtraction angiography (DSA), 3-dimensional CT angiography (3D-CTA) before surgery. All the resected tissues were sent for pathological examination, and the diagnoses were confirmed as AVM. The average operation time of the 15 patients was 10.3 ±6.9 hours. After 1-3 months, all the patients were rechecked by DSA, the large vascular malformations in 12 cases were completely resected, 3 cases had a small amount of residual further treated with gamma knife treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MRA examination indicated that the residual AVM was occluded after 12 months. Patients were followed up at 6, 12 and 24 months after operation, and assessed by Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) score: 13 cases good, 1 cases mild disability, 1 cases severe disability; the good rate was 86.6%, with no dead case.

11956940,Versatile intraoperative MRI in neurosurgery and radiology.,"BACKGROUND: Several models for the application of intra-operative magnetic resonance imaging (IMRI) have recently been reported, most of them unique. Two fundamental issues need to be addressed: optimal use of the scanner to ensure a wide base for research, development and clinical application, and an organisational model that facilitates such use. METHOD: While in our setting the IMRI project was initiated by the neurosurgeons, the need for wider use of the facilities was recognised since the beginning of the planning phase in 1996. An organisational model was developed that allowed for development of neurosurgical applications, radiological imaging, and radiological interventions and for the research and development work of the vendor. A resistive 0.23 T MR scanner was installed in a dedicated operating room environment. Unique to this scanner is the ability to turn off the magnet, allowing for normal OR activities and devices, and to turn on the magnet as needed with a relatively short six-minute ramp up time. A staged surgical technique was perfected, allowing for transfer of data to the neuronavigator outside the scanner during surgery. In neurosurgery, IMRI was used as one part of a neuronavigational system that included ultrasound imaging, intra-operative cortical stimulation during awake procedures, electrocorticography and two neuronavigators. FINDINGS: 34 neurosurgical cases included 27 brain tumour resections, 5 brain tumour biopsies, 1 extirpation of an arterio-venous malformation, and 1 haematoma evacuation. The scanner could also be used for normal clinical imaging where obese patients, children, claustophobic patients and postoperative control examinations were the major groups. The radiologists performed 110 interventions, including bone and abdominal biopsies, nerve root infiltrations and local pain therapies, with the optical needle tracking system under continuous MRI guidance. The organisational model allowed frequent use of the facilities for both neurosurgery and radiology and continuous development of the facilities. Intra-operative ultrasound was used in 20 tumour resections and in two open brain biopsies. This resulted in reduction of the number of MR imaging sessions during surgery. Five of the 27 resections were performed as awake craniotomies with cortical stimulation. For two of the resections, electrocorticography and depth electrode registrations were used. Furthermore, various non-MRI-compatible instruments and devices were used. INTERPRETATION: Intra-operative MRI is an imaging tool that can be useful especially in the context of neuronavigation. A scanner that can be turned off during surgery is particularly appropriate for neurosurgery. The concept of joint use of such facilities with other clinicians is mutually worthwhile.",2002 Mar,2002,Acta neurochirurgica,144,3,271-8; discussion 278,eng,False,10.1007/s007010200035,Journal Article,"Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Biopsy/instrumentation;Brain/pathology/surgery;Brain Diseases/diagnosis/*surgery;Brain Neoplasms/pathology/surgery;Cerebral Hemorrhage/surgery;Equipment Design;Female;Finland;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*instrumentation;Male;Middle Aged;Monitoring, Intraoperative/*instrumentation;Neuronavigation/*instrumentation;Operating Rooms/organization & administration;Patient Care Team",,False,0.040124112474550916,True
28126751,Application of Time-Resolved 3D Digital Subtraction Angiography to Plan Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformation Radiosurgery.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Time-resolved 3D-DSA (4D-DSA) enables viewing vasculature from any desired angle and time frame. We investigated whether these advantages may facilitate treatment planning and the feasibility of using 4D-DSA as a single imaging technique in AVM/dural arteriovenous fistula radiosurgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients (8 dural arteriovenous fistulas and 12 AVMs; 13 men and 7 women; mean age, 45 years; range, 18-64 years) who were scheduled for gamma knife radiosurgery were recruited (November 2014 to October 2015). An optimal volume of reconstructed time-resolved 3D volumes that defines the AVM nidus/dural arteriovenous fistula was sliced into 2D-CT-like images. The original radiosurgery treatment plan was overlaid retrospectively. The registration errors of stereotactic 4D-DSA were compared with those of integrated stereotactic imaging. AVM/dural arteriovenous fistula volumes were contoured, and disjoint and conjoint components were identified. The Wilcoxon signed rank test and the Wilcoxon rank sum test were adopted to evaluate registration errors and contoured volumes of stereotactic 4D-DSA and integration of stereotactic MR imaging and stereotactic 2D-DSA. RESULTS: Sixteen of 20 patients were successfully registered in Advanced Leksell GammaPlan Program. The registration error of stereotactic 4D-DSA was smaller than that of integrated stereotactic imaging (P = .0009). The contoured AVM volume of 4D-DSA was smaller than that contoured on the integration of MR imaging and 2D-DSA, while major inconsistencies existed in cases of dural arteriovenous fistula (P = .042 and 0.039, respectively, for measurements conducted by 2 authors). CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of stereotactic 4D-DSA data for gamma knife radiosurgery for brain AVM/dural arteriovenous fistula is feasible.

18503332,Long-term results of Gamma Knife surgery for arteriovenous malformations: 10- to 15-year follow up in patients treated with lower doses.,"OBJECT: Several adverse effects such as brain edema, necrosis, arterial stenosis, hemorrhage after obliteration, and delayed cyst formation have been reported as early and late complications of Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) for arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). These adverse effects seem to be decreased in a lower-dose treatment regimen compared with the classic higher margin doses of 25 Gy because the radiation insult to the surrounding tissue is minimized. Long-term results of lower-dose GKS for AVMs are presented. METHODS: One hundred fourteen patients with AVMs were treated with lower-dose GKS (< or = 20-Gy margin dose). There were 68 male and 46 female patients, aged 10 to 68 years (mean 35.4 years). The evaluation of AVM nidi and dose planning were performed using both angiography and MR imaging in all cases to exclude the surrounding brain tissue. The mean margin dose was 19.5 Gy. Total angiographically documented obliteration was achieved in 65 (85.5%) of 76 patients. Eleven patients underwent a second treatment, including staged treatment for large AVMs; total AVM obliteration has been achieved in six of them to date. Of 38 patients in whom no follow-up examination could be performed, 19 of them were healthy and 10 were lost from follow up. Nine patients experienced bleeding during the latency period, and four of them suffered lethal hemorrhage. Symptomatic early complications were extensive brain edema after repeated GKS in one patient and an adverse effect on the internal capsule in one. Delayed cyst formation was found in one patient as a late complication 10 years after treatment. No treatment-related death has been noted to date.

23420116,Evaluation of prognostic factors as predictor of AVMS obliteration after Gamma Knife radiosurgery.,"BACKGROUND: The reported AVMs obliteration rate after Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKS) ranges from 70 to 94 %. The objective of the present study was to assess prognostic factors predictive for cerebral AVMs obliteration in 127 patients who underwent GKS. METHODS: The AVMs were classified according to the Spetzler-Martin classification. Twenty-one cases (16.5 %) were classified as grade I, 46 cases (36.2 %) as grade II, 51 cases (40.1 %) as grade III, and nine cases (7.1 %) as grade IV-V. The AVMs were deeply located in 16.5 % of patients. The peripheral prescription dose ranged from 16 to 30 Gy (mean 22.3 Gy). The AVMs volume ranged from 0.1 to 13 cc (mean 2.7 cc). RESULTS: In 72 patients out of the 104 (69.2 %) with a radiological follow-up, MRI showed the AVM obliteration; in 54 cases (60 %) out of the 90 that performed a DSA, a complete AVM obliteration was achieved (average closure time 48.5 months). The volume of the nidus (p = 0.001), the prescription dose (p = 0.004), the 2002 Pollock-Flickinger classification (p = 0.031), and their 2008 revised classification (p = 0.025) were found to be statistically significant in predicting the probability of AVM closure. In the multivariate analysis, only the prescription dose was found to be an independent prognostic factor (p = 0.009) for AVM obliteration. CONCLUSIONS: The volume of the nidus and the prescription dose significantly influence the outcome of radiosurgical treatment. The Pollock-Flickinger classification was found to be a reliable scoring system in predicting the AVM closure and an important tool for selection of patients candidate for GKS.",2013 Apr,2013,Acta neurochirurgica,155,4,619-26,eng,True,10.1007/s00701-013-1631-2;10.1007/s00701-013-1631-2,Journal Article,Adult;Cerebral Angiography/methods;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/classification/*diagnosis/diagnostic;Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods;Male;Middle Aged;*Predictive Value of Tests;Prognosis;Radiosurgery/*methods,,True,0.8003071273517064,True
24160482,Stereotactic radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations of the cerebellum.,"OBJECT: Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the posterior fossa have an aggressive natural history and propensity for hemorrhage. Although the cerebellum accounts for the majority of the posterior fossa volume, there is a paucity of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) outcome data for AVMs of this region. The authors sought to evaluate the long-term outcomes and risks of cerebellar AVM radiosurgery. METHODS: This single-institution retrospective analysis reviewed the authors' experience with Gamma Knife surgery during the period 1987-2007. During this time 64 patients (median age 47 years, range 8-75 years) underwent SRS for a cerebellar AVM. Forty-seven patients (73%) presented with an intracranial hemorrhage. The median target volume was 3.85 cm(3) (range 0.2-12.5 cm(3)), and the median marginal dose was 21 Gy (range 15-25 Gy). RESULTS: Arteriovenous malformation obliteration was confirmed by MRI or angiography in 40 patients at a median follow-up of 73 months (range 4-255 months). The actuarial rates of total obliteration were 53% at 3 years, 69% at 4 years, and 76% at 5 and 10 years. Elevated obliteration rates were statistically higher in patients who underwent AVM SRS without prior embolization (p = 0.005). A smaller AVM volume was also associated with a higher rate of obliteration (p = 0.03). Four patients (6%) sustained a hemorrhage during the latency period and 3 died. The cumulative rates of AVM hemorrhage after SRS were 6% at 1, 5, and 10 years. This correlated with an overall annual hemorrhage rate of 2.0% during the latency interval. One patient experienced a hemorrhage 9 years after confirmed MRI and angiographic obliteration.

12371592,Combined embolization and microsurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformation.,"Thirty-seven of 396 patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) were treated by preoperative embolization and surgical excision in our medical center between 1991 and 1997. The AVMs were Spetzler-Martin grade I in six, grade II in 11, grade III in 12, grade IV in four, and Grade V in four. A total of 69 embolization procedures were performed using estrogen alcohol and polyvinyl acetate as liquid embolization materials. AVM grades improved following embolization in 10 patients. Three hemorrhages occurred several days after the final embolization, probably due to hemodynamic stress on the unoccluded perforating feeders or drainer occlusion. Surgical resection was performed under guidance of intraoperative digital subtraction angiography. Although the AVMs were excised totally in one stage with no major neurological deficits, normal perfusion pressure breakthrough occurred in a patient with prominent collateral circulation of the AVM which developed after the main feeder embolization. Preoperative staged embolization with estrogen alcohol and polyvinyl acetate is effective to expand the surgical indication and to achieve complete resection of difficult AVMs. Direct surgery should be performed as soon as possible if hemodynamic changes are observed following embolization.",2002 Sep,2002,Neurologia medico-chirurgica,42,9,372-8; discussion 379,eng,False,JST.JSTAGE/nmc/42.372;10.2176/nmc.42.372,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Angiography, Digital Subtraction;Cerebral Angiography;Child;Combined Modality Therapy;*Embolization, Therapeutic;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Male;*Microsurgery;Middle Aged;Preoperative Care;Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies",,False,0.12877114276631435,True
1869468,Fractionated radiotherapy of small inoperable lesions of the brain using a non-invasive stereotactic frame.,"Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and benign or low grade, small malignant tumors can be treated by stereotactic radiotherapy in a single fraction. This report describes a technique for stereotactic treatment of small lesions using conventional, fractionated, photon beam irradiation. The Laitinen's stereoadapter, non-invasive head frame was used. This device was tested for accuracy by serial mountings and found to be accurate within 1 mm. The accuracy of the dose delivered was within 2%. Adaptation of this device to the linear accelerator required the design of secondary circular collimators which decreased the penumbra from 3-4 mm to 2-3 mm. The dose fall off outside the target volume is steep enough when using two non-coplanar arcs (90 to 10% within 1 cm). Thermoluminescent dosimetry (TLD) in a humanoid phantom showed good correlation with the calculated dose. This system permits delivery of fractionated radiation therapy to small volumes, easily and accurately, under stereotactic conditions.",1991 Aug,1991,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",21,3,749-55,eng,False,0360-3016(91)90695-Z;10.1016/0360-3016(91)90695-z,Case Reports;Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Brain Neoplasms/*radiotherapy;Child;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*radiotherapy;Male;Middle Aged;Particle Accelerators;*Radiotherapy Dosage;*Stereotaxic Techniques,,False,0.06627447700319794,True
31064679,Assessing the volume of large cerebral arteriovenous malformations: Can the ABC/2 formula reliably predict true volume?,"BACKGROUND: Outcomes of stereotactic radiosurgery in the treatment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are volume-dependent. The ability to estimate AVM volume has significant value in guiding AVM management. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether AVM volume measurement calculated from the ABC/2 formula is accurate compared to volume calculated by a computer-assisted planimetric method for large AVMs. METHODS: Retrospective review of 42 intracranial AVMs >3 cm in diameter that underwent treatment with dose-staged hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT) from 2001 to 2018. Two raters independently measured pre- and post-HSRT volumes using both the ABC/2 formula and computer-assisted planimetry in a blinded fashion. Inter-rater reliability was assessed by calculation of intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Absolute volumes and percent volume change following HSRT as determined using the two methods were compared using paired t-tests, linear regression, and Bland-Altman plot analyses. RESULTS: The ICC between the 2 raters for planimetric and ABC/2 volumes was 0.859 and 0.799, respectively. ABC/2 volumes, 26.1 ± 26.6 cm(3), were statistically smaller than planimetric volumes, 28.6 ± 27.1 cm(3) (P = .008). Despite differences, the two methods were highly correlated (R(2) = 0.904, linear regression). The percent volume change following HSRT was significantly greater with the ABC/2 method than compared to planimetry (P = .009). CONCLUSION: The ABC/2 and planimetric methods are reproducible for measuring cerebral AVM volumes. Although the ABC/2 method of volume estimation underestimates planimetric AVM volume, the high correlation between the two suggests utility of the ABC/2 method if one understands its limits, particularly with respect to estimating change in AVM volume after treatment.",2019 Jul,2019,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society,65,,1-5,eng,False,S0967-5868(19)30546-6;10.1016/j.jocn.2019.04.038;S0967-5868(19)30546-6;10.1016/j.jocn.2019.04.038,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Female;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted/*methods;Imaging, Three-Dimensional/methods;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*pathology/surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Neuroimaging/*methods;Radiation Dose Hypofractionation;Radiosurgery/methods;Reproducibility of Results;Retrospective Studies;Tomography, X-Ray Computed;Treatment Outcome",ABC/2;Cerebral arteriovenous malformations;Planimetry;Radiosurgery;Volume,False,0.32889363183734344,True
11013106,Strategic embolisation for successful resection of a large cerebral arteriovenous malformation.,"The risks accompanied by the treatment of cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) are still cumulative despite recent progress in available treatment options. Pre-operative embolisation is one such option, however, it seldom makes the surgical resection difficult. The excessive embolised nidus makes the surgical resection difficult because it cannot be compressed during the resection surgery and embolised nidus as a 'glue ball' with marginal hypervascular territory is most difficult to remove. The aim of pre-operative embolisation for successful surgical resection is to put glue into the marginal part of the nidus so as to make a cleavage between the surrounding normal tissues. Remaining feedings via the dilatated leptomeningeal anastomoses from surrounding normal cortical arteries do not interfere with the resection and can be eliminated easily by coagulating the pia matter around the nidus. Strategic planning with regard to the systemic course of treatment, including the manner of resection, is important for effective pre-operative embolisation.",2000 Sep,2000,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society,7 Suppl 1,,86-7,eng,False,S0967586800907197;10.1054/jocn.2000.0719,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Adult;Combined Modality Therapy;*Embolization, Therapeutic/methods;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/surgery/*therapy;Male;Radiosurgery",,False,0.045989790093521825,True
