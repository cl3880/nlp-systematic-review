11143247,First clinical experience with the automatic positioning system and Leksell gamma knife Model C. Technical note.,"In May of 1999, the first Leksell Model C gamma knife was installed at the Gamma Knife Zentrum in Krefeld, Germany. The authors recount their experience with this latest technical gamma knife development. Until the end of 1999, extensive physical and technical tests were performed and the system's hardware and software were continuously improved and adapted to the user's needs. By the end of 1999, 163 GKSs had been performed using the new functionality of the Model C in manual or ""trunnion"" mode. The trunnions, the two parts of the system that fix the patient headframe to the gamma knife when the isocenter positions, are checked manually. During the same period the new automatic positioning system (APS) was extensively tested and refined so that the first APS treatment could be performed in January 2000. Fifty GKSs have been performed with the APS capability of the Model C. It was possible to use APS alone in 74% of surgeries whereas in 14% some shots were given with APS and some with trunnions. In 12%, GKS was scheduled and planned for APS, but due to unexpected technical (6%) or mechanical (6%) reasons the treatment had to be performed manually. At present there are some spatial restrictions with Model C in APS mode when compared with the Model B. The most significant restriction is the narrow space for the patient's shoulders, especially when deep-seated lesions are treated. Through mechanical changes of the APS motor housing and some modifications of and to the motor driven couch adjustment, these limitations will be reduced in the future. The APS treatment runs smoothly and fast. In no case did any relevant safety error occur during GKS. The more stringent mechanical limitations of the APS compared with the Model B means that frame placement on the head is more critical than before.",2000 Dec,2000,Journal of neurosurgery,93 Suppl 3,,193-7,eng,False,10.3171/jns.2000.93.supplement,Comparative Study;Journal Article,Brain Neoplasms/secondary/*surgery;*Computer Systems;Equipment Design;Head Protective Devices;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Radiosurgery/*instrumentation;Stereotaxic Techniques/*instrumentation,
11143254,A quality factor to compare the dosimetry of gamma knife radiosurgery and intensity-modulated radiation therapy quantitatively as a function of target volume and shape. Technical note.,"The authors have developed a quality factor (QF) to compare gamma knife radiosurgery, linear accelerator radiosurgery, and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) dosimetry. This QF relates the percentage of target covered (PTC) by the prescription radiation isodose, target volume (V(T)), and enclosed tissue volume, which receives greater than a particular dose (V(X)): QF(X) = PTCxV(T)/V(X). The authors investigated target shape independent of volume in predicting radiosurgical complication rates. Plastic targets of a defined volume (0.2, 0.5, 1.5, and 10 cm3) and four increasingly complex shapes (spherical, ellipsoid, simulated arteriovenous malformation [AVM], and horseshoe) were created. Dosimetry was studied on the Leksell GammaPlan, Adac/Pinnacle, and Nomos Corvus workstations. The dosimetry of a new 4 mm x 10-mm IMRT collimator array (the Nomos Beak) not yet validated for use in our clinical practice was studied. Particularly for larger targets, the gamma knife and IMRT Beak plans show similar conformality (QF assuming 15-Gy volume [QF15]). Particularly for small and round targets the gamma knife plan quality is significantly higher (QF assuming 12-Gy volume [QF12]). As V(T) and complexity increase, the IMRT Beak QF12 approaches that of the gamma knife. The QF12 of gamma knife dosimetry has an inverse correlation with target shape complexity independent of V(T). At a prescription dose of 15 Gy to the target margin, the QF15 is a conformality index. The 12-Gy volume (volume enclosed by 12-Gy surface/volume receiving at least 12 Gy) estimates the radiosurgical normal tissue complication rate for AVMs. When the target is well covered, the QF12 is inversely proportional to the complication risk and is a measure of the plan quality.",2000 Dec,2000,Journal of neurosurgery,93 Suppl 3,,228-32,eng,False,10.3171/jns.2000.93.supplement,Comparative Study;Journal Article,"Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Phantoms, Imaging;*Quality Assurance, Health Care;Radiosurgery/*methods;Reproducibility of Results",
11143253,Comparison of geometric distortion in digital angiography with and without a correction program. Technical note.,"This study was conducted to evaluate the geometric distortion of angiographic images created from a commonly used digital x-ray imaging system and the performance of a commercially available distortion-correction computer program. A 12 x 12 x 12-cm wood phantom was constructed. Lead shots, 2 mm in diameter, were attached to the surfaces of the phantom. The phantom was then placed inside the angiographic localizer. Cut films (frontal and lateral analog films) of the phantom were obtained. The films were analyzed using GammaPlan target series 4.12. The same procedure was repeated with a digital x-ray imaging system equipped with a computer program to correct the geometric distortion. The distortion of the two sets of digital images was evaluated using the coordinates of the lead shots from the cut films as references. The coordinates of all lead shots obtained from digital images and corrected by the computer program coincided within 0.5 mm of those obtained from cut films. The average difference is 0.28 mm with a standard deviation of 0.01 mm. On the other hand, the coordinates obtained from digital images with and without correction can differ by as much as 3.4 mm. The average difference is 1.53 mm, with a standard deviation of 0.67 mm. The investigated computer program can reduce the geometric distortion of digital images from a commonly used x-ray imaging system to less than 0.5 mm. Therefore, they are suitable for the localization of arteriovenous malformations and other vascular targets in gamma knife radiosurgery.",2000 Dec,2000,Journal of neurosurgery,93 Suppl 3,,223-7,eng,False,10.3171/jns.2000.93.supplement,Comparative Study;Journal Article,"Angiography, Digital Subtraction/*instrumentation;Artifacts;Cerebral Angiography/*instrumentation;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Phantoms, Imaging;Quality Assurance, Health Care;Radiosurgery/*instrumentation;*Software",
11143251,Image registration and calculation of a biologically effective dose for multisession radiosurgical treatments. Technical note.,"The purpose of this study was to develop techniques for registering image sets associated with staged or multifraction radiosurgical treatments of large targets with the Leksell gamma knife to transform shot coordinates between treatment sessions and produce cumulative dose distributions and to investigate the theoretical biological effects of such protracted treatments by means of such concepts as the linear-quadratic model and biologically effective dose. An image registration technique based on normalized mutual information was adapted to produce one fused-image study from an imaging series acquired during distinct treatment sessions. A spreadsheet computer program was developed to determine coordinate transformations between the associated stereotactic coordinate systems based on digitized coordinates of fiducial markers appearing on the fused images. Coordinates of shots used during one treatment session could then be transformed to the stereotactic space of another session, and cumulative dose distributions could be computed. The procedure was applied to the two-stage treatment of a giant arteriovenous malformation (AVM). Overall uncertainty in each transformed shot position is approximately 0.7 mm. An effective single-fraction dose (D(eff)) was defined and computed for the two-stage AVM treatment. The simple summed dose distribution was compared with the D(eff) distribution. Because dose values differ significantly in overlap regions between the individual distributions, the clinical usefulness of the simple cumulative distribution is dubious. It may be useful for a future update of the GammaPlan treatment planning software to generate effective single-session dose distributions for such cases.",2000 Dec,2000,Journal of neurosurgery,93 Suppl 3,,208-18,eng,False,10.3171/jns.2000.93.supplement,Journal Article,"Humans;*Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/*surgery;*Magnetic Resonance Imaging;*Radiosurgery;Reoperation;Reproducibility of Results;Software",
11143227,Gamma knife radiosurgery as a single treatment modality for large cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECT: A consecutive series of 240 patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) treated by gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS) between March 1993 and March 1999 was evaluated to assess the efficacy and safety of radiosurgery for cerebral AVMs larger than 10 cm3 in volume. METHODS: Seventy-six patients (32%) had AVM nidus volumes of more than 10 cm3. During radiosurgery, targeting and delineation of AVM nidi were based on integrated stereotactic magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and x-ray angiography. The radiation treatment was performed using multiple small isocenters to improve conformity of the treatment volume. The mean dose inside the nidus was kept between 20 Gy and 24 Gy. The margin dose ranged between 15 to 18 Gy placed at the 55 to 60% isodose centers. Follow up ranged from 12 to 73 months. There was complete obliteration in 24 patients with an AVM volume of more than 10 cm3 and in 91 patients with an AVM volume of less than 10 cm3. The latency for complete obliteration in larger-volume AVMs was significantly longer. In Kaplan-Meier analysis, the complete obliteration rate in 40 months was 77% in AVMs with volumes between 10 to 15 cm3, as compared with 25% for AVMs with a volume of more than 15 cm3. In the latter, the obliteration rate had increased to 58% at 50 months. The follow-up MR images revealed that large-volume AVMs had higher incidences of postradiosurgical edema, petechiae, and hemorrhage. The bleeding rate before cure was 9.2% (seven of 76) for AVMs with a volume exceeding 10 cm3, and 1.8% (three of 164) for AVMs with a volume less than 10 cm3. Although focal edema was more frequently found in large AVMs, most of the cases were reversible. Permanent neurological complications were found in 3.9% (three of 76) of the patients with an AVM volume of more than 10 cm3, 3.8% (three of 80) of those with AVM volume of 3 to 10 cm3, and 2.4% (two of 84) of those with an AVM volume less than 3 cm3. These differences in complications rate were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Recent improvement of radiosurgery in conjunction with stereotactic MR targeting and multiplanar dose planning has permitted the treatment of larger AVMs. It is suggested that gamma knife radiosurgery is effective for treating AVMs as large as 30 cm3 in volume with an acceptable risk.",2000 Dec,2000,Journal of neurosurgery,93 Suppl 3,,113-9,eng,True,10.3171/jns.2000.93.supplement,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Cerebral Angiography;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Angiography;Male;Middle Aged;Postoperative Complications/diagnosis;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies",
11143225,Analysis of the causes of treatment failure in gamma knife radiosurgery for intracranial arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECT: The authors sought to analyze causes for treatment failure following gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS) for intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), in cases in which the nidus could still be observed on angiography 3 years postsurgery. METHODS: Four hundred fifteen patients with AVMs were treated with GKS between April 1990 and March 2000. The mean margin dose was 23.6 Gy (range 10-25 Gy), and the mean nidus volume was 5.3 cm3 (range 0.4-41.7 cm3). The KULA treatment planning system and conventional subtraction angiography were used in treatment planning. One hundred twenty-three of these 415 patients underwent follow-up angiography after GKS. After 3 years the nidus was totally obliterated in 98 patients (80%) and partial obliteration was noted in the remaining 25. There were several reasons why complete obliteration was not achieved in all cases: inadequate nidus definition in four patients, changes in the size and location of the nidus in five patients due to recanalization after embolization or reexpansion after hematoma reabsorption, a large AVM volume in five patients, a suboptimal radiation dose to the thalamic and basal ganglia in eight patients, and radioresistance in three patients with an intranidal fistula. CONCLUSIONS: The causes of failed GKS for treatment of AVMs seen on 3-year follow-up angiograms include inadequate nidus definition, large nidus volume, suboptimal radiation dose, recanalization/reexpansion, and radioresistance associated with an intranidal fistula.",2000 Dec,2000,Journal of neurosurgery,93 Suppl 3,,104-6,eng,True,10.3171/jns.2000.93.supplement,Journal Article,"Angiography, Digital Subtraction;Cerebral Angiography;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Postoperative Complications/diagnostic imaging/*etiology;*Radiosurgery;Risk Factors;Treatment Failure",
11143224,Gamma knife radiosurgery for brainstem arteriovenous malformations: preliminary results.,"OBJECT: This study was undertaken to assess the efficacy and safety of gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS) for the treatment of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) located within the brainstem. METHODS: The results of GKS performed in 87 patients with brainstem AVMs at two centers with experienced physicians are reviewed. The mean patient age was 37 years and the population included 19 children. The male/female ratio was 56:31. The malformation was located in the upper brainstem in 52 patients. Seventy-four percent of the patients had suffered a hemorrhage before GKS. For 70% of the patients no other treatment had been proposed before GKS. The mean AVM volume was 1.3 cm3. The lesions were treated with one to eight isocenters, with a margin dose ranging between 11.5 Gy and 30 Gy. The mean clinical follow-up period was 3.2 years. Ninety-five percent of the patients improved or remained neurologically stable. Rebleeding occurred in three patients at 3, 6, and 16 months, respectively, after GKS. Two patients in whom rebleeding occured recovered, and one died. The AVM obliteration rate was 63% at 2 years and 73% at 3 years after GKS. A second GKS was performed in six patients in whom only partial obliteration was demonstrated on angiography 3 years after the first procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Gamma knife radiosurgery may be a valuable first-choice therapy for the treatment of AVMs located within the brainstem.",2000 Dec,2000,Journal of neurosurgery,93 Suppl 3,,102-3,eng,False,10.3171/jns.2000.93.supplement,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Brain Stem/*blood supply;Cerebral Hemorrhage/surgery;Child;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome",
11143226,Staged radiosurgical treatment for large benign cerebral lesions.,"OBJECT: Large brain lesions are considered unamenable to gamma knife treatment because of possible adverse effects. The proximity of eloquent brain to a target location, including some arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), still poses a challenge to the neurosurgeon. Because meningiomas and AVMs often show a slow or absent growth rate, partial radiosurgical treatment in cases with risk of unacceptable surgery-related morbidity is an alternative. The authors evaluated the results of staged treatment. METHODS: Since April 1992, 12 patients suffering from large benign tumors (meningiomas) and seven with AVMs considered inoperable underwent gamma knife radiosurgery in staged procedures. All patients with tumors underwent primary open surgery for partial removal of recurrent growth and subsequent radiosurgical treatment. Four men and eight women ranging in age from 26 to 73 years harbored tumors that ranged in volume from 19 to 90 cm3. Marginal dose ranged from 10 to 25 Gy prescribed in the 30 to 50% isodose. The time interval between the radiosurgical treatments varied from 1 to 8 months. Follow up ranged from 5 and 89 months. Three female and four male patients (age range 10-48 years) had undergone previous AVM embolization and were treated with margin doses of 18 to 22 Gy in the 40 to 50% isodose. The volume range of these AVMs was 11 to 25 cm3. The time interval between radiosurgical treatments ranged from 5 to 36 months. The mean follow up was 22.6 months. Neurological follow-up examinations showed clinical improvement in 11 patients (58%), whereas five (26%) remained unchanged. Among tumor patients no deterioration or further tumor growth was observed. Tumor necrosis demonstrated noticed in five patients (26%). One patient with an AVM suffered from seizures and hemiparesis. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging of the residual nidus disclosed no rebleeding. CONCLUSIONS: For selected patients with large benign lesions staged gamma knife radiosurgery could be an alternative, as evidenced by the authors' series in which there was no mortality and low incidence morbidity.",2000 Dec,2000,Journal of neurosurgery,93 Suppl 3,,107-12,eng,False,10.3171/jns.2000.93.supplement,Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Child;Disease Progression;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Meningeal Neoplasms/diagnosis/*surgery;Meningioma/diagnosis/*surgery;Middle Aged;Postoperative Complications/diagnosis;*Radiosurgery;Reoperation,
12507078,Impact on the quality of life of patients with arteriovenous malformations during the latent interval between gamma knife radiosurgery and lesion obliteration.,"OBJECT: The aim of this study was to measure the quality of life (QOL) in patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) receiving gamma knife treatment before total AVM obliteration. Quality of life was assessed as it related to the knowledge of rebleeding risk during the waiting period, AVM symptoms, and previous bleeding. METHODS: Thirty-nine patients age 18 years or older without other medical problems were asked to complete a questionnaire that included demographic variables, immediate effect of gamma knife radiosurgery, symptoms of AVM, previous hemorrhage, and the Duke-University of North Carolina Health Profile (63 items). CONCLUSIONS: The QOL of patients with cerebral AVM during the waiting period after undergoing gamma knife treatment was affected by irreversible physical disabilities rather than the knowledge of hemorrhage risk and bleeding experience.",2002 Dec,2002,Journal of neurosurgery,97,5 Suppl,471-3,eng,False,10.3171/jns.2002.97.supplement,Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*psychology/*surgery;Intracranial Hemorrhages/psychology/surgery;Patient Education as Topic;Perception;*Quality of Life;Radiosurgery/*psychology;Social Adjustment;Surveys and Questionnaires;Waiting Lists,
12507079,Hemorrhage risks and obliteration rates of arteriovenous malformations after gamma knife radiosurgery.,"OBJECT: The purpose of this study was to analyze the risk of hemorrhage and the obliteration rate after treatment of patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). METHODS: Between 1991 and 1995, 115 patients were treated using gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS). Surgical planning was based on angiograms and three-dimensional images. The angiographic features of the AVMs and the risk factors for hemorrhage were then evaluated. Hemorrhages occurred in eight patients (7%) 7 to 42 months after GKS. Based on AVM morphology, the rates of hemorrhage were five (7.6%) of 66 for AVMs with a single draining vein, seven (14%) of 66 for AVMs with deep drainage, four (26.7%) of 15 for AVMs with a varix, four (28.6%) of 14 for AVMs with venous obstruction, eight (17.0%) of 47 for high-flow (shunt- and mixed-type) AVMs, and five (35.7%) of 14 for large AVMs with a volume of more than 10 cm3. No hemorrhages were observed in association with low-flow (moyamoya-type) AVMs in this series. Total AVM obliteration was achieved in 81.3% of 80 patients who underwent angiography. The obliteration rate was 91.3% for moyamoyatype AVMs and 67.6% for shunt- and mixed-type AVMs. Early obliteration within 12 months was achieved in 63% of the moyamoya-type AVMs. CONCLUSIONS: Moyamoya-type AVMs seem to be at risk for post-GKS hemorrhage. Intravascular embolization should be considered prior to GKS for mixed- and shunt-type AVMs in an attempt to reduce the hemodynamic stress and thereby decrease the risk of hemorrhage.",2002 Dec,2002,Journal of neurosurgery,97,5 Suppl,474-6,eng,True,10.3171/jns.2002.97.supplement,Journal Article,Adult;Aged;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*epidemiology/*surgery;Intracranial Hemorrhages/*epidemiology;Male;Middle Aged;Postoperative Complications/*epidemiology;*Radiosurgery;Risk Factors;Treatment Outcome,
12507077,Can magnetic resonance imaging alone accurately define the arteriovenous nidus for gamma knife radiosurgery?,"OBJECT: Current radiosurgical treatment of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) relies on planning protocols that integrate data from both magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and stereotactic angiography studies. Angiography, however, is invasive and associated with a small but well-defined risk of neurological and systemic complications. Magnetic resonance imaging, on the other hand, is noninvasive with multiplanar capability, demonstrates good anatomical detail, and has been shown to be superior to angiography in the delineation of selected AVMs. METHODS: In this study, MR imaging-related accuracy of defining the AVM nidus in gamma knife radiosurgery is investigated using only T1- and T2-weighted sequences. CONCLUSIONS: Little interobserver variability was observed and AVM nidi, as demonstrated on T1- and T2-weighted MR images, were well correlated in terms of size. The displacement of the new target, however, from the original nidus, was not predictable and occasionally was significant, thus precluding safe radiosurgical planning.",2002 Dec,2002,Journal of neurosurgery,97,5 Suppl,464-70,eng,False,10.3171/jns.2002.97.supplement,Journal Article,Cerebral Angiography;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*pathology/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*standards/statistics & numerical data;Observer Variation;Predictive Value of Tests;*Radiosurgery;Reproducibility of Results,
12507095,Experimentally determined three-dimensional dose distributions in small complex targets.,"OBJECT: The purpose of the paper is to describe a workable three-dimensional dosimetry system for use in quality assurance programs of departments in which radiosurgery is performed. METHODS: A system was developed on the basis of radiochromatic films. The experimental findings of the measured dose distributions for small complex-shaped targets, within a specially designed phantom, are described and compared with the same parameters calculated from the corresponding dose plan. The following parameters were determined for 83 patients with irregularly shaped targets who underwent gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS): target volume; dose-volume histograms of the target; 12-Gy, 15-Gy, and 18-Gy volumes; dose plan conformity; dose fall profiles in all dimensions to 50% of the prescription dose; and a quality factor (QF) to evaluate the adequacy of a GKS plan or treatment. The precise function and accuracy of the developed measuring device is shown and it demonstrated the expected steep dose falloff outside the irregularly shaped targets in all directions. The dose falloff was of the order of > 3 Gy/mm and the values of the QF were in the range between 0.5 and 0.9. CONCLUSIONS: A comparison with data from the literature shows that at least for small targets (< 2 cm3 and < 2.5 cm3) simulated within a head phantom, the dose gradient is significantly steeper in all directions than when using alternative treatment devices in radiosurgery and the overall QF is superior in most of the cases.",2002 Dec,2002,Journal of neurosurgery,97,5 Suppl,551-5,eng,False,10.3171/jns.2002.97.supplement,Journal Article,"Adenoma/surgery;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery;Meningeal Neoplasms/*surgery;Meningioma/*surgery;Neuroma, Acoustic/surgery;Phantoms, Imaging;Pituitary Neoplasms/surgery;Radiation Dosage;Radiosurgery/*methods",
12507076,Effect of a single high-dose gamma irradiation on cultured cells in human cerebral arteriovenous malformation.,"OBJECT: The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect of single high-dose gamma irradiation at a cellular biological level on tissue cultures obtained in patients who underwent surgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM). METHODS: The cell proliferation indices and changes in activation of p53, p21Waf-1, and mdm-2 were determined. Additionally, immunohistochemical investigations for vimentin, desmin, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), glial fibrillary acidic protein, Factor VIII-related antigen (F-VIII), cytokeratin, S100, and transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) were performed on cultured AVM cells after a single high-dose irradiation. Normal human brain microvessel endothelial (HBE) cells and aortic smooth muscle cells served as controls. The proliferation index decreased on the 5th day after irradiation and remained depressed over the observation period in the irradiated AVM cultures. The p53, p21Waf-1, and mdm-2 messenger RNA measurements showed considerable elevation both in AVM cultures and HBE cells after 15-Gy irradiation, which indicated apoptosis. Immunohistochemistry revealed strong vimentin positivity in the nonirradiated cultures, which gradually decreased in the irradiated cultures. Transforming growth factor-beta positivity was demonstrated in the irradiated specimens, indicating transformation of fibroblastic cells into activated myofibroblastic elements. This transformation was confirmed by demonstrating elevated SMA expression as well in the radiation-treated fibroblasts. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of TGFbeta and alpha-SMA activity in the irradiated AVM cells suggests that along with the genetically confirmed apoptotic activity, fibroblast transformation into myofibroblasts might be one of the mechanisms leading to shrinkage and obliteration of AVMs after single high-dose gamma irradiation.",2002 Dec,2002,Journal of neurosurgery,97,5 Suppl,459-63,eng,False,10.3171/jns.2002.97.supplement,Journal Article,"Actins/analysis;Antimetabolites/pharmacokinetics;Bromodeoxyuridine/pharmacokinetics;Cell Division/radiation effects;Cells, Cultured;Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21;Cyclins/genetics;Fibroblasts/chemistry/cytology/*radiation effects;Gamma Rays;Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations;*Nuclear Proteins;Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics;Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2;RNA, Messenger/analysis;Radiosurgery;Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics;Vimentin/analysis",

32423182,Radiosurgery for Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM) : Current Treatment Strategy and Radiosurgical Technique for Large Cerebral AVM.,"Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are congenital anomalies of the cerebrovascular system. AVM harbors 2.2% annual hemorrhage risk in unruptured cases and 4.5% annual hemorrhage risk of previously ruptured cases. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) have been shown excellent treatment outcomes for patients with small- to moderated sized AVM which can be achieved in 80-90% complete obliteration rate with a 2-3 years latency period. The most important factors are associated with obliteration after SRS is the radiation dose to the AVM. In our institutional clinical practice, now 22 Gy (50% isodose line) dose of radiation has been used for treatment of cerebral AVM in single-session radiosurgery. However, dose-volume relationship can be unfavorable for large AVMs when treated in a single-session radiosurgery, resulting high complication rates for effective dose. Thus, various strategies should be considered to treat large AVM. The role of pre-SRS embolization is permanent volume reduction of the nidus and treat high-risk lesion such as AVM-related aneurysm and high-flow arteriovenous shunt. Various staging technique of radiosurgery including volume-staged radiosurgery, hypofractionated radiotherapy and dose-staged radiosurgery are possible option for large AVM. The incidence of post-radiosurgery complication is varied, the incidence rate of radiological post-radiosurgical complication has been reported 30-40% and symptomatic complication rate was reported from 8.1% to 11.8%. In the future, novel therapy which incorporate endovascular treatment using liquid embolic material and new radiosurgical technique such as gene or cytokine-targeted radio-sensitization should be needed.",2020 Jul,2020,Journal of Korean Neurosurgical Society,63,4,415-426,eng,False,10.3340/jkns.2020.0008;jkns.2020.0008;jkns-2020-0008;10.3340/jkns.2020.0008,Journal Article,,Arteriovenous malformations;Complication;Radiosurgery
38648282,Most Promising Approaches to Improve Brain AVM Management: ARISE I Consensus Recommendations.,"Brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) are complex, and rare arteriovenous shunts that present with a wide range of signs and symptoms, with intracerebral hemorrhage being the most severe. Despite prior societal position statements, there is no consensus on the management of these lesions. ARISE (Aneurysm/bAVM/cSDH Roundtable Discussion With Industry and Stroke Experts) was convened to discuss evidence-based approaches and enhance our understanding of these complex lesions. ARISE identified the need to develop scales to predict the risk of rupture of bAVMs, and the use of common data elements to perform prospective registries and clinical studies. Additionally, the group underscored the need for comprehensive patient management with specialized centers with expertise in cranial and spinal microsurgery, neurological endovascular surgery, and stereotactic radiosurgery. The collection of prospective multicenter data and gross specimens was deemed essential for improving bAVM characterization, genetic evaluation, and phenotyping. Finally, bAVMs should be managed within a multidisciplinary framework, with clinical studies and research conducted collaboratively across multiple centers, harnessing the collective expertise and centralization of resources.",2024 May,2024,Stroke,55,5,1449-1463,eng,False,10.1161/STROKEAHA.124.046725;10.1161/STROKEAHA.124.046725,"Consensus Development Conference;Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Humans;Cerebral Hemorrhage/therapy;Endovascular Procedures/methods;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/therapy;Radiosurgery/methods,aneurysm;arteriovenous malformation;embolization;imaging;liquid embolic
28945054,Intracranial stereotactic radiosurgery.,"Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is the use of a single high dose of radiation, stereotactically directed to an intracranial region of interest, in order to create a lesion or obliterate a preexisting one. This technology has evolved over the years into the use of multiple radiation sources oriented at a variety of angles, thus permitting the creation of various treatment target shapes. This allows for non-open surgical treatment of intracranial pathologies, which significantly decreases the risk of morbidity. The destruction of pathological tissue following radiosurgery is a stepwise process that involves a number of different stages, beginning with the necrotic stage, followed by the resorption stage, and concluding with the glial scar formation stage. There are currently a number of different delivery methods of SRS, including linear accelerators, Gamma Knife units, and charged particle methods (Bragg-peak and plateau-beam). Various intracranial lesions exhibit different responses to radiosurgery; however, most lesions of appropriate size tend to respond favorably. Radiosurgery is used today in the treatment of brain metastases, meningiomas, vestibular schwannomas, sellar and suprasellar lesions, and arteriovenous malformations. SRS is widely used to treat functional conditions, such as trigeminal neuralgia and intractable tremor. The treatment of intracranial lesions with radiosurgery can result in undesirable effects on the adjacent normal brain, resulting in adverse radiation effects. The distinction between tumor progression and adverse radiation effects can be challenging but is aided by various imaging modalities. Treatment options for this condition include observation, corticosteroids, pentoxifylline and vitamin E, bevacizumab, laser-interstitial thermal therapy, and surgical resection.",2019 Feb,2019,Journal of neurosurgical sciences,63,1,61-82,eng,False,10.23736/S0390-5616.17.04210-2;S0390-5616.17.04210-2;10.23736/S0390-5616.17.04210-2,Journal Article;Review,Arteriovenous Fistula/*therapy;Brain Neoplasms/*therapy;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*therapy;Radiosurgery/adverse effects/*methods;Tremor/*therapy;Trigeminal Neuralgia/*therapy,

35074096,Intracranial arteriovenous malformations.,"The treatment of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) has evolved over the last 10 years. It is now possible to see that obliteration continues for up to 10 years and that the final obliteration rate may be between 85% and 90%. Improved imaging has made the treatment more efficient and has reduced the complications. It is possible to treat larger AVMs in a single session than was previously thought possible without increases in the complication rates. In addition, treatments of larger lesions can be staged.

38700684,Treatment of Brain Arteriovenous Malformations.,"Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are a rare entity of vascular anomalies, characteristic of anatomical shunting where arterial blood directly flows into the venous circulation. The main aim of the active treatment policy of brain AVMs is the prevention of haemorrhage. There are well-established treatment strategies that continually improve in their safety and efficacy, primarily due to the advances in imaging modalities, targeted and novel techniques, the development of alternative treatment approaches, and even better experience with the disease itself. There are interesting imaging novelties that may be prospectively applicable in the decision-making and planning of the most effective treatment approach for individual patients with intracranial AVM. Surgery is often considered the first-line treatment; however, each patient should be evaluated individually, and the risks of the active treatment policy should not overcome the benefits of the spontaneous natural history of the disease. All treatment modalities, i.e., surgery, radiosurgery, endovascular embolization, and observation, are justified but need to be meticulously selected for each individual patient in order to deliver the best treatment outcome.

37026353,Radiological Parameters for Gamma Knife Radiosurgery.,"Accurate lesion targeting is the essence of stereotactic radiosurgery. With the currently available imaging modalities, scanning has become quick and robust providing a high degree of spatial resolution resulting in optimal contrast between normal and abnormal tissues. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) forms the backbone of Leksell radiosurgery. It produces images with excellent soft tissue details highlighting the target and surrounding ""at-risk"" structures conspicuously. However, one must be aware of the MRI distortions that may arise during treatment. Computed tomography (CT) has quick acquisition times giving excellent bony information but inferior soft tissue details. To avail benefits of both these modalities and overcome their individual fallacies and shortcomings, they are often co-registered/fused for stereotactic guidance. Vascular lesions like an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) are best planned with cerebral digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in conjunction with MRI. In specific cases, specialized imaging methods like magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy, positron emission tomography (PET), magneto-encephalography (MEG), etc., may be added to the treatment planning for stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).",2023 Mar-Apr,2023,Neurology India,71,Supplement,S198-S206,eng,False,10.4103/0028-3886.373642;ni_2023_71_7_198_373642;10.4103/0028-3886.373642,Journal Article,"Humans;*Radiosurgery/methods;Radiography;Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods;*Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery;Tomography, X-Ray Computed;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/surgery/pathology",Computed tomography;gamma knife;imaging;magnetic resonance;radiology;radiosurgery;stereotactic
38537789,Long-Term Outcomes After Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Pediatric Brain Arteriovenous Malformations: A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND: The long-term outcomes after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for pediatric brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) remain poorly understood given the paucity of longitudinal studies. A systematic review was conducted to pool cumulative incidences for all outcomes. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were queried to systematically extract potential references. The articles relating to AVMs treated via SRS were required to be written in English, involve pediatric patients (<18 years of age), and include a mean follow-up period of >5 years. Individual patient data were obtained to construct a pooled Kaplan-Meier plot on obliteration rates over time. RESULTS: Among the 6 studies involving 1315 pediatric patients averaging a follow-up period of 86.6 months (range, 6-276), AVM obliteration was observed in 66.1% with cumulative probabilities of 48.28% (95% confidence interval [CI], 41.89-54.68), 76.11% (95% CI, 67.50-84.72), 77.48% (95% CI, 66.37-88.59) over 3, 5, and 10 years, respectively. The cumulative incidence of post-SRS hemorrhage, tumors, cysts, and de novo seizures was 7.2%, 0.3%, 1.6%, and 1.5%, respectively. The cumulative incidence of radiation-induced necrosis, edema, radiologic radiation-induced changes (RICs), symptomatic RICs, and permanent RICs were 8.0%, 1.4%, 28.0%, 8.7%, and 4.9%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Studies assessing long-term outcomes after SRS are moderate in quality and retrospective. Thus, interpretation with caution is advised given the variable degree of loss to follow-up, which suggests that complication rates may be higher than the values stated in the literature.

28552160,Radiosurgery for the management of cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are rare, unstable vascular lesions which spontaneously rupture at a rate of approximately 2-4% annually. Stereotactic radiosurgery is a minimally invasive treatment for AVMs, with a favorable risk-to-benefit profile in most patients, with respect to obliteration, hemorrhage, and seizure control. Radiosurgery is ideally suited for small to medium-sized AVMs (diameter <3cm or volume <12cm(3)) located in deep or eloquent brain regions. Obliteration is ultimately achieved in 70-80% of cases and is directly associated with nidus volume and radiosurgical margin dose. Adverse radiation effects, which appear as T2-weighted hyperintensities on magnetic resonance imaging, develop in 30-40% of patients after AVM radiosurgery, are symptomatic in 10%, and fail to clinically resolve in 2-3%. The risk of AVM hemorrhage may be reduced by radiosurgery, but the hemorrhage risk persists during the latency period between treatment and obliteration. Delayed postradiosurgery cyst formation occurs in 2% of cases and may require surgical treatment. Radiosurgery abolishes or ameliorates seizure activity in the majority of patients with AVM-associated epilepsy and induces de novo seizures in 1-2% of those without preoperative seizures. Strategies for the treatment of large-volume AVMs include neoadjuvant embolization and either dose- or volume-staged radiosurgery.",2017,2017,Handbook of clinical neurology,143,,69-83,eng,False,B978-0-444-63640-9.00007-2;10.1016/B978-0-444-63640-9.00007-2;B978-0-444-63640-9.00007-2;10.1016/B978-0-444-63640-9.00007-2,Journal Article;Review,Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*radiotherapy;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects/methods;Seizures/radiotherapy;Treatment Outcome,embolization;gamma knife;intracranial arteriovenous malformation;intracranial hemorrhage;microsurgery;obliteration;radiosurgery;seizure;stroke;vascular malformation
28117260,Linear accelerator radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations: Updated literature review.,Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are the leading causing of intra-cerebral haemorrhage. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is an established treatment for arteriovenous malformations (AVM) and commonly delivered using Gamma Knife within dedicated radiosurgery units. Linear accelerator (LINAC) SRS is increasingly available however debate remains over whether it offers an equivalent outcome. The aim of this project is to evaluate the outcomes using LINAC SRS for AVMs used within a UK neurosciences unit and review the literature to aid decision making across various SRS platforms. Results have shown comparability across platforms and strongly supports that an adapted LINAC based SRS facility within a dynamic regional neuro-oncology department delivers similar outcomes (in terms of obliteration and toxicity) to any other dedicated radio-surgical platform.

31096248,Gamma Knife Radiosurgery of Arteriovenous Malformations: Long-Term Outcomes and Late Effects.,"Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM) is an accepted treatment option that has been performed for more than 40 years. The goal of AVM GKRS is nidus obliteration to eliminate the risk of intracranial hemorrhage while minimizing the risk of short- and long-term adverse radiation effects (ARE). Nidus obliteration typically occurs between 1 and 5 years after GKRS. The most important factor associated with nidus obliteration is the prescribed radiation dose. The chance of obliteration ranges from 60 to 70% for margin doses of 15-16 Gy to 90% or more for margin doses of 20-25 Gy. Neurologic decline after GKRS can occur from either hemorrhage or ARE. Numerous studies have shown that the risk of AVM bleeding is either unchanged or decreased following GKRS. Advances in neuroimaging and dose-planning software have reduced the incidence of early ARE to <4%. Volume-staged procedures can be safely performed for large-volume AVM that were previously considered too large for GKRS. Late ARE (generally cyst formation) are common in patients who develop early MRI imaging changes (areas of high T2 signal) after GKRS, but most cases can be managed with either observation or resection of the thrombosed AVM.",2019,2019,Progress in neurological surgery,34,,238-247,eng,False,10.1159/000493070;000493070;10.1159/000493070,Journal Article;Review,"Arteriovenous Fistula/*radiotherapy/surgery;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*radiotherapy/surgery;*Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects/*standards",

METHODS: Under the auspices of the International Radiosurgery Research Foundation, this retrospective multicenter study analyzed pediatric patients who underwent repeat, single-session SRS between 1987 and 2022. The primary outcome variable was a favorable outcome, defined as nidus obliteration without hemorrhage or neurological deterioration. Secondary outcomes included rates and probabilities of hemorrhage, radiation-induced changes (RICs), and cyst or tumor formation. RESULTS: The cohort included 83 pediatric patients. The median patient age was 11 years at initial SRS and 15 years at repeat SRS. Fifty-seven children (68.7%) were managed exclusively using SRS, and 42 (50.6%) experienced hemorrhage prior to SRS. Median AVM diameter and volume were substantially different between the first (25 mm and 4.5 cm3, respectively) and second (16.5 mm and 1.6 cm3, respectively) SRS, while prescription dose and isodose line remained similar. At the 5-year follow-up evaluation from the second SRS, nidus obliteration was achieved in 42 patients (50.6%), with favorable outcome in 37 (44.6%). The median time to nidus obliteration and hemorrhage was 35.5 and 38.5 months, respectively. The yearly cumulative probability of favorable outcome increased from 2.5% (95% CI 0.5%-7.8%) at 1 year to 44% (95% CI 32%-55%) at 5 years. The probability of achieving obliteration followed a similar pattern and reached 51% (95% CI 38%-62%) at 5 years. The 5-year risk of hemorrhage during the latency period after the second SRS reached 8% (95% CI 3.2%-16%). Radiographically, 25 children (30.1%) had RICs, but only 5 (6%) were symptomatic. Delayed cyst formation occurred in 7.2% of patients, with a median onset of 47 months. No radiation-induced neoplasia was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The study results showed nidus obliteration in most pediatric patients who underwent repeat SRS for persistent AVMs. The risks of symptomatic RICs and latency period hemorrhage were quite low. These findings suggest that repeat radiosurgery should be considered when treating pediatric patients with residual AVM after prior SRS. Further study is needed to define the role of repeat SRS more fully in this population.",2024 Apr 1,2024,Journal of neurosurgery.

The reported overall annual hemorrhage rate is 3.0%, for unruptured AVMs it is 2.2%, and for ruptured AVMs, 4.5%. The main goal of AVM treatment is to prevent intracerebral hemorrhage. This is achieved by complete nidus eradication. Interventional treatment options include microsurgery, embolization and radiosurgery, as well as multimodal approaches. Radiosurgery is a safe and effective alternative to surgery or embolization, especially for AVMs located in deep or eloquent brain regions, where invasive treatment cannot be performed. With the introduction of the Leksell Gamma Knife, AVMs became one of the most common indications for radiosurgical interventions (nearly 30% of the first 15-year experience).

30149173,Endovascular Therapy for Brainstem Arteriovenous Malformations.,"Brainstem arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) represent ∼5% of all intracranial AVMs and carry a higher risk of hemorrhage than their supratentorial counterparts. There is a high and near-uniform mortality with initial and recurrent episodes of hemorrhage. Brainstem AVMs may also present symptomatically with focal neurologic deficits or hydrocephalus. Treatment is indicated for ruptured and symptomatic brainstem AVMs, as well as those possessing high-risk angioarchitectural features. Microsurgical resection and stereotactic radiosurgery are ideal therapeutic options when feasible. Embolization is most commonly used as adjunctive treatment before surgery or stereotactic radiosurgical irradiation. Preoperative embolization facilitates microsurgical resection and reduces intraoperative and postoperative hemorrhage rates. Use of embolization preradiosurgically helps to reduce nidal size, transforming a large lesion to a size amenable to radiosurgical intervention, increasing the probability of obliteration, decreasing procedural hemorrhage risk, stabilizing the lesion until radiotherapeutic effect achieves obliteration, and providing interval symptomatic resolution. Embolization may also be used effectively as stand-alone monotherapy for small lesions with 1 or 2 arterial feeders not supplying eloquent parenchyma. Although an extensive evidence base exists for clinical usefulness of stereotactic radiosurgery as monotherapy or in combination with other therapeutic modalities, only a few studies have reported specifically on obliteration and complication rates with monotherapeutic embolization in the treatment of brainstem AVMs. The potential role of embolization as monotherapy for brainstem AVMs is reviewed and discussed.",2019 May,2019,World neurosurgery,125,,481-488,eng,False,S1878-8750(18)31882-5;10.1016/j.wneu.2018.08.099;S1878-8750(18)31882-5;10.1016/j.wneu.2018.08.099,Journal Article;Review,"Brain Stem/*blood supply;Combined Modality Therapy;Embolization, Therapeutic/*methods;Endovascular Procedures/*methods;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/pathology/*therapy;Microsurgery/methods;Radiosurgery/methods;Treatment Outcome",AVM;Brainstem;Curative;Embolization;Endovascular;Multimodal;Treatment

They are usually used as ancillary techniques to microsurgery but may also be used as solitary treatment options. Careful patient selection requires a clear estimate of the treatment efficacy and complication rates for the individual patient. As such, classification schemes are an essential part of patient selection paradigm for each treatment modality. While the Spetzler-Martin grading system and its subsequent modifications are commonly used for microsurgical outcome prediction for bAVMs, the same system(s) may not be easily applicable to SRS and endovascular therapy. Several radiosurgical- and endovascular-based grading scales have been proposed for bAVMs. However, a comprehensive review of these systems including a discussion on their relative advantages and disadvantages is missing.

However, reporting studies are limited by small patient numbers and single-institution biases. The purpose of this study was to provide the combined experience of multiple centers, in an effort to fully define the role of repeat SRS for patients with arteriovenous malformation. METHODS: This multicenter, retrospective cohort study included patients treated with repeat, single-fraction SRS between 1987 and 2022. Follow-up began at repeat SRS. The primary outcome was a favorable patient outcome, defined as a composite of nidus obliteration in the absence of hemorrhage or radiation-induced neurological deterioration. Secondary outcomes were obliteration, hemorrhage risk, and symptomatic radiation-induced changes. Competing risk analysis was performed to compute yearly rates and identify predictors for each outcome. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 505 patients (254 [50.3%] males; median [interquartile range] age, 34 [15] years) from 14 centers. The median clinical and magnetic resonance imaging follow-up was 52 (interquartile range, 61) and 47 (interquartile range, 52) months, respectively. At last follow-up, favorable outcome was achieved by 268 (53.1%) patients (5-year probability, 50% [95% CI, 45%-55%]) and obliteration by 300 (59.4%) patients (5-year probability, 56% [95% CI, 51%-61%]). Twenty-eight patients (5.6%) experienced post-SRS hemorrhage with an annual incidence rate of 1.38 per 100 patient-years. Symptomatic radiation-induced changes were evident in 28 (5.6%) patients, with most occurring in the first 3 years. Larger nidus volumes (between 2 and 4 cm(3), subdistribution hazard, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.44-0.86]; P=0.005; >4 cm(3), subdistribution hazard, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.32-0.7]; P<0.001) and brainstem/basal ganglia involvement (subdistribution hazard, 0.6 [95% CI, 0.45-0.81]; P<0.001) were associated with reduced probability of favorable outcome.

38134430,"Effect of cerebral arteriovenous malformation location on outcomes of repeat, single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery: a matched-cohort analysis.","OBJECTIVE: Patients with deep-seated arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) have a higher rate of unfavorable outcome and lower rate of nidus obliteration after primary stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). The aim of this study was to evaluate and quantify the effect of AVM location on repeat SRS outcomes. METHODS: This retrospective, multicenter study involved 505 AVM patients managed with repeat, single-session SRS. The endpoints were nidus obliteration, hemorrhage in the latency period, radiation-induced changes (RICs), and favorable outcome. Patients were split on the basis of AVM location into the deep (brainstem, basal ganglia, thalamus, deep cerebellum, and corpus callosum) and superficial cohorts. The cohorts were matched 1:1 on the basis of the covariate balancing score for volume, eloquence of location, and prescription dose. RESULTS: After matching, 149 patients remained in each cohort. The 5-year cumulative probability rates for favorable outcome (probability difference -18%, 95% CI -30.9 to -5.8%, p = 0.004) and AVM obliteration (probability difference -18%, 95% CI -30.1% to -6.4%, p = 0.007) were significantly lower in the deep AVM cohort. No significant differences were observed in the 5-year cumulative probability rates for hemorrhage (probability difference 3%, 95% CI -2.4% to 8.5%, p = 0.28) or RICs (probability difference 1%, 95% CI -10.6% to 11.7%, p = 0.92). The median time to delayed cyst formation was longer with deep-seated AVMs (deep 62 months vs superficial 12 months, p = 0.047).

35255633,A Rational Approach to the Management of Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformations.,"OBJECTIVE: Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) typify the delicate balance cerebrovascular specialists face in weighing the treatment risk against the natural history of a pathologic lesion. The goal of our review was to provide an overview of the current evidence for the treatment of cerebral AVMs and describe a contemporary approach to developing a treatment strategy according to individual AVM characteristics. METHODS: A review of the contemporary literature on the natural history and treatment of cerebral AVMs was completed through the PubMed and Google Scholar databases. The studies were reviewed for original advances in the characterization and treatment of cerebral AVMs. RESULTS: The overall risk of hemorrhage for cerebral AVMs is 2%-4% per year. Individual AVM characteristics, including small size, exclusive deep venous drainage, deep or posterior fossa location, venous ectasia, and the presence of a flow-associated aneurysm, appear to confer a greater risk of presentation with rupture. A diverse array of modalities have been developed to achieve the goal of complete lesion obliteration, including microsurgery, endovascular therapy, and radiosurgery.

35901714,Repeat stereotactic radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this retrospective, single-institution study was to evaluate radiological and clinical outcomes of patients managed with repeat stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for residual cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) after prior SRS. METHODS: The authors evaluated the clinical and radiological outcomes of consecutive patients treated with repeat single-session SRS for a residual brain AVM from 1989 to 2021. RESULTS: In total, 170 patients underwent repeat SRS for AVM (90 [52.9%] females; median [interquartile range] age at the first SRS procedure 28 [21.5] years; median [interquartile range] age at the second SRS procedure 32 [22.5] years). After repeat SRS, the actuarial 3-, 5-, and 10-year AVM obliteration rates were 37.6%, 57.3%, and 80.9%, respectively. Higher obliteration rates were associated with margin dose ≥ 19 Gy (p = 0.001). After the second SRS procedure, hemorrhage occurred in 8.2% of patients and was lethal in 1 patient. The risk factors of intracranial hemorrhage were age < 18 years (p = 0.03) and residual AVM diameter > 20 mm (p = 0.004). Lower obliteration rates were noted in patients with residual AVM diameter > 20 mm (p = 0.04) and those < 18 years of age (p = 0.04). Asymptomatic, symptomatic, and permanent radiation-induced changes (RICs) after the second SRS procedure occurred in 25.9%, 8.8%, and 5.3% of patients, respectively, and were associated with RIC after the first SRS procedure (p = 0.006). There was 1 case of a radiation-induced meningioma 12 years after SRS. CONCLUSIONS: Repeat SRS is a reasonable therapeutic option, in particular for patients with residual AVM. Repeat SRS was associated with more favorable outcomes in adult patients and those with residual AVM smaller than 20 mm in maximum diameter. To increase the rate of residual AVM obliteration, a prescription dose ≥ 19 Gy should ideally be used for repeat SRS.",2022 Jul,2022,Neurosurgical focus,53,1,E11,eng,True,10.3171/2022.4.FOCUS2294;10.3171/2022.4.FOCUS2294,Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/radiotherapy/surgery;Male;*Radiosurgery/methods;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome,Gamma Knife;arteriovenous malformations;cerebral;repeat stereotactic radiosurgery
26740034,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for deep intracranial arteriovenous malformations, part 1: Brainstem arteriovenous malformations.","The management of brainstem arteriovenous malformations (AVM) are one of the greatest challenges encountered by neurosurgeons. Brainstem AVM have a higher risk of hemorrhage compared to AVM in other locations, and rupture of these lesions commonly results in devastating neurological morbidity and mortality. The potential morbidity associated with currently available treatment modalities further compounds the complexity of decision making for affected patients. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has an important role in the management of brainstem AVM. SRS offers acceptable obliteration rates with lower risks of hemorrhage occurring during the latency period. Complex nidal architecture requires a multi-disciplinary treatment approach. Nidi partly involving subpial/epipial regions of the dorsal midbrain or cerebellopontine angle should be considered for a combination of endovascular embolization, micro-surgical resection and SRS. Considering the fact that incompletely obliterated lesions (even when reduced in size) could still cause lethal hemorrhages, additional treatment, including repeat SRS and surgical resection should be considered when complete obliteration is not achieved by first SRS.

36175931,Linac-based stereotactic radiosurgery for brain arteriovenous malformations.,"PURPOSE: Linac stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is gaining popularity as a form of radiation treatment for cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) since the theory of combined radiosurgical and endovascular treatment poses much uncertainty and due to significant technical progress for SRS. This study focuses on how to evaluate obliteration and re-bleeding rates, and to determine factors and adverse effects influencing obliteration after linac-based SRS for cerebral AVMs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From a statistical record of 71 patients, 31 had partial embolisation, five surgery and 29 had no prior treatment. Using Kaplan-Meier survival and life table analyses, actuarial obliteration and annual bleeding hazard rates were calculated after SRS. RESULTS: After a follow up of 1, 2 and 3 years the actual obliteration rates were 22, 59 and 66%, respectively whereby it was noted that prior embolization had no effect on the obliteration rate. Annual bleeding hazard rates were further analyzed after stereotactic radiosurgery to be 2.1% and 1.4% for the first and second year respectively. Asymptomatic abnormalities were detected after imaging in 33.9% of patients. A dose of less than 18 Gy significantly reduced the obliteration probability. CONCLUSION: SRS is a therapeutic option for intracerebral AVM. In general, there is a low rate of morbidity and a high probability of nidus obliteration.",2022 Sep 29,2022,"Radiation oncology (London, England)",17,1,161,eng,True,10.1186/s13014-022-02130-2;161;10.1186/s13014-022-02130-2;2130;10.1186/s13014-022-02130-2,Journal Article,Brain;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/radiotherapy/surgery;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects/methods;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome,AVM;Obliteration;Radiosurgery;SRS;Stereotactic radiotherapy

Embolization, radiosurgery, advanced imaging modalities, neuropsychological testing and advances in surgical technique has both significantly improved our ability to treat patients, as well as confounding the landscape as to what constitutes best medical practice. Variability in natural history provides additional challenges in that it is challenging to determine an accurate estimate of the risk of hemorrhage, morbidity and mortality.

34330101,Chronic encapsulated expanding hematomas after stereotactic radiosurgery for intracranial arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVE: Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are rare cerebral vascular lesions that are associated with high morbidity and mortality from hemorrhage; however, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a well-validated treatment modality. Few reports have delineated a subgroup of patients who develop delayed chronic encapsulated expanding hematomas (CEEHs) despite angiographic evidence of AVM obliteration following radiosurgery. In this report, the authors performed a retrospective review of more than 1000 radiosurgically treated intracranial AVM cases to delineate the incidence and management of this rare entity. METHODS: Between 1988 and 2019, 1010 patients with intracranial AVM underwent Gamma Knife SRS at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. In addition to a review of a prospective institutional database, the authors performed a retrospective chart review of the departmental AVM database to specifically identify patients with CEEH. Pertinent clinical and radiological characteristics as well as patient outcomes were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: Nine hundred fifty patients with intracranial AVM (94%) had sufficient clinical follow-up for analysis. Of these, 6 patients with CEEH underwent delayed resection (incidence rate of 0.0045 event per person-year). These patients included 4 males and 2 females with a mean age of 45.3 ± 13.8 years at the time of initial SRS. Four patients had smaller AVM volumes (4.9-10 cm3), and 3 of them were treated with a single SRS procedure. Two patients had larger-volume AVMs (55 and 56 cm3), and both underwent multimodal management that included staged SRS and embolization. Time to initial recognition of the CEEH after initial SRS ranged between 66 and 243 months. The time between CEEH recognition and resection ranged from 2 to 9 months. Resection was required because of progressive neurological symptoms that correlated with imaging evidence of gradual hematoma expansion. All 6 patients had angiographically confirmed obliteration of their AVM. Pathology revealed a mixed chronicity hematoma with areas of fibrosed blood vessels and rare areas of neovascularization with immature blood vessels but no evidence of a persistent AVM. All 6 patients reported persistent clinical improvement after hematoma resection. CONCLUSIONS: CEEH after SRS for AVM is a rare complication with an incidence rate of 0.0045 event per person-year over the authors' 30-year experience. When clinical symptoms progress and imaging reveals progressive enlargement over time, complete resection of a CEEH results in significant clinical recovery.

39350126,Stereotactic radiosurgery alone for brain arteriovenous malformations: a single-institute experience.,"OBJECTIVE: Brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVMs) represent an ongoing clinical challenge because of their complex nature. The long-term outcomes of BAVMs patients treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) alone are unclear. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 201 patients treated for BAVMs from January 2010 to December 2019. The identified predictors of obliteration or hemorrhage in the multivariate analysis were estimated by odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: A total of 201 patients treated with gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) alone as the primary treatment for BAVMs were included. The mean age at GKRS treatment was 31.4 ± 1.1 years, and 61.2% of the patients were male. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that a higher radiosurgery-based AVM score (OR 1.847, 95% CI = 1.292-2.641; p = 0.001) was significantly associated with worse obliteration, and a higher margin dose significantly favored obliteration (OR 0.352, 95% CI = 0.189-0.658; p = 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that an increased lesion volume of 1 cm(3) (OR 1.279, 95% CI = 1.023-1.600; p = 0.031) and a high margin dose (OR 0.363, 95% CI = 0.134-0.983; p = 0.046) were significant prognostic factors for post-SRS hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our study investigated the available clinical and radiological prognostic factors for BAVMs and revealed that a higher margin dose significantly improved both the obliteration rate and nonhemorrhagic outcomes.

37132535,Endovascular treatment of brain arteriovenous malformations: clinical outcomes of patients included in the registry of a pragmatic randomized trial.,"OBJECTIVE: The role of endovascular treatment in the management of patients with brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) remains uncertain. AVM embolization can be offered as stand-alone curative therapy or prior to surgery or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) (pre-embolization). The Treatment of Brain AVMs Study (TOBAS) is an all-inclusive pragmatic study that comprises two randomized trials and multiple registries. METHODS: Results from the TOBAS curative and pre-embolization registries are reported. The primary outcome for this report is death or dependency (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score > 2) at last follow-up. Secondary outcomes include angiographic results, perioperative serious adverse events (SAEs), and permanent treatment-related complications leading to an mRS score > 2. RESULTS: From June 2014 to May 2021, 1010 patients were recruited in TOBAS. Embolization was chosen as the primary curative treatment for 116 patients and pre-embolization prior to surgery or SRS for 92 patients. Clinical and angiographic outcomes were available in 106 (91%) of 116 and 77 (84%) of 92 patients, respectively. In the curative embolization registry, 70% of AVMs were ruptured, and 62% were low-grade AVMs (Spetzler-Martin grade I or II), while the pre-embolization registry had 70% ruptured AVMs and 58% low-grade AVMs. The primary outcome of death or disability (mRS score > 2) occurred in 15 (14%, 95% CI 8%-22%) of the 106 patients in the curative embolization registry (4 [12%, 95% CI 5%-28%] of 32 unruptured AVMs and 11 [15%, 95% CI 8%-25%] of 74 ruptured AVMs) and 9 (12%, 95% CI 6%-21%) of the 77 patients in the pre-embolization registry (4 [17%, 95% CI 7%-37%] of 23 unruptured AVMs and 5 [9%, 95% CI 4%-20%] of 54 ruptured AVMs) at 2 years. Embolization alone was confirmed to occlude the AVM in 32 (30%, 95% CI 21%-40%) of the 106 curative attempts and in 9 (12%, 95% CI 6%-21%) of 77 patients in the pre-embolization registry. SAEs occurred in 28 of the 106 attempted curative patients (26%, 95% CI 18%-35%, including 21 new symptomatic hemorrhages [20%, 95% CI 13%-29%]). Five of the new hemorrhages were in previously unruptured AVMs (n = 32; 16%, 95% CI 5%-33%). Of the 77 pre-embolization patients, 18 had SAEs (23%, 95% CI 15%-34%), including 12 new symptomatic hemorrhages [16%, 95% CI 9%-26%]). Three of the hemorrhages were in previously unruptured AVMs (3/23; 13%, 95% CI 3%-34%). CONCLUSIONS: Embolization as a curative treatment for brain AVMs was often incomplete. Hemorrhagic complications were frequent, even when the specified intent was pre-embolization before surgery or SRS. Because the role of endovascular treatment remains uncertain, it should preferably, when possible, be offered in the context of a randomized trial.",2023 May 1,2023,Journal of neurosurgery,138,5,1393-1402,eng,False,10.3171/2022.9.JNS22987;10.3171/2022.9.JNS22987,Journal Article;Randomized Controlled Trial,"Humans;Treatment Outcome;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/therapy/etiology;*Embolization, Therapeutic/adverse effects/methods;Registries;*Radiosurgery/methods;Brain;Retrospective Studies",brain arteriovenous malformation;care trial;endovascular neurosurgery;endovascular treatment registry;randomized trial;ruptured AVM;unruptured AVM;vascular disorders
29961383,"Transvenous embolization of brain arteriovenous malformations: a review of techniques, indications, and outcomes.","Endovascular embolization of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is conventionally performed from a transarterial approach. Transarterial AVM embolization can be a standalone treatment or, more commonly, used as a neoadjuvant therapy prior to microsurgery or stereotactic radiosurgery. In contrast to the transarterial approach, curative embolization of AVMs may be more readily achieved from a transvenous approach. Transvenous embolization is considered a salvage therapy in contemporary AVM management. Proposed indications for this approach include a small (diameter < 3 cm) and compact AVM nidus, deep AVM location, hemorrhagic presentation, single draining vein, lack of an accessible arterial pedicle, exclusive arterial supply by perforators, and en passage feeding arteries. Available studies of transvenous AVM embolization in the literature have reported high complete obliteration rates, with reasonably low complication rates. However, evaluating the efficacy and safety of this approach is challenging due to the limited number of published cases.

28344181,Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Pediatric High-Grade Brain Arteriovenous Malformations: Our Experience and Review of Literature.,"INTRODUCTION: Although high-grade AVMs pose a particularly high lifetime hemorrhage risk to pediatric patients (age <18 years), little is known about the treatment outcomes. Therefore, the aim of this retrospective cohort study was to evaluate the outcomes after single-session stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for pediatric high-grade AVMs. METHODS: We reviewed baseline and treatment outcomes data from pediatric patients aged less than 18 years with Spetzler-Martin grade IV AVMs treated with SRS in a single session at our institution. The study cohort comprised 28 pediatric patients with Spetzler-Martin grade IV AVMs, with a mean age of 12.1 years. Statistical analyses were performed to determine predictors of obliteration and compare the outcomes of patients with versus without previous AVM hemorrhage. RESULTS: The mean nidus volume, radiosurgical margin dose, and follow-up duration were 5.9 cm(3), 19.4 Gy, and 116 months, respectively. The actuarial obliteration rates at 3, 5, 7, and 10 years were 11%, 19%, 29%, and 35%, respectively. Older age was significantly associated with obliteration in the univariate Cox proportional regression analysis (P = 0.01). During the latency period before obliteration, the annual post-SRS hemorrhage rate was 3.2%. Symptomatic and permanent radiation-induced changes were detected in 7.1% and 3.5%, respectively. A favorable outcome was achieved in 35.7%, and it was more frequently achieved for those with ruptured AVMs (P = 0.0484). CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of single-session SRS for the treatment of high-grade AVMs in the pediatric population is limited, particularly for those with unruptured nidi. Multimodal therapies should be considered in the management of selected pediatric high-grade AVMs. However, further prospective analyses are warranted to define the optimal management strategy for these challenging vascular malformations.",2017 Jun,2017,World neurosurgery,102,,613-622,eng,False,S1878-8750(17)30387-X;10.1016/j.wneu.2017.03.064;S1878-8750(17)30387-X;10.1016/j.wneu.2017.03.064,Journal Article;Review,"Adolescent;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Humans;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*radiotherapy;Male;Radiosurgery/*methods;Recurrence;Reoperation;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome",Gamma Knife;Intracranial arteriovenous malformation;Intracranial hemorrhages;Pediatric;Radiosurgery;Spetzler-Martin grade IV and V;Stroke;Vascular malformations
37061031,Gamma Knife Radiosurgery for Spetzler-Martin Grade III Brain Arteriovenous Malformations.,"BACKGROUND: Spetzler-Martin (SM) grade III arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) show angioarchitecture heterogeneity and lack a clearly defined treatment strategy. This study aims to evaluate outcomes after treatment of SM grade III AVMs with Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS). METHODS: A single-institution retrospective analysis was conducted of 307 patients with SM grade III AVMs undergoing GKRS between October 2006 and December 2020 with follow-up times of at least 24 months. SM grade III AVMs were classified into 4 subtypes: IIIA (S1E1V1), IIIB (S2E0V1), subtype IIIC (S2E1V0), and IIID (S3E0V0). RESULTS: Over a median follow-up time of 50.3 months, complete AVM obliteration was achieved in 211 patients (68.7%). Complete obliteration rates in subtypes IIIA, IIIB, IIIC, and IIID were 80.8%, 55.4%, 53.4%, and 25.0%, respectively. Annual post-GKRS hemorrhage risk was 0.8%. Significant radiosurgery-induced imaging changes occurred in 7 patients (2.3%). Three variables were identified as predictors of obliteration in final forward stepwise regression models, including volume of AVM (B = -0.011; P < 0.001), age (B = -0.004; P = 0.024), and previous AVM hemorrhage (B = 0.187; P = 0.077).

This article is a review of recent studies assessing the efficacy of pre-radiosurgical embolization for brain AVMs. Articles published between 1990 and 2017 on the subject of pre-radiosurgical AVM embolization were retrieved from PubMed. A literature review was performed on the selected studies to compare obliteration, hemorrhage, and complication rates from groups treated with embolization prior to radiosurgery to those treated without embolization.

25175436,Seizure outcomes following radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECT: Seizures are a common presentation of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). The authors evaluated the efficacy of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for the management of seizures associated with AVMs and identified factors influencing seizure outcomes following SRS for AVMs. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed using PubMed. Studies selected for review were published in English, included at least 5 patients with both cerebral AVMs and presenting seizures treated with SRS, and provided post-SRS outcome data regarding obliteration of AVMs and/or seizures. Demographic, radiosurgical, radiological, and seizure outcome data were extracted and analyzed. All seizure outcomes were categorized as follows: 1) seizure free, 2) seizure improvement, 3) seizure unchanged, and 4) seizure worsened. Systematic statistical analysis was conducted to assess the effect of post-SRS AVM obliteration on seizure outcome. RESULTS: Nineteen case series with a total of 3971 AVM patients were included for analysis. Of these, 28% of patients presented with seizures, and data for 997 patients with available seizure outcome data who met the inclusion criteria were evaluated. Of these, 437 (43.8%) patients achieved seizure-free status after SRS, and 530 (68.7%) of 771 patients with available data achieved seizure control (seizure freedom or seizure improvement) following SRS. Factors associated with improved seizure outcomes following SRS for AVMs were analyzed in 9 studies. Seizure-free status was achieved in 82% and 41.0% of patients with complete and incomplete AVM obliteration, respectively. Complete AVM obliteration offered superior seizure-free rates compared with incomplete AVM obliteration (OR 6.13; 95% CI 2.16-17.44; p = 0.0007).

38369533,Vascular compactness of unruptured brain arteriovenous malformation predicts risk of hemorrhage after stereotactic radiosurgery.,"The aim of the study was to investigate whether morphology (i.e. compact/diffuse) of brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) correlates with the incidence of hemorrhagic events in patients receiving Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) for unruptured bAVMs. This retrospective study included 262 adult patients with unruptured bAVMs who underwent upfront SRS. Hemorrhagic events were defined as evidence of blood on CT or MRI. The morphology of bAVMs was evaluated using automated segmentation which calculated the proportion of vessel, brain tissue, and cerebrospinal fluid in bAVMs on T2-weighted MRI. Compactness index, defined as the ratio of vessel to brain tissue, categorized bAVMs into compact and diffuse types based on the optimal cutoff. Cox proportional hazard model was used to identify the independent factors for post-SRS hemorrhage. The median clinical follow-ups was 62.1 months. Post-SRS hemorrhage occurred in 13 (5.0%) patients and one of them had two bleeds, resulting in an annual bleeding rate of 0.8%. Multivariable analysis revealed bAVM morphology (compact versus diffuse), bAVM volume, and prescribed margin dose were significant predictors. The post-SRS hemorrhage rate increased with larger bAVM volume only among the diffuse nidi (1.7 versus 14.9 versus 30.6 hemorrhage per 1000 person-years in bAVM volume < 20 cm(3) versus 20-40 cm(3) versus > 40 cm(3); p = 0.022). The significantly higher post-SRS hemorrhage rate of Spetzler-Martin grade IV-V compared with grade I-III bAVMs (20.0 versus 3.3 hemorrhages per 1000 person-years; p = 0.001) mainly originated from the diffuse bAVMs rather than the compact subgroup (30.9 versus 4.8 hemorrhages per 1000 person-years; p = 0.035). Compact and smaller bAVMs, with higher prescribed margin dose harbor lower risks of post-SRS hemorrhage. The post-SRS hemorrhage rate exceeded 2.2% annually within the diffuse and large (> 40 cm(3)) bAVMs and the diffuse Spetzler-Martin IV-V bAVMs. These findings may help guide patient selection of SRS for the unruptured bAVMs.",2024 Feb 18,2024,Scientific reports,14,1,4011,eng,False,10.1038/s41598-024-54369-2;4011;10.1038/s41598-024-54369-2;54369;10.1038/s41598-024-54369-2,Journal Article,Adult;Humans;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects/methods;Brain;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic;Hemorrhage/epidemiology/etiology;Follow-Up Studies,Arteriovenous malformation morphology;Automated segmentation;Compactness index;Post-SRS hemorrhage;Stereotactic radiosurgery;Vascular disorders
22107864,Stereotactic radiosurgery of cranial arteriovenous malformations and dural arteriovenous fistulas.,"Cranial arteriovenous malformations (AVM) and cranial dural arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) carry a significant risk of morbidity and mortality when they hemorrhage. Current treatment options include surgery, embolization, radiosurgery, or a combination of these treatments. Radiosurgery is thought to reduce the risk hemorrhage in AVMs and AVFs by obliterating of the nidus of abnormal vasculature over the course of 2 to 3 years. Success in treating AVMs is variable depending on the volume of the lesion, the radiation dose, and the pattern of vascular supply and drainage.

23258517,Stereotactic radiosurgery guideline for the management of patients with intracranial arteriovenous malformations.,Our objective was to provide guidelines about the use of stereotactic radiosurgery in symptomatic patients with imaging-identified arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the brain. We reviewed evidence-based medicine and clinical experience with radiosurgery for AVM of the brain to develop guidelines and provide scientific foundation for patients and physicians. Major recommendations include the definition of AVM patients suitable for various management strategies ranging from observation to surgical excision to endovascular embolization and stereotactic radiosurgery. The optimal dose range for volumetric conformal AVM stereotactic radiosurgery has been largely established based on location and volume of the AVM. The relationship to prior embolization or prior surgery has been evaluated. The role of repeat radiosurgery has been assessed for those patients with incomplete obliteration of their AVM after 3 years have elapsed. The causes of failure of stereotactic radiosurgery have also been identified. A clinical algorithm for the potential role of stereotactic radiosurgery for a symptomatic brain AVM was defined. The guidelines provide a framework for professional judgment and treatment selection alternatives.,2013,2013,Progress in neurological surgery,27,,130-40,eng,False,10.1159/000341773;000341773;10.1159/000341773,Journal Article;Review,Arteriovenous Fistula/diagnosis/*surgery;Disease Management;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/*surgery;Patient Selection;Practice Guidelines as Topic/*standards;Radiosurgery/methods/*standards,
37026339,Gamma Knife Radiosurgery in Partially Embolised Arteriovenous Malformations: Management Dilemmas and Outcomes.,"INTRODUCTION: The role of Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) in partially embolized arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) has always remained a subject of debate. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of GKRS in partially embolized AVMs and to analyze factor that influence its obliteration. METHODS: This was a retrospective study from a single institute performed over a period of 12 years (2005-2017). It included all patients who underwent GKRS for partially embolized AVMs. Demographic characteristics, treatment profiles, and clinical and radiological data were obtained during treatment and follow-up. Obliteration rates and factors affecting the same were sought and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 46 patients with a mean age of 30 years (range: 9-60 years) were included in the study. Follow-up imaging was available for 35 patients either by digital subtraction angiography (DSA) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We found complete AVM obliteration in 21 patients (60%): one had near total obliteration (>90% obliteration), 12 had subtotal obliteration (<90%), and one had no change in the volume following GKRS. Following embolization alone, an average of 67% of the AVM volume was obliterated which resulted in an average 79% final obliteration rate after Gamma Knife radiosurgery. Mean duration to complete obliteration was found to be 3.45 years (range: 1-10 years). There was a significant difference (P = 0.04) in the mean interval between embolization and GKRS among cases with complete obliteration (12 months) and those with incomplete obliteration (36 months). There was no significant difference (P = 0.49) in the average obliteration rate between the ARUBA-eligible unruptured AVMs (79.22%) and ruptured AVMs (79.04%). Bleeding after GKRS during the latency period had a negative impact on obliteration (P = 0.05). Other factors like age, sex, Spetzler-Martin (SM)-grade, Pollock Flickinger score (PF-score), nidus volume, radiation dose, or presentation before embolization had no significant influence on obliteration. Three patients had permanent neurological deficits after embolization and none after radiosurgery. Six out of nine patients (66%) presenting with seizures were seizure-free after the treatment. Hemorrhage was noted in three patients following combined treatment and were managed non-surgically. CONCLUSION: Obliteration rates in partially embolized AVM after Gamma Knife are inferior when compared to Gamma Knife alone; moreover with volume staging and/or dose staging being increasingly plausible due to the new ICON machine, embolization may be completely replaced. However we have shown that in complicated and carefully chosen AVMs, embolization followed by GKRS is a valid modality of management. This study represents a real-world picture of individualized AVM treatment depending on patient choices and resources available.",2023 Mar-Apr,2023,Neurology India,71,Supplement,S90-S99,eng,False,10.4103/0028-3886.373655;ni_2023_71_7_90_373655;10.4103/0028-3886.373655,Journal Article,Humans;Adult;*Radiosurgery/methods;Treatment Outcome;Follow-Up Studies;Retrospective Studies;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic,AVM;embolization;gamma knife radiosurgery

37999787,Primary endovascular embolisation of intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVM)-UK single centre experience.,"PURPOSE: Intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) treated at our institution with modern techniques of endovascular intervention were analysed for the rate of complete occlusion, associated morbidity, and mortality. To our knowledge, this is the first series from the UK evaluating the effectiveness of endovascular embolisation as a primary treatment for selected cases. METHODS: All newly referred AVMs between January 2017 and June 2022 were reviewed and those treated with primary endovascular intervention were identified. Details of the endovascular procedures were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: In 5½ years, 41.1% of AVMs referred to our institution have been triaged for primary endovascular intervention. Sixty-eight AVMs were embolised and followed-up: 44 ruptured and 24 unruptured. Spetzler-Martin grading varied from I to III, and a single AVM was grade IV. The approach was arterial in 73.5%, solely venous in 7.4%, and combined in 19.1%. The mean follow-up was 18 months for imaging and 26 months for clinical assessment. Complete obliteration was achieved in 95.6%. Ruptured AVM cohort: The rate of functional deterioration was 13.6%. Unruptured AVM cohort: The rate of functional deterioration secondary to complications from embolisation was 4.2%. CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular embolisation may be a favourable option for primary AVM treatment in carefully selected patients.

37543746,Incorporation of Brain Connectomics for Stereotactic Radiosurgery Treatment Planning.,"BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE: Neurosurgeons have integrated neuroanatomy-based tractography to avoid critical structures during dose planning. However, they have yet to integrate more comprehensive connectome networks for radiosurgical planning. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A young man presented with a Spetzler-Martin Grade 3 right temporal arteriovenous malformation. DISCUSSION: As proof of concept, we incorporated connectomic networks including default mode network, optic radiation and central executive network into the Gamma Knife radiosurgical treatment planning workflow. Connectome networks were created from T1 anatomic and diffusion-weighted images magnetic resonance images using Quicktome software. The resulting networks were voxel-encoded in the magnetic resonance images, imported into GammaPlan, and segmented by image thresholding. The GammaPlan Lightning optimizer was used to create radiosurgical plans with a dose of 20 Gy to the 50% isodose line delivered to the arteriovenous malformation nidus both with and without treating these networks as risk structures. When taking into account the connectome networks, a maximum dose restriction of 14 Gy was placed on each network during lightning dose planning. With default mode network, optic radiation, and central executive network as risk structures, the maximum dose and V 12Gy were reduced by 23.4% and 88.3%, 20% and 34.3%, and 29.8% and 63.2%, respectively. CONCLUSION: We were able to incorporate connectomes into radiosurgical dose planning approaches.

Although studies on bleeding risk of cerebral AVMs in pregnancy are very few and there are different results between them, pregnancy will increase the hemorrhagic risk of AVM, and ruptured cerebral AVM in pregnancy should be treated actively. After intracranial hemorrhage, cerebral angiography should be performed for pregnant women shielded correctly. Cerebral angiography could clearly demonstrate the characteristics of cerebral AVM. The results from the literature show that the radiation dose of endovascular and stereotactic radiotherapy for cerebral AVM in pregnancy is below the safety value and is safe.

Treatment modalities include resection, endovascular embolization, and stereotactic radiosurgery. There is currently no consensus favoring one modality over another. Timing of multimodal therapy with embolization/stereotactic radiosurgery and resection is not well explored in the literature. We present a series of pediatric patients with AVMs, with special attention directed to the timing of treatment. METHODS: Electronic medical records of all pediatric patients (<18 years old at treatment) with AVMs treated at our institution were retrospectively reviewed after institutional review board approval. Demographic information, AVM characteristics, treatment variables, and outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: In our cohort of 27 patients, 21 (77.8%) presented with a ruptured AVM. Of these patients, 6 (28.6%) had a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3-10 and underwent treatment within 24 hours of presentation, and 10 (47.6%) with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 12-15 were treated between 24 and 120 hours after presentation. The remaining 5 patients (23.8%) were treated 3 weeks to 14 months after AVM rupture. Regardless of rupture status, 96% of our cohort had a modified Rankin Scale score of 1-2 at most recent follow-up.

37720924,Long-term outcomes of microsurgery and stereotactic radiosurgery as the first-line treatment for arteriovenous malformations: a propensity score-matched analysis using nationwide multicenter prospective registry data.,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to compare the risk and benefit profile of microsurgery (MS) and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) as the first-line treatment for unruptured and ruptured arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors included AVMs underwent MS or SRS as the first-line treatment from a nationwide prospective multicenter registry in mainland China. The authors used propensity score-matched methods to balance baseline characteristics between the MS and SRS groups. The primary outcomes were long-term hemorrhagic stroke or death, and the secondary outcomes were long-term obliteration and neurological outcomes. Subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses with different study designs were performed to confirm the stability of our findings. RESULTS: Of the 4286 consecutive AVMs in the registry from August 2011 to December 2021; 1604 patients were eligible. After matching, 244 unruptured and 442 ruptured AVMs remained for the final analysis. The mean follow-up duration was 7.0 years in the unruptured group and 6.1 years in the ruptured group. In the comparison of primary outcomes, SRS was associated with a higher risk of hemorrhagic stroke or death both in the unruptured and ruptured AVMs (unruptured: hazard ratio 4.06, 95% CI: 1.15-14.41; ruptured: hazard ratio 4.19, 95% CI: 1.58-11.15). In terms of the secondary outcomes, SRS was also observed to have a significant disadvantage in long-term obliteration [unruptured: odds ratio (OR) 0.01, 95% CI: 0.00-0.04; ruptured: OR 0.09, 95% CI: 0.05-0.15]. However, it should be noted that SRS may have advantages in preventing neurofunctional decline (unruptured: OR 0.56, 95% CI: 0.27-1.14; ruptured: OR 0.41, 95% CI: 0.23-0.76). The results of subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses were consistent in trend but with slightly varied powers.

23258505,Natural history of cerebral arteriovenous malformations and the risk of hemorrhage after radiosurgery.,"The annual hemorrhage rate of intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) varies from 2 to 4%. In a patient with decades of life ahead, the cumulative risk of hemorrhage is significant. AVMs exhibiting characteristics such as deep venous drainage, venous stenosis, associated aneurysms and feeders from perforators are associated with an elevated risk of hemorrhage. We reviewed 1,400 AVM patients who underwent Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) at the University of Virginia between 1989 and 2009. The dose selection was based on the size and location of the nidus. The mean prescription dose was 21.2 Gy (range 5-36 Gy), and the mean maximum dose was 39.4 Gy (range 10-60 Gy). A total of 657 patients suffered 803 hemorrhagic events over 42,495 risk years before GKS. Assuming that these patients were at risk for hemorrhage since birth, the annual hemorrhage rate was 2.0%. If we calculate the hemorrhage rate after the diagnosis of the AVMs, the hemorrhage rate was 6.6%. Following GKS and prior to a radiographic documented obliteration, the annual hemorrhage rate was 2.5%; this rate is very similar to the 2.0% one computed prior to radiosurgery by assuming AVMs to be congenital.

36702500,Radiation-Induced Changes Associated with Obliteration of Brain AVMs after Repeat Radiosurgery.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Radiation-induced changes can occur after stereotactic radiosurgery for brain AVMs, potentially causing symptomatic complications. We evaluated the incidence of such changes and the efficacy of repeat gamma knife radiosurgery for incompletely obliterated AVMs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 150 patients who underwent gamma knife radiosurgery for AVMs between 2002 and 2020; twenty-five underwent further radiosurgical procedures for incompletely obliterated AVMs. We recorded the median margin doses at the first (median, 20 Gy; range, 12-23 Gy; AVM volume, 0.026-31.3 mL) and subsequent procedures (median, 18 Gy; range, 12-23 Gy; AVM volume, 0.048-9.2 mL). RESULTS: After the first treatment, radiologic radiation-induced changes developed in 48 (32%) patients, eight of whom had symptomatic changes. After repeat gamma knife radiosurgery, 16 of 25 patients achieved complete AVM obliteration (64%). The development of radiation-induced changes after the first treatment was significantly associated with successful obliteration by subsequent radiosurgery (OR = 24.0, 95% CI 1.20-483, P = .007). Radiation-induced changes occurred in only 5 (20%) patients who underwent a second gamma knife radiosurgery, one of whom experienced transient neurologic deficits. Between the first and repeat gamma knife radiosurgery procedures, there was no significant difference in radiologic and symptomatic radiation-induced changes (P = .35 and P = 1.0, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Radiation-induced changes after the first gamma knife radiosurgery were associated with AVM obliteration after a repeat procedure. The risk of symptomatic radiation-induced changes did not increase with retreatment. When the first procedure fails to achieve complete AVM obliteration, a favorable outcome can be achieved by a repeat gamma knife radiosurgery, even if radiation-induced changes occur after the first treatment.",2023 Feb,2023,AJNR.

36868088,Curative embolization of ruptured pediatric cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"INTRODUCTION: Embolization with the intention to cure has not been well studied in ruptured arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Furthermore, the role of primary curative embolization of pediatric AVMs is uncertain. Hence, we aimed to characterize the safety and efficacy of curative embolization of ruptured pediatric AVMs and assess predictors of obliteration and complications. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all pediatric (≤18 years) patients who underwent curative embolization of ruptured AVMs was conducted in two institutions between 2010 and 2022. The efficacy (complete angiographic obliteration after the last embolization session), recurrence (radiological recurrence of the lesion after confirmed obliteration in follow-up imaging), and safety (procedure-related complications and mortality) of the procedure were evaluated. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients (38 females; mean age 12.4 ± 3.4 years) underwent a total of 109 embolization sessions. Median follow-up time was 18 months after embolization (ranged from 2 to 47 months). Complete angiographic obliteration was achieved in 42 patients (62%). In 30 patients (44%) the AVM was occluded with a single embolization session. Recurrence of a totally embolized lesion occurred in 9 patients (13%). Thirteen complications (11.9% of procedures) were observed, and no deaths were reported. A nidus size > 2 cm was the only independent predictor of complete obliteration (OR = 0.16; 95% CI 0.03 - 0.77; p = 0.030). CONCLUSION: Embolization of pediatric ruptured AVMs with curative intent can achieve acceptable obliteration rates. However, recurrence after complete obliteration and procedure-related complications of curative embolization of these lesions cannot be ignored. Ruptured AVMs ≤ 2 cm are adequate to achieve complete obliteration with curative endovascular management.",2023 Apr,2023,Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,227,,107663,eng,False,S0303-8467(23)00079-3;10.1016/j.clineuro.2023.107663;S0303-8467(23)00079-3;10.1016/j.clineuro.2023.107663,Journal Article,"Female;Humans;Child;Adolescent;Treatment Outcome;Retrospective Studies;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/therapy;*Embolization, Therapeutic/methods;Angiography;*Radiosurgery/methods;Follow-Up Studies",Arteriovenous malformations;Child;Endovascular procedures
31942635,Radiosurgery for Unruptured Intervention-Naïve Pediatric Brain Arteriovenous Malformations.,"BACKGROUND: Long-term data regarding stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) as a standalone therapy for unruptured pediatric brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are incompletely defined. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate, in a multicenter, retrospective cohort study, the outcomes after SRS for unruptured, intervention-naïve pediatric AVMs. METHODS: To retrospectively analyze the International Radiosurgery Research Foundation pediatric AVM database from 1987 to 2018. Pediatric patients with unruptured, previously untreated AVMs who underwent SRS were included. The primary endpoint was a composite of hemorrhagic stroke, death, or permanently symptomatic radiation-induced changes. RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 101 patients (mean follow-up 80.8 mo). The primary endpoint occurred in 14%, comprising hemorrhagic stroke, death, and permanent radiation-induced changes in 6%, 3%, and 8%, respectively. Estimated probabilities of the primary endpoint were 5.2%, 10.8%, and 23.0% at 2, 5, and 10 yr, respectively. Estimated probabilities of AVM obliteration at 5 and 10 yr were 64% and 82%, respectively. Single SRS treatment (P = .007) and higher margin dose (P = .005) were predictors of obliteration. Subgroup analysis of Spetzler-Martin grade I-III AVMs estimated primary endpoint probabilities of 3.7%, 8.4%, and 18.7% at 2, 5, and 10 yr, respectively. CONCLUSION: Treatment of unruptured, intervention-naïve AVMs in the pediatric population with SRS carries an approximately 2% annual risk of morbidity and mortality, which appears to plateau after 10 yr.

36057117,Preoperative flow analysis of arteriovenous malformations and obliteration response after stereotactic radiosurgery.,"OBJECTIVE: Morphological and angioarchitectural features of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) have been widely described and associated with outcomes; however, few studies have conducted a quantitative analysis of AVM flow. The authors examined brain AVM flow and transit time on angiograms using direct visual analysis and a computer-based method and correlated these factors with the obliteration response after Gamma Knife radiosurgery. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted at a single institution using a prospective registry of patients managed from January 2013 to December 2019: 71 patients were analyzed using a visual method of flow determination and 38 were analyzed using a computer-based method. After comparison and validation of the two methods, obliteration response was correlated to flow analysis, demographic, angioarchitectural, and dosimetric data. RESULTS: The mean AVM volume was 3.84 cm3 (range 0.64-19.8 cm3), 32 AVMs (45%) were in critical functional locations, and the mean margin radiosurgical dose was 18.8 Gy (range 16-22 Gy). Twenty-seven AVMs (38%) were classified as high flow, 37 (52%) as moderate flow, and 7 (10%) as low flow. Complete obliteration was achieved in 44 patients (62%) at the time of the study; the mean time to obliteration was 28 months for low-flow, 34 months for moderate-flow, and 47 months for high-flow AVMs. Univariate and multivariate analyses of factors predicting obliteration included AVM nidus volume, age, and flow. Adverse radiation effects were identified in 5 patients (7%), and 67 patients (94%) remained free of any functional deterioration during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: AVM flow analysis and categorization in terms of transit time are useful predictors of the probability of and the time to obliteration. The authors believe that a more quantitative understanding of flow can help to guide stereotactic radiosurgery treatment and set accurate outcome expectations.",2023 Apr 1,2023,Journal of neurosurgery,138,4,944-954,eng,True,10.3171/2022.7.JNS221008;10.3171/2022.7.JNS221008,Journal Article,Humans;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects/methods;Treatment Outcome;Follow-Up Studies;Retrospective Studies;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/radiotherapy/surgery,Gamma Knife radiosurgery;angioarchitecture;digital subtraction angiography;intracranial arteriovenous malformations;obliteration rate;stereotactic radiosurgery;vascular disorders
25175437,Volume-staged versus dose-staged radiosurgery outcomes for large intracranial arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECT: The aim in this paper was to compare the outcomes of dose-staged and volume-staged stereotactic radio-surgery (SRS) in the treatment of large (> 10 cm(3)) arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed using PubMed. Studies written in the English language with at least 5 patients harboring large (> 10 cm(3)) AVMs treated with dose- or volume-staged SRS that reported post-treatment outcomes data were selected for review. Demographic information, radiosurgical treatment parameters, and post-SRS outcomes and complications were analyzed for each of these studies. RESULTS: The mean complete obliteration rates for the dose- and volume-staged groups were 22.8% and 47.5%, respectively. Complete obliteration was demonstrated in 30 of 161 (18.6%) and 59 of 120 (49.2%) patients in the dose- and volume-staged groups, respectively. The mean rates of symptomatic radiation-induced changes were 13.5% and 13.6% in dose- and volume-staged groups, respectively. The mean rates of cumulative post-SRS latency period hemorrhage were 12.3% and 17.8% in the dose- and volume-staged groups, respectively. The mean rates of post-SRS mortality were 3.2% and 4.6% in dose- and volume-staged groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Volume-staged SRS affords higher obliteration rates and similar complication rates compared with dose-staged SRS. Thus, volume-staged SRS may be a superior approach for large AVMs that are not amenable to single-session SRS. Staged radiosurgery should be considered as an efficacious component of multimodality AVM management.",2014 Sep,2014,Neurosurgical focus,37,3,E18,eng,False,10.3171/2014.5.FOCUS14205;10.3171/2014.5.FOCUS14205,Journal Article;Review;Systematic Review,"Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;PubMed/statistics & numerical data;Radiosurgery/*standards;Treatment Outcome",AVM = arteriovenous malformation;GKRS = Gamma Knife radiosurgery;HSRT = hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy;RIC = radiation-induced change; SRS = stereotactic radiosurgery;arteriovenous malformation;dose-staged;review;staging;stereotactic radiosurgery;volume-staged
26732284,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for deep intracranial arteriovenous malformations, part 2: Basal ganglia and thalamus arteriovenous malformations.","The aim of this review is to critically analyze the outcomes following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for arteriovenous malformations (AVM) of the basal ganglia and thalamus. The management of these deep-seated lesions continues to challenge neurosurgeons. Basal ganglia and thalamic AVM show a higher risk of hemorrhage, and an associated devastating morbidity and mortality, as compared to AVM in more superficial locations. Any of the currently available treatment modalities may fail or result in iatrogenic neurologic deterioration. Recent evidence from A Randomized Trial of Unruptured Brain AVM (ARUBA) further deters aggressive approaches that carry a significant risk of treatment-related adverse events. Microsurgical resection, endovascular embolization and SRS all play a role in the treatment of AVM. SRS is an effective therapeutic option for AVM of the thalamus and basal ganglia that are deemed high risk for resection. SRS offers acceptable obliteration rates, with generally lower risks of hemorrhage occurring during the latency period compared to the AVM natural history. Considering that incompletely obliterated lesions still harbor the potential for rupture, additional treatments such as repeat SRS and microsurgical resection should be considered when complete obliteration is not achieved by an initial SRS procedure. Patients with AVM of the basal ganglia and thalamus require continued clinical and radiologic observation and follow-up after SRS, even after angiographic obliteration has been confirmed.",2016 Feb,2016,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society,24,,37-42,eng,False,S0967-5868(15)00612-8;10.1016/j.jocn.2015.11.006;S0967-5868(15)00612-8;10.1016/j.jocn.2015.11.006,Journal Article;Review,Basal Ganglia/*surgery;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;Radiosurgery/*methods;Thalamus/*surgery,Basal ganglia;Gamma Knife radiosurgery;Intracranial arteriovenous malformations;Intracranial hemorrhages;Outcome prediction;Thalamus
29718388,The use of Hypofractionated Radiosurgery for the Treatment of Intracranial Lesions Unsuitable for Single-Fraction Radiosurgery.,"Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is commonly used in the treatment of brain metastases, benign tumors, and arteriovenous malformations (AVM). Single-fraction radiosurgery, though ubiquitous, is limited by lesion size and location. In these cases, hypofractionated radiosurgery (hfSRS) offers comparable efficacy and toxicity. We review the recent literature concerning hfSRS in the treatment of brain metastases, benign tumors, and AVMs that are poorly suited for single-fraction SRS. Published retrospective analyses suggest that local control rates for brain metastases and benign tumors, as well as the rates of AVM obliteration, following hfSRS treatment are comparable to those reported for single-fraction SRS. Additionally, the toxicities from hypofractionated treatment appear comparable to those seen with single-fractioned SRS to small lesions.",2018 Nov 1,2018,Neurosurgery,83,5,850-857,eng,False,10.1093/neuros/nyy145;4990001;10.1093/neuros/nyy145,Journal Article;Review,"Brain Neoplasms/*surgery;Dose Fractionation, Radiation;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;Radiosurgery/*methods;Treatment Outcome",
30544318,Volume-staged Gamma Knife radiosurgery for orbital venous malformations.,"OBJECTIVEThis article is a preliminary evaluation of the efficacy of volume-staged Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) in the treatment of patients with orbital venous malformations (OVMs).METHODSTwenty patients with moderate to large OVMs were treated with volume-staged GKRS between March 2005 and October 2015. The series included 8 male and 12 female patients with an average age of 22.5 years (range 9-45 years). The diagnoses were confirmed intraoperatively and at pathological examination in 14 cases and presumed in accordance with clinical and imaging findings in 6 cases. The median OVM volume was 12.2 cm3 (range 7.1-34.6 cm3). The median interval between stages was 10 months (range 6-12 months). The tumor margin dose for each stage ranged from 11.0 to 13.5 Gy. The median duration of follow-up was 45.5 months (range 18-98 months).RESULTSPeriodically scheduled MRI studies demonstrated evidence of a significant reduction of the original OVM volume in all cases. Visual acuity (VA) was preserved in 18 cases (90%). Five patients (25%) experienced vision improvement of varying degrees, and 13 (65%) experienced long-term preservation of VA at their pre-GKRS level. Deterioration in VA was observed in only 2 cases (10%). MRI demonstrated OVM regression after treatment in all cases, and all patients were found to have reduction of exophthalmos after volume-staged GKRS. Follow-up MRI revealed recurrence in only 1 case (5%). Three patients (15%) developed transient conjunctival edema.CONCLUSIONSThis retrospective investigation indicates that volume-staged GKRS provides an effective management option in selected patients with OVMs, providing excellent visual outcomes.

19853800,Endovascular treatment of intracranial arteriovenous malformation.,"Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the brain are vascular lesions in which an abnormal tangle or nidus of vessels permits pathologic shunting of blood flow from the arterial to the venous tree without an intervening capillary bed. With brain imaging techniques, an increasing number of AVMs are detected before they hemorrhage, leading to new considerations and modifications of interdisciplinary management strategies. Treatment options include endovascular embolization, microsurgical resection, radiosurgery, medical management, or a combination of these.

33017465,Stereotactic Radiosurgery With Versus Without Embolization for Brain Arteriovenous Malformations.,"BACKGROUND: Prior comparisons of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) treated using stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) with or without embolization were inherently flawed, due to differences in the pretreatment nidus volumes. OBJECTIVE: To compare the outcomes of embolization and SRS, vs SRS alone for AVMs using pre-embolization malformation features. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed International Radiosurgery Research Foundation AVM databases from 1987 to 2018. Patients were categorized into the embolization and SRS (E + SRS) or SRS alone (SRS-only) cohorts. The 2 cohorts were matched in a 1:1 ratio using propensity scores. Primary outcome was defined as AVM obliteration. Secondary outcomes were post-SRS hemorrhage, all-cause mortality, radiologic and symptomatic radiation-induced changes (RIC), and cyst formation. RESULTS: The matched cohorts each comprised 101 patients. Crude AVM obliteration rates were similar between the matched E + SRS vs SRS-only cohorts (48.5% vs 54.5%; odds ratio = 0.788, P = .399). Cumulative probabilities of obliteration at 3, 4, 5, and 6 yr were also similar between the E + SRS (33.0%, 46.4%, 56.2%, and 60.8%, respectively) and SRS-only (32.9%, 46.2%, 56.0%, and 60.6%, respectively) cohorts (subhazard ratio (SHR) = 1.005, P = .981). Cumulative probabilities of radiologic RIC at 3, 4, 5, and 6 yr were lower in the E + SRS (25.0%, 25.7%, 26.7%, and 26.7%, respectively) vs SRS-only (45.3%, 46.2%, 47.8%, and 47.8%, respectively) cohort (SHR = 0.478, P = .004). Symptomatic and asymptomatic embolization-related complication rates were 8.3% and 18.6%, respectively. Rates of post-SRS hemorrhage, all-cause mortality, symptomatic RIC, and cyst formation were similar between the matched cohorts.

35439625,Gamma Knife Radiosurgery for Brain Arteriovenous Malformations: A 15-Year Single-Center Experience in Southern Vietnam.,"BACKGROUND: In the present study, we aimed to identify the obliteration outcomes, complications, and predictors in gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) treatment of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) at a tertiary center in a developing country in a 15-year experience. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data and GKRS procedures of patients who had undergone GKRS from 2006 to 2011 (cohort 1) and from 2011 to 2020 (cohort 2) at Cho Ray Hospital, Vietnam. The exclusion criteria included patients with <24 months of follow-up without obliteration or AVM-related hemorrhage during the study period. RESULTS: A total of 870 patients were included in the final analysis. The patients in cohort 1 had had significantly smaller AVMs (8.4 ± 11.6 cm(3) vs. 11.2 ± 12.8 cm(3); P < 0.001), and the AVMs were less frequently located in eloquent locations (46.6% vs. 65.5%; P < 0.001) than in cohort 2. The mean follow-up time was 49.6 ± 22.6 months (range, 5.9-102.6). The overall AVM obliteration rate was 66.6%. Cohort 1 had a significantly higher rate of complete obliteration compared with cohort 2 (81.0% vs. 55.1%; P < 0.001). The post-GKRS annual hemorrhage risk was 1.0%. Significant radiosurgery-induced brain edema and radiosurgery-induced cyst formation was reported in 24 (2.6%) and 4 (0.5%) patients in cohorts 1 and 2, respectively. Using multivariate analysis, we identified prior AVM hemorrhage (hazard ratio [HR], 1.430; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.182-1.729), a higher margin dose (HR, 1.136; 95% CI, 1.086-1.188), a noneloquent location (HR, 0.765; 95% CI, 0.647-0.905), and smaller AVM volume (HR, 0.982; 95% CI, 0.968-0.997) as predictive factors for obliteration.

This study aimed to investigate the risk of RIMs after SRS for BAVMs. The outcomes of patients who underwent single-session SRS for BAVMs at our institution and were followed for ≥ 5 years were analyzed to calculate the incidence of RIMs. In addition, a systematic review was conducted using the existing literature reporting RIMs after SRS for BAVMs in compliance with the PRISMA guideline. Regarding the in-hospital analysis, only one (0.18%) RIM (gliosarcoma) was observed among 569 patients, with a median follow-up period of 151 months (interquartile range, 103-255 months). The 15, 20, and 25-year cumulative incidences of RIMs were 0%, 0%, and 1.01%, respectively, whereas the overall incidence rate was 0.12 per 1,000 patient-years. In the systematic review, 14 studies were included, with the incidence of RIMs ranging from 0.00 to 0.24%. Eight patients with RIMs were identified, and the most common pathology was glioblastoma. The median time until the diagnosis of RIM was 7.1 years (range, 4-19 years) after SRS, and their clinical courses were largely dismal, with the post-diagnosis survival periods being 1-10 months. RIM constitutes an extremely rare but potentially fatal complication following SRS for BAVMs, with its incidence rate being at most 0.24%.",2024 Nov 26,2024,Neurosurgical review,47,1,870,eng,False,10.1007/s10143-024-03093-6;870;10.1007/s10143-024-03093-6;3093;10.1007/s10143-024-03093-6,Journal Article;Review;Systematic Review,"Humans;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects/methods;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery;Adult;Female;Retrospective Studies;Male;Middle Aged;*Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced;Brain Neoplasms/radiotherapy/surgery;Aged;Young Adult",Arteriovenous malformation;Glioblastoma;Gliosarcoma;Late radiation-induced complications;Radiation-induced malignancies;Stereotactic radiosurgery

OBJECTIVE: We describe our protocol of frameless GKRS using DSA while maintaining high spatial resolution for precision. METHODS: This study is a retrospective review of patients with unruptured AVMs who underwent frameless GKRS. Magnetic resonance imaging and 3-dimensional DSA were obtained without a stereotactic frame for all patients. The imaging studies were merged for contouring of the AVM nidus. During GKRS treatment, patients were immobilized using an individually molded thermoplastic mask. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were included in the analysis. The median age is 45.0 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 28.0-55.0). The median nidus size is 3.0 cm (IQR: 2.0-3.4). One patient had a Spetzler-Martin grade I, 11 had a grade II, 11 had a grade III, 6 had a grade IV, and 2 had a grade V AVM. Eleven patients underwent preradiosurgical embolization, 3 patients had previous microsurgical resection and/or embolization, and 1 patient had prior radiosurgery. The median administered dose was 20 Gy (IQR: 18.0-21.0). All patients completed their treatment with the planned radiation dose without complications. CONCLUSION: This is the first study that integrates DSA in the treatment planning of brain AVMs using GKRS without utilizing a stereotactic head frame. Frameless GKRS provides numerous advantages over frame-based techniques including improved patient experience and the capability of fractionation and thus expanding the eligibility of more AVMs for radiosurgery, while maintaining high spatial resolution of the AVM using angiography data.",2022 Aug,2022,World neurosurgery,164,,e808-e813,eng,False,S1878-8750(22)00676-3;10.1016/j.wneu.2022.05.046;S1878-8750(22)00676-3;10.1016/j.wneu.2022.05.046,Journal Article,"Angiography, Digital Subtraction;Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/radiotherapy/surgery;Middle Aged;*Radiosurgery/methods;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome",Arteriovenous malformation;Gamma Knife;Stereotactic radiosurgery
36738962,Patient Selection in a Pragmatic Study on the Management of Patients with Brain Arteriovenous Malformations.,"BACKGROUND: The Treatment of Brain Arteriovenous Malformations Study (TOBAS) is an all-inclusive pragmatic study comprising 2 randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Patients excluded from the RCTs are followed in parallel treatment and observation registries, allowing a comparison between RCT and registry patients. METHODS: The first randomized clinical trial (RCT-1) offers 1:1 randomized allocation of intervention versus conservative management for patients with arteriovenous malformation (AVM). The second randomized clinical trial (RCT-2) allocates 1:1 pre-embolization or no pre-embolization to surgery or radiosurgery patients judged treatable with or without embolization. Characteristics of RCT patients are reported and compared to registry patients. RESULTS: From June 2014 to May 2021, 1010 patients with AVM were recruited; 498 patients were observed and 373 were included in the treatment registries. Randomized allocation in RCT-1 was applied to 139 (26%) of the 512 patients (including 127 of 222 [57%] with unruptured AVMs) considered for curative treatment. RCT-1 AVM patients differed (in rupture status, Spetzler-Martin grade and baseline modified Rankin Score) from those in the observation or treatment registries (P < 0.001). Most patients had small (<3 cm; 71%) low-grade (Spetzler-Martin I-II; 64%) unruptured (91%) AVMs. The allocated management was conservative (n = 71) or curative (n = 68), using surgery (n = 39), embolization (n = 16), or stereotactic radiosurgery (n = 13). Pre-embolization was considered for 179/309 (58%) patients allocated/assigned to surgery or stereotactic radiosurgery; 87/179 (49%) were included in RCT-2. RCT-2 patient AVMs differed in size, eloquence and grade from patients of the pre-embolization registry (P < 0.01). Most had small (<3 cm in 82%) low-grade (83%) AVMs in non-eloquent brain (64%).

We present the experience in linear accelerator-based SRS for cerebral AVM treated over 14 years. We prospectively followed 67 patients with 69 AVM treated with SRS from 1994 to 2008, inclusive. The mean patient age was 37 years (range 7-69) with 36 women and 31 men. The median AVM size, as defined by maximal diameter, was 2.5 cm (range 0.5-4.6 cm) and the median marginal dose was 18 Gy in one fraction. The crude angiographic obliteration rate was 55% with a 3 and 5 year actuarial rate of 39% and 65%, respectively. Median time to obliteration was 4.2 years. Higher treatment dose (p<0.0001) and smaller maximal AVM diameter (p=0.002) were associated with an increased obliteration rate. There were no deaths from treatment. Post-treatment neurological complications occurred in 10 patients (15%) including hemorrhage in two. Twelve patients (18%) required a second SRS procedure. Larger AVM diameter was associated with increased odds of requiring re-treatment (p=0.02). Radiosurgery for intracerebral AVM is a non-invasive therapeutic option with low morbidity and a reasonable likelihood of nidus obliteration.

METHODS: A retrospective study of 148 patients with an intracranial AVM who underwent SRS between September 2005 and June 2018 and had ≥1 radiological follow-up (early magnetic resonance imaging) 12-18 months after SRS was performed to analyze the correlation between PH (graded from 0 to 2) and AVM obliteration. RESULTS: Of the 148 patients, 95 were male. The mean patient age was 27.7 ± 12.4 years. Of the 148 AVMs, 105 (70.9%) were obliterated at a median follow-up of 27 months (interquartile range, 14-48 months). The cumulative 3-, 5-, 10-year obliteration rate was 51.8%, 70.8%, and 91.8%, respectively. New-onset PH was observed in 58 AVMs (39.2%; 50 obliterated and 8 not obliterated). No association was found between the pretreatment variables or dose delivered and the development of PH. Grade 2 PH was associated with the risk of symptoms developing compared with grade 1 PH (37.5% vs. 4%; P = 0.002). Symptomatic PH was more likely to develop in patients with a larger AVM (P = 0.05). On multivariate analysis, the presence of a single draining vein (odds ratio [OR], 2.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-6.8), a lower median AVM volume (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.6-0.89), a mean marginal radiation dose (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.02-1.64), and the presence of PH (OR, 3.16; 95% CI, 1.29-7.71) were independent predictors of AVM obliteration. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of PH after SRS for AVM was 39.2%. PH was an independent predictor of AVM obliteration after SRS.

37665224,Early Treatment of Ruptured Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformations: Analysis of Neurological Outcomes and Health Care Costs.,"BACKGROUND: The timing of surgical resection is controversial when managing ruptured arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and varies considerably among centers. OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively analyze clinical outcomes and hospital costs associated with delayed treatment in a ruptured cerebral AVM patient cohort. METHODS: Patients undergoing surgical treatment for a ruptured cerebral AVM (January 1, 2015-December 31, 2020) were retrospectively analyzed. Patients who underwent emergent treatment of a ruptured AVM because of acute herniation were excluded, as were those treated >180 days after rupture. Patients were stratified by the timing of surgical intervention relative to AVM rupture into early (postbleed days 1-20) and delayed (postbleed days 21-180) treatment cohorts. RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients were identified. The early treatment cohort comprised 75 (86%) patients. The mean (SD) length of time between AVM rupture and surgical resection was 5 (5) days in the early cohort and 73 (60) days in the delayed cohort ( P < .001). The cohorts did not differ with respect to patient demographics, AVM size, Spetzler-Martin grade, frequency of preoperative embolization, or severity of clinical presentation ( P ≥ .15). Follow-up neurological status was equivalent between the cohorts ( P = .65). The associated mean health care costs were higher in the delayed treatment cohort ($241 597 [$99 363]) than in the early treatment cohort ($133 989 [$110 947]) ( P = .02). After adjustment for length of stay, each day of delayed treatment increased cost by a mean of $2465 (95% CI = $967-$3964, P = .002). CONCLUSION: Early treatment of ruptured AVMs was associated with significantly lower health care costs than delayed treatment, but surgical and neurological outcomes were equivalent.",2024 Jan 1,2024,Neurosurgery,94,1,212-216,eng,False,10.1227/neu.0000000000002641;00006123-990000000-00860;10.1227/neu.0000000000002641,Journal Article,"Humans;Treatment Outcome;Retrospective Studies;*Embolization, Therapeutic;Rupture;Health Care Costs;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery/complications;*Radiosurgery/methods",
36087319,Natural history and treatment of deep-seated brain arteriovenous malformations in pediatric patients.,"OBJECTIVE: Pediatric deep brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) represent a unique management challenge given their higher cumulative risk of hemorrhage as well as a higher risk of treatment. Better understanding of hemorrhage risk in this patient population will lead to a better decision-making process for patient management. METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed their institutional bAVM database from 1990 to 2019 and included patients younger than 21 years who had deep-seated bAVMs. They present the annual hemorrhage risk, during the natural history and after treatment, and functional outcomes. RESULTS: Thirty-one pediatric patients were included in this study (13 males and 18 females) with a mean age of 11.8 (SD 4.4) years. The most frequent presenting symptoms were headache (54.8%), weakness (38.7%), and seizure (22.6%). The mean follow-up duration was 13.14 (SD 12.5) years, during which 7 (22.6%) AVMs were obliterated, 10 (32.3%) individuals experienced hemorrhage, and the modified Rankin Scale score worsened in 8 (25.8%) patients. The annual natural history risk of hemorrhage was 3.24% per patient, and the overall annual hemorrhage risk after treatment was 1.98% per patient. In particular, the risk was reduced to 0.64% per patient in the stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) group. Non-White race showed a trend of higher rupture at presentation (OR 5 [95% CI 0.84-41.68], p = 0.09). Female sex was associated with higher odds (OR 13.076 [95% CI 1.424-333.591], p = 0.048) and SRS was associated with lower odds (OR 0.122 [95% CI 0.011-0.862], p = 0.049) of follow-up hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: Given the substantial cumulative risk of lifelong hemorrhagic stroke in pediatric patients, timely definitive treatment is warranted.

36137082,Image-guided robotic radiosurgery for the treatment of arteriovenous malformations.,"BACKGROUND: Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are challenging lesions, often requiring multimodal interventions; however, data on the efficacy of stereotactic radiosurgery for cerebral AVMs are limited. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and radiographic results following robotic radiosurgery, alone or in combination with endovascular treatment, and to investigate factors associated with obliteration and complications in patients with AVM. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical and imaging characteristics of 123 patients with AVMs of all Spetzler-Martin grades treated at two institutions by robotic radiosurgery in single-fraction doses (CyberKnife). Embolization was performed before radiosurgery in a subset of patients to attempt to downgrade the lesions. Factors associated with AVM obliteration and complications (toxicity) were identified via univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 48.1 months (range, 3.6-123 months). Five patients were lost to follow-up. The obliteration rate in the 59 patients with a follow-up period exceeding four years was 72.8%. Complete obliteration and partial remission were achieved in 67 (56.8%) and 31 (26.3%) cases, respectively, whereas no change was observed in 20 cases (17.8%). Embolization was performed in 54/123 cases (43.9%). Complete and partial obliteration were achieved in 29 (55.7%) and 14 (26.9%) embolized patients, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, the factors associated with obliteration were age (p = .018) and the Spetzler-Martin grade (p = .041). Treatment-induced toxicity (radiation necrosis and/or edema) was observed in 15 cases (12.7%), rebleeding occurred in three cases (2.5%), and the rate of mortality associated with rebleeding was 1.7%. CONCLUSIONS: CyberKnife radiosurgery is a valid approach for treating AVMs of all Spetzler-Martin-grades, with satisfactory obliteration rates, low toxicity, and a relatively rare incidence of rebleeding.",2022,2022,PloS one,17,9,e0266744,eng,True,10.1371/journal.pone.0266744;e0266744;PONE-D-21-20180;10.1371/journal.pone.0266744,Journal Article,Follow-Up Studies;Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/radiotherapy;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects/methods;Retrospective Studies;*Robotic Surgical Procedures/adverse effects;Treatment Outcome,
38843970,Embolization Prior to Radiosurgery in Treatment of Arteriovenous Malformations: Defining Radiosurgery Target Dose with Nidal Volume Reduction.,"INTRODUCTION: Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) can be treated with observation, surgery, embolization, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), or a combination of therapies. SRS has been used for AVMs that pose a high risk of surgery, such as in deep or eloquent anatomic locations. Smaller AVMs, <3 cm, have been shown to have higher rates of complete obliteration after SRS. For AVMs that are a larger size, embolization prior to SRS has been used to reduce the size of the AVM nidus. In this study we analyzed embolization prior to SRS to reduce nidal volume and describe imaging techniques to target for SRS post embolization. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all patients at a single academic institution treated with embolization prior to SRS for treatment of AVMs. We then used contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to contour AVM volumes based on pre-embolization imaging and compared to post-embolization imaging. Planned AVM volume prior to embolization was then compared to actual treated AVM volume. RESULTS: We identified 11 patients treated with embolization prior to SRS from 2011-2023. Median AVM nidal volume prior to embolization was 7.69 mL and post embolization was 3.61 ML (P < 0.01). There was a 45.5% obliteration rate at follow up in our series, with 2 minor complications related to radiosurgery. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, embolization prior to SRS resulted in a statistically significant reduction in AVM nidal volume. Therefore, embolization prior to SRS can result in dose reduction at time of SRS treatment allowing for decreased risk of SRS complications without higher embolization complication rates.",2024 Aug,2024,World neurosurgery,188,,e583-e590,eng,False,S1878-8750(24)00932-X;10.1016/j.wneu.2024.05.169;S1878-8750(24)00932-X;10.1016/j.wneu.2024.05.169,Journal Article,"Humans;*Radiosurgery/methods;Retrospective Studies;*Embolization, Therapeutic/methods;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/therapy/surgery;Female;Male;Adult;Middle Aged;Treatment Outcome;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Young Adult;Adolescent;Aged",Arteriovenous malformation;Contrast enhanced MRI;Endovascular embolization;Stereotactic radiosurgery
36907366,Age-Dependent Hemorrhage Risk and Obliteration Benefit After Radiosurgery for Brain Arteriovenous Malformation.,"PURPOSE: Because patients with untreated brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVMs) are at variable risks of cerebral hemorrhage and associated mortality and morbidity, it is essential to identify patient populations who benefit most from prophylactic interventions. This study aimed to examine age-dependent differences in the therapeutic effect of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) on BAVMs. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This retrospective observational study enrolled patients with BAVMs who underwent SRS at our institution between 1990 and 2017. The primary outcome was post-SRS hemorrhage, and the secondary outcomes included nidus obliteration, post-SRS early signal changes, and mortality. To investigate age-related differences in outcomes after SRS, we performed age-stratified analyses using the Kaplan-Meier analysis and weighted logistic regression with the inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW). To address significant differences in patient baseline characteristics, we also performed inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) adjusted for possible confounders to investigate age-related differences in outcomes after SRS. RESULTS: A total of 735 patients with 738 BAVMs were stratified by age. Age-stratified analysis using a weighted logistic regression model with IPCW showed a direct correlation between patient age and post-SRS hemorrhage (odds ratio [OR], 95% confidence interval [CI], and P value: 2.20, 1.34-3.63, and .002 at 18 months; 1.86, 1.17-2.93, and .008 at 36 months; and 1.61, 1.05-2.48, and .030 at 54 months, respectively). The age-stratified analysis also showed an inverse relationship between age and obliteration over the first 42 months after SRS (OR, 95% CI, and P value: 0.05, 0.02-0.12, and <.001 at 6 months; 0.55, 0.44-0.70, and <.001 at 24 months; and 0.76, 0.63-0.91, and .002 at 42 months, respectively). These results were also confirmed with the IPTW analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis demonstrated that patients' age at SRS is significantly associated with hemorrhage and the nidus obliteration rate after treatment. In particular, younger patients are more likely to exhibit reduced cerebral hemorrhages and achieve earlier nidus obliteration compared with older patients.",2023 Aug 1,2023,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",116,5,1126-1134,eng,True,S0360-3016(23)00213-4;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2023.02.059;S0360-3016(23)00213-4;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2023.02.059,Journal Article;Observational Study,"Humans;Child, Preschool;Treatment Outcome;Follow-Up Studies;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects/methods;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/radiotherapy;Brain;Retrospective Studies;Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology",
31760534,Cost determinants in management of brain arteriovenous malformations.,"INTRODUCTION: There is little data on the cost of treating brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). The goal of this study then is to identify cost determinants in multimodal management of brain AVMs. METHODS: One hundred forty patients with brain AVMs prospectively enrolled in the UCSF brain AVM registry and treated between 2012 and 2015 were included in the study. Patient and AVM characteristics, treatment type, and length of stay and radiographic evidence of obliteration were collected from the registry. We then calculated the cost of all inpatient and outpatient encounters, interventions, and imaging attributable to the AVM. We used generalized linear models to test whether there was an association between patient and AVM characteristics, treatment type, and cost and length of stay. We tested whether the proportion of patients with radiographic evidence of obliteration differed between treatment modalities using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: The overall median cost of treatment and interquartile range was $77,865 (49,566-107,448). Surgery with preoperative embolization was the costliest treatment at $91,948 (79,914-140,600), while radiosurgery was the least at $20,917 (13,915-35,583). In multi-predictor analyses, hemorrhage, Spetzler-Martin grade, and treatment type were significant predictors of cost. Patients who had surgery had significantly higher rates of obliteration compared with radiosurgery patients. CONCLUSIONS: Hemorrhage, AVM grade, and treatment modality are significant cost determinants in AVM management. Surgery with preoperative embolization was the costliest treatment and radiosurgery the least; however, surgical cases had significantly higher rates of obliteration.",2020 Jan,2020,Acta neurochirurgica,162,1,169-173,eng,False,10.1007/s00701-019-04134-6;10.1007/s00701-019-04134-6;10.1007/s00701-019-04134-6,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Child;Costs and Cost Analysis;Embolization, Therapeutic/adverse effects/*economics;Female;*Health Care Costs;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/economics/pathology/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Postoperative Hemorrhage/*economics;Radiosurgery/adverse effects/*economics",Brain arteriovenous malformation;Cost;Cost-effectiveness
35594883,Compactness index: a radiosurgery outcome predictor for patients with unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVE: The goal of the study was to define and quantify brain arteriovenous malformation (bAVM) compactness and to assess its effect on outcomes after Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for unruptured bAVMs. METHODS: Unsupervised machine learning with fuzzy c-means clustering was used to differentiate the tissue constituents of bAVMs on T2-weighted MR images. The percentages of vessel, brain, and CSF were quantified. The proposed compactness index, defined as the ratio of vasculature tissue to brain tissue, categorized bAVM morphology into compact, intermediate, and diffuse types according to the tertiles of this index. The outcomes of interest were complete obliteration and radiation-induced changes (RICs). RESULTS: A total of 209 unruptured bAVMs treated with GKRS were retrospectively included. The median imaging and clinical follow-up periods were 49.2 and 72.3 months, respectively. One hundred seventy-three bAVMs (82.8%) achieved complete obliteration after a median latency period of 43.3 months. The rates of RIC and permanent RIC were 76.1% and 3.8%, respectively. Post-GKRS hemorrhage occurred in 14 patients (6.7%), resulting in an annual bleeding risk of 1.0%. Compact bAVM, smaller bAVM volume, and exclusively superficial venous drainage were independent predictors of complete obliteration. Diffuse bAVM morphology, larger bAVM volume, and higher margin dose were independently associated with RICs. CONCLUSIONS: The compactness index quantitatively describes the compactness of unruptured bAVMs. Moreover, compact bAVMs may have a higher obliteration rate and a smaller risk of RICs than diffuse bAVMs. This finding could help guide decision-making regarding GKRS treatment for patients with unruptured bAVMs.",2023 Jan 1,2023,Journal of neurosurgery,138,1,241-250,eng,True,10.3171/2022.4.JNS212369;10.3171/2022.4.JNS212369,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Humans;Treatment Outcome;Follow-Up Studies;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects/methods;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic;Retrospective Studies;Brain,Gamma Knife;adverse radiation effect;arteriovenous malformation compactness;automated segmentation;complete obliteration;fuzzy c-means clustering;radiation-induced change;stereotactic radiosurgery;vascular disorders
39016379,Long-term complications and outcomes of therapeutic embolization of cerebral arteriovenous malformations: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Embolization is a promising treatment strategy for cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). However, consensus regarding the main complications or long-term outcomes of embolization in AVMs remains lacking. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the most prevalent complications and long-term outcomes in patients with AVM undergoing therapeutic embolization. DESIGN AND SETTING: This systematic review was conducted at the Federal University of Alagoas, Arapiraca, Brazil. METHODS: This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses criteria. Data were obtained from MEDLINE, PubMed, LILACS, and SciELO databases, which included the epidemiological profile of the population, characteristics of the proposed therapy, complications (hemorrhagic events and neurological deficits), and long-term outcomes (modified Rankin scale pre- and post-treatment, AVM recanalization, complete obliteration, and deaths). RESULTS: Overall, the analysis included 34 articles (2,799 patients). Grade III Spetzler-Martin AVMs were observed in 34.2% of cases. Notably, 39.3% of patients underwent embolization combined with radiosurgery. The most frequently reported long-term complication was hemorrhage, which occurred in 8.7% of patients at a mean follow-up period of 58.6 months. Further, 6.3% of patients exhibited neurological deficits after an average of 34.7 months. Complete obliteration was achieved in 51.4% of the cases after a mean period of 36 months. Recanalization of AVMs was observed in 3.5% of patients. Long-term death occurred in 4.0% of patients. CONCLUSION: Embolization of AVMs is an increasingly safe strategy with low long-term complications and satisfactory outcomes, especially in patients who have undergone combination therapies.

35080514,Imaging Markers Associated With Radiation-Induced Changes in Brain Arteriovenous Malformations After Radiosurgery.,"BACKGROUND: Radiation-induced changes (RICs) in brain tissue, seen as increased perinidal T2-weighted hyperintensity on MRI, are commonly observed in patients with brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVMs) within 2 years after Gamma Knife (Elekta) radiosurgery (GKRS). OBJECTIVE: To explore the imaging markers associated with RICs in patients with BAVMs. METHODS: We retrospectively included 106 treatment-naïve patients with BAVMs who received GKRS alone between 2011 and 2018 and had ≥24 months of clinical and MRI follow-up. Pre-GKRS angiography and MRIs were analyzed for morphological characteristics and quantitative digital subtraction angiography parameters. RIC severity was categorized as mild (grade I), moderate (grade II), or severe (grade III). Firth logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the associations between the parameters and RICs. RESULTS: Among the 106 patients, 83 (78.3%) developed RICs, with 16 categorized as grade I, 62 as grade II, and 5 as grade III. RICs were symptomatic in 19 patients (17.9%). In multivariable models, BAVMs with a volume of >5 cm3 (odds ratio [OR]: 4.322, P = .024) and neoangiogenesis on angiography before treatment (OR: 3.846, P = .029), and thrombus within nidus or drainage vein on follow-up MRI (OR: 3.679, P = .001) were independently associated with grade II or III RICs. Symptomatic RICs were more likely to develop in basal ganglia or brainstem.

Over the past decade, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has gained wider acceptance in the management of CMs, especially in those with deep location, eloquence, and where surgery is of high risk. Unlike arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), there is no imaging surrogate endpoint to confirm CM obliteration. Clinical response to SRS can only be gauged by a reduction in long-term CM hemorrhage rates. There is concern that the long-term benefits of SRS and the reduced rehemorrhage rate after a latency period of 2 years may only be a reflection of natural history. Of further concern is the development of adverse radiation effects (AREs), which were significant in the early experimental studies. The lessons learnt from that era have led to the progressive development of well-defined, lower marginal dose treatment protocols that have reported less toxicity (5%-7%) and consequently reduced morbidity. Currently, there is at least Class II, Level B evidence for use of SRS in solitary CMs with previous symptomatic hemorrhage in eloquent areas with high surgical risk. Recent prospective cohort studies observing untreated brainstem and thalamic CMs report significantly higher hemorrhage rates and neurological sequelae than the rates reported from contemporary pooled large natural history meta-analyses. Furthermore, this strengthens our recommendation for early proactive SRS in symptomatic deep-seated CMs due to the higher morbidity associated with observation and microsurgery. The key to successful outcomes for any surgical intervention is patient selection. We hope that our precis on contemporary SRS techniques in the management of CMs will assist this process.",2023 Mar-Apr,2023,Neurology India,71,Supplement,S100-S108,eng,False,10.4103/0028-3886.373639;ni_2023_71_7_100_373639;10.4103/0028-3886.373639,Journal Article,Humans;Treatment Outcome;Follow-Up Studies;*Radiosurgery/methods;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery;Brain Stem/surgery;Retrospective Studies,Cavernous Malformation;hemorrhage;seizure;stereotactic radiosurgery
26459698,Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Partially Resected Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformations.,"OBJECTIVE: Incomplete microsurgical resection of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM) occurs uncommonly. However, such patients harboring postoperative residual nidi remain exposed to the risk of AVM hemorrhage and are therefore reasonable candidates for further intervention. The goals of this retrospective case-control study are to analyze the radiosurgery outcomes for partially resected AVMs and determine the effect of prior resection on AVM radiosurgery outcomes. METHODS: We evaluated a prospective database of AVM patients treated with radiosurgery from 1989-2013. Previously resected AVMs with radiologic follow-up ≥2 years or nidus obliteration were selected for analysis and matched, in a 1:1 fashion and blinded to outcome, to previously unresected AVMs. Statistical analyses were performed to assess relationship between prior resection and AVM radiosurgery outcomes. RESULTS: The matching process yielded 88 patients in each of the previously resected and unresected AVM cohorts. In the resected AVM cohort, the actuarial AVM obliteration rates at 3 and 5 years were 47% and 75%, respectively; the rates of radiologic and symptomatic radiation-induced changes (RICs) were 10% and 3%, respectively; and the annual postradiosurgery hemorrhage risk was 1.1%. The lack of prior AVM resection (P < 0.001) and superficial AVM location (P = 0.009) were independent predictors of radiologic RIC. The actuarial rates of obliteration (P = 0.849) and postradiosurgery hemorrhage (P = 0.548) were not significantly different between the resected and unresected AVM cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Radiosurgery affords a reasonable risk-to-benefit profile for incompletely resected AVMs. For those with a small-volume residual nidus after resection, radiosurgery should be considered an effective alternative to repeat resection.",2016 Jan,2016,World neurosurgery,85,,263-72,eng,True,S1878-8750(15)01292-9;10.1016/j.wneu.2015.10.001;S1878-8750(15)01292-9;10.1016/j.wneu.2015.10.001,Comparative Study;Journal Article,"Actuarial Analysis;Adolescent;Adult;Case-Control Studies;Cohort Studies;Combined Modality Therapy;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Angiography;Male;Microsurgery/*methods;Radiosurgery/*methods;Reoperation;Retrospective Studies;Tomography, X-Ray Computed;Young Adult",Gamma Knife;Intracranial arteriovenous malformations;Microsurgery;Radiosurgery;Stroke;Vascular malformations
37026352,"Hypo-fractionated Gamma Knife Radiosurgery for Intra-cranial Pathologies: A Single-Center Prospective Analysis of Feasibility, Safety, Efficacy, and Complication Profile.","BACKGROUND: Single-session stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a proven and effective treatment modality for various benign, malignant, and functional intra-cranial pathologies. In certain situations, single-fraction SRS is limited because of lesion size and location. Hypo-fractionated gamma knife radiosurgery (hfGKRS) is an alternative approach for such unconventional indications. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility, efficacy, safety, and complication profile of hfGKRS with evaluation of different fractionation schemes and dosing patterns. METHODOLOGY: The authors prospectively evaluated 202 patients treated with frame-based hfGKRS over a 9-year period. GKRS was administered fractionated because of either a large volume (>14 cc) or an inability to spare neighboring organs at risk from permissible radiation in single-session GKRS. The inter-fraction interval was kept at 24 hours, and the dose calculation was performed with linear quadratic equations. Patients with more than 3 years of clinical and radiological follow-up were included in prospective analysis. At pre-decided follow-up criteria, treatment effects and side effects were documented on objective scales. RESULTS: A total of 169/202 patients met inclusion criteria. 41% patients received treatment in three fractions, whereas 59% received two-fraction GKRS. Two patients of giant cavernous sinus hemangiomas were treated with 5 Gy in the five-fraction regimen. In patients with more than 3 years of follow-up, the obliteration rate was 88% for complex arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) treated with hfGKRS because of eloquent locations, whereas it was 62% for Spetzler-Martin grade 4-5 AVMs. For non-AVM pathologies (meningiomas, schwannomas, pituitary adenomas, paragangliomas, hypothalamic hamartomas, etc.), the 5-year progression free survival was 95%. Tumor failure was noted in 0.05% patient population. Radiation necrosis developed in 8.1% patients, and radiation-induced brain edema developed in 12% patients. It was resistant to treatment in 4% patients. No patient developed radiation-induced malignancy. Hypo-fractionation did not provide any hearing improvement in giant vestibular schwannomas. CONCLUSION: hfGKRS is a valuable standalone treatment option for candidates unsuitable for single-session GKRS. The dosing parameters need to be tailored as per the pathology and neighboring structures. It provides comparable results to single-session GKRS with an acceptable safety and complication profile.",2023 Mar-Apr,2023,Neurology India,71,Supplement,S189-S197,eng,False,10.4103/0028-3886.373638;ni_2023_71_7_189_373638;10.4103/0028-3886.373638,Journal Article,Humans;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects/methods;Feasibility Studies;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery;Treatment Outcome;*Meningeal Neoplasms/surgery;Follow-Up Studies;Retrospective Studies,Complication;complications;dose fractionation;gamma knife radiosurgery;hypo-fractionation;necrosis;tumor;vascular malformation
39213826,Unforeseen outcomes: Unveiling cyst formation post stereotactic radiosurgery in brain arteriovenous malformations cases.,"INTRODUCTION: Cyst formation after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is a rare, delayed but important complication. Prompt recognition and appropriate treatment is essential for good outcome. METHODS: We analysed our institute's Gamma knife treatment records from 2008 to 2023 and analysed AVM treated patients by gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS). Patients with cyst formation and with adequate follow up were identified. Clinical details, management and prognosis of these patients was studied in detail along with prior literature review. RESULTS: A total of 921 AVM patients were treated in the above period and 7 patients were identified with cyst formation. The mean nidus volume was 12.98 ml, the mean radio surgical marginal dose was 23.57 Gy and maximal dose 47.21 Gy. The mean interval gap between SRS and cyst detection was 6.45 years. The mean volume of cyst cavity formed was 47.85 ml. Patients presented either with features of raised intracranial pressure (3) or focal neurological deficits (3) or seizures (1). 3 patients had achieved angiographic nidus obliteration at the time of cyst detection. Treatment was mostly on surgical lines with cyst fenestration(2 patients), excision (3 patients) and emergency decompressive craniectomy (1 patient). 1 patient required additional Ommaya insertion. Conservative management was followed for 1 patient. Residual nidus was treated either by concomitant excision or embolization or redo GKRS. Favourable outcome was seen in 6 out of 7 patients (85.71%) post cyst management with symptomatic and radiological improvement whereas 1 patient (14.28%) died due to refractory status epilepticus secondary to malignant cerebral edema. CONCLUSION: Cyst formation after GKRS for AVM treatment is an often-neglected complication due to its low incidence and often long latency period. Long term follow up of patients is hence necessary for prompt recognition. Diagnostic DSA should be done in all patients with cysts to look for residual nidus. Asymptomatic ones can be followed up conservatively while surgical treatment is required for symptomatic cases. Ventricular diversion like Ommaya or cystoperitoneal shunt may be necessary in some cases. Treatment outcome is usually favourable provided timely detection is done.",2024 Oct,2024,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society,128,,110785,eng,False,S0967-5868(24)00324-2;10.1016/j.jocn.2024.110785;S0967-5868(24)00324-2;10.1016/j.jocn.2024.110785,Journal Article,Humans;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects/methods;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery/complications;Male;Female;Adult;*Cysts/etiology;Middle Aged;Postoperative Complications/etiology;Young Adult;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;Adolescent,AVM;Cyst;Gamma knife;Intracranial
34450589,Adverse radiation effects in volume-staged radiosurgery for large arteriovenous malformations: a multiinstitutional study.,"OBJECTIVE: The optimal treatment paradigm for large arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is controversial. One approach is volume-staged stereotactic radiosurgery (VS-SRS). The authors previously reported efficacy of VS-SRS for large AVMs in a multiinstitutional cohort; here they focus on risk of symptomatic adverse radiation effects (AREs). METHODS: This is a multicentered retrospective review of patients treated with a planned prospective volume staging approach to stereotactically treat the entire nidus of an AVM, with volume stages separated by intervals of 3-6 months. A total of 9 radiosurgical centers treated 257 patients with VS-SRS between 1991 and 2016. The authors evaluated permanent, transient, and total ARE events that were symptomatic. RESULTS: Patients received 2-4 total volume stages. The median age was 33 years at the time of the first SRS volume stage, and the median follow-up was 5.7 years after VS-SRS. The median total AVM nidus volume was 23.25 cm3 (range 7.7-94.4 cm3), with a median margin dose per stage of 17 Gy (range 12-20 Gy). A total of 64 patients (25%) experienced an ARE, of which 19 were permanent. Rather than volume, maximal linear dimension in the Z (craniocaudal) dimension was associated with toxicity; a threshold length of 3.28 cm was associated with an ARE, with a 72.5% sensitivity and a 58.3% specificity. In addition, parietal lobe involvement for superficial lesions and temporal lobe involvement for deep lesions were associated with an ARE. CONCLUSIONS: Size remains the dominant predictor of toxicity following SRS, but overall rates of AREs were lower than anticipated based on baseline features, suggesting that dose and size were relatively dissociated through volume staging. Further techniques need to be assessed to optimize outcomes.",2022 Feb 1,2022,Journal of neurosurgery,136,2,503-511,eng,False,10.3171/2020.12.JNS201866;10.3171/2020.12.JNS201866,Journal Article;Multicenter Study,Adult;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/radiotherapy/surgery;Prospective Studies;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects/methods;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome,arteriovenous malformation;stereotactic radiosurgery;toxicity;vascular disorders;volume-staged SRS

To date, there have been no prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trials to determine the optimal method of treatment of brain AVMs. However, multiple retrospective analyses of treatment strategies and surgical results in patients with brain AVMs reveal that the management of brain AVMs requires a multimodal, multidisciplinary treatment approach, utilizing surgical resection, endovascular embolization, and/or stereotactic focused-beam radiosurgery.",2002 Jan,2002,Current neurology and neuroscience reports,2,1,44-9,eng,False,10.1007/s11910-002-0052-z,Journal Article;Review,"Embolization, Therapeutic;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/physiopathology/*therapy;Neurosurgical Procedures;Prognosis;Radiosurgery;Stereotaxic Techniques",
38104931,Natural History and Histopathology of Expanding Cysts and Hematomas After Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Arteriovenous Malformations of the Brain: A Case Series.,"BACKGROUND: We reviewed the clinical course and histopathologic findings for cases involving the formation of expanding cysts and/or hematomas after gamma knife surgery (GKS) for arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). METHODS: We report a single-center retrospective review of 18 patients who presented with cyst and/or hematoma expansion after GKS for AVMs between 1993 and 2023. Expanding cysts and hematomas were defined as well-demarcated cavities filled with fluid or well-marginated heterogenous hematomas presenting with expansion proximal to or in the location of the original AVM, respectively. Patient demographics, AVM characteristics, history of interventions and surgeries, and imaging and histopathologic features of expanding cysts and hematomas were collected for analysis. RESULTS: Among 1072 AVM patients treated using GKS, 18 presented with expanding cysts or hematomas during a total follow-up period of 16,757 patient-years (0.11 case/100 persons/patient-year). The time to cyst or hematoma identification was 4-13 years after initial GKS, with a mean duration of 8.6 years. Among the patients examined, 7 (38.9%) presented mainly with hematoma, 10 (55.6%) presented mainly with cysts, and 1 presented with approximately equal components of both. Among the 18 patients, 13 (72.2%) underwent craniotomy to treat cyst or hematoma expansion. All the specimens had similar histopathologic characteristics, including organizing hematoma with fresh and old hemorrhage, fibrinoid necrosis of the vessels, gliosis of normal brain tissue, infiltration of hemosiderin-laden histiocytes, and extravascular protein leakage.

24605839,Radiosurgery for low-grade intracranial arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECT: Low-grade, or Spetzler-Martin (SM) Grades I and II, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are associated with lower surgical morbidity rates than higher-grade lesions. While radiosurgery is now widely accepted as an effective treatment approach for AVMs, the risks and benefits of the procedure for low-grade AVMs, as compared with microsurgery, remain poorly understood. The authors of this study present the outcomes for a large cohort of low-grade AVMs treated with radiosurgery. METHODS: From an institutional radiosurgery database comprising approximately 1450 AVM cases, all patients with SM Grade I and II lesions were identified. Patients with less than 2 years of radiological follow-up, except those with complete AVM obliteration, were excluded from analysis. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional-hazards and logistic regression analyses were used to determine factors associated with obliteration, radiation-induced changes (RICs), and hemorrhage following radiosurgery. RESULTS: Five hundred two patients harboring low-grade AVMs were eligible for analysis. The median age was 35 years, 50% of patients were male, and the most common presentation was hemorrhage (47%). The median AVM volume and prescription dose were 2.4 cm(3) and 23 Gy, respectively. The median radiological and clinical follow-up intervals were 48 and 62 months, respectively. The cumulative obliteration rate was 76%. The median time to obliteration was 40 months, and the actuarial obliteration rates were 66% and 80% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. Independent predictors of obliteration were no preradiosurgery embolization (p < 0.001), decreased AVM volume (p = 0.005), single draining vein (p = 0.013), lower radiosurgery-based AVM scale score (p = 0.016), and lower Virginia Radiosurgery AVM Scale (Virginia RAS) score (p = 0.001). The annual postradiosurgery hemorrhage rate was 1.4% with increased AVM volume (p = 0.034) and lower prescription dose (p = 0.006) as independent predictors. Symptomatic and permanent RICs were observed in 8.2% and 1.4% of patients, respectively. No preradiosurgery hemorrhage (p = 0.011), a decreased prescription dose (p = 0.038), and a higher Virginia RAS score (p = 0.001) were independently associated with postradiosurgery RICs. CONCLUSIONS: Spetzler-Martin Grade I and II AVMs are very amenable to successful treatment with stereotactic radiosurgery.

36087316,Surgical treatment of brain arteriovenous malformations: clinical outcomes of patients included in the registry of a pragmatic randomized trial.,"OBJECTIVE: The Treatment of Brain Arteriovenous Malformations Study (TOBAS) is a pragmatic study that includes 2 randomized trials and registries of treated or conservatively managed patients. The authors report the results of the surgical registry. METHODS: TOBAS patients are managed according to an algorithm that combines clinical judgment and randomized allocation. For patients considered for curative treatment, clinicians selected from surgery, endovascular therapy, or radiation therapy as the primary curative method, and whether observation was a reasonable alternative. When surgery was selected and observation was deemed unreasonable, the patient was not included in the randomized controlled trial but placed in the surgical registry. The primary outcome of the trial was mRS score > 2 at 10 years (at last follow-up for the current report). Secondary outcomes include angiographic results, perioperative serious adverse events, and permanent treatment-related complications leading to mRS score > 2. RESULTS: From June 2014 to May 2021, 1010 patients were recruited at 30 TOBAS centers. Surgery was selected for 229/512 patients (44%) considered for curative treatment; 77 (34%) were included in the surgery versus observation randomized trial and 152 (66%) were placed in the surgical registry. Surgical registry patients had 124/152 (82%) ruptured and 28/152 (18%) unruptured arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), with the majority categorized as low-grade Spetzler-Martin grade I-II AVM (118/152 [78%]). Thirteen patients were excluded, leaving 139 patients for analysis. Embolization was performed prior to surgery in 78/139 (56%) patients. Surgical angiographic cure was obtained in 123/139 all-grade (89%, 95% CI 82%-93%) and 105/110 low-grade (95%, 95% CI 90%-98%) AVM patients. At the mean follow-up of 18.1 months, 16 patients (12%, 95% CI 7%-18%) had reached the primary safety outcome of mRS score > 2, including 11/16 who had a baseline mRS score ≥ 3 due to previous AVM rupture. Serious adverse events occurred in 29 patients (21%, 95% CI 15%-28%). Permanent treatment-related complications leading to mRS score > 2 occurred in 6/139 patients (4%, 95% CI 2%-9%), 5 (83%) of whom had complications due to preoperative embolization. CONCLUSIONS: The surgical treatment of brain AVMs in the TOBAS registry was curative in 88% of patients. The participation of more patients, surgeons, and centers in randomized trials is needed to definitively establish the role of surgery in the treatment of unruptured brain AVMs. Clinical trial registration no.: NCT02098252 (ClinicalTrials.gov).",2023 Apr 1,2023,Journal of neurosurgery,138,4,891-899,eng,False,10.3171/2022.7.JNS22813;10.3171/2022.7.JNS22813,Journal Article;Randomized Controlled Trial,"Humans;Treatment Outcome;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/surgery;Prospective Studies;*Embolization, Therapeutic/methods;Registries;*Radiosurgery/methods;Brain;Retrospective Studies",brain arteriovenous malformation;care trial;randomized trial;ruptured AVM;surgical treatment registry;unruptured AVM;vascular disorders

OBJECTIVE: To analyze in a multicenter, retrospective cohort study, the outcomes following radiosurgery for unruptured AVMs and determine predictive factors. METHODS: We evaluated and pooled AVM radiosurgery data from 8 institutions participating in the International Gamma Knife Research Foundation. Patients with unruptured AVMs and ≥12 mo of follow-up were included in the study cohort. Favorable outcome was defined as AVM obliteration, no postradiosurgical hemorrhage, and no permanently symptomatic radiation-induced changes. RESULTS: The unruptured AVM cohort comprised 938 patients with a median age of 35 yr. The median nidus volume was 2.4 cm 3 , 71% of AVMs were located in eloquent brain areas, and the Spetzler-Martin grade was III or higher in 57%. The median radiosurgical margin dose was 21 Gy and follow-up was 71 mo. AVM obliteration was achieved in 65%. The annual postradiosurgery hemorrhage rate was 1.4%. Symptomatic and permanent radiation-induced changes occurred in 9% and 3%, respectively. Favorable outcome was achieved in 61%. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, smaller AVM maximum diameter ( P = .001), the absence of AVM-associated arterial aneurysms ( P = .001), and higher margin dose ( P = .002) were found to be independent predictors of a favorable outcome. A margin dose ≥ 20 Gy yielded a significantly higher rate of favorable outcome (70% vs 36%; P < .001).

12738330,Repeat linear accelerator radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate repeat radiosurgery (RS2) for cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) after failure of initial radiosurgery (RS1). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1986 and 2000, 41 patients underwent RS2. Nine patients were not assessable: seven had insufficient follow-up (RS2 in 1999 and 2000) and two had no recent control angiography data. Thus, 32 (78%) of 41 patients were assessed. Most lesions (29 [90%] of 32) were supratentorial: 22 (69%) on the left, 8 (25%) on the right, and 2 on the midline (6%). The patients had Spetzler-Martin Grade 1-5 (median Grade 3). The symptoms before RS1 included hemorrhage in 20 (63%), epilepsy in 10 (31%), progressive neurologic deficits in 2 (6%), and headaches in 6 (19%). Five patients had two or more symptoms. Twenty-two patients (69%) had received other treatment before RS1, including neurosurgery in 3 patients (9%) and one to six embolizations in 19 patients. At RS1, the median largest nidus dimension was 2.7 cm (range 0.8-5). The median volume was 2.7 cm(3) (range 1.2-9.9). The median time from RS1 to RS2 was 52 months (range 12-126). Between RS1 and RS2, 7 (22%) of 32 patients experienced bleeding. The same irradiation technique was used for RS1 and RS2, except for 2 patients who underwent RS2 at another institution. Circular 15-MV X-ray minibeams (range 6-20 mm) and coronal arcs were used. RS1 was monoisocentric in 75% of cases and multiisocentric in 25%. At RS2, the median largest nidus dimension was 3 cm (range 1.4-5). The median volume was 4.2 cm(3) (range 0.8-13.4). RS2 was monocentric in 72% of cases and multiisocentric in 28%. After RS2, the median follow-up was 19.5 months (range 0-79; mean 25.3). RESULTS: After RS2, the obliteration rate was 59.3% (19 of 32). The median time to arteriographic obliteration was 21 months (range 12-96). The survival rate was 97% (31 of 32). Five of the 13 patients with a nonobliterated nidus experienced complications; 3 had bleeding (9%) and 2 without prior neurologic deficits developed partially regressive neurologic deficits. One patient with a previously existing deficit developed an additional new partially regressive neurologic deficit after an episode of bleeding. Thus, 3 (9%) of 32 patients had neurologic complications. Moderate-grade parenchymal changes at MRI increased after RS2 (88.2% vs. 57.7% after RS1; p = 0.10, not significant). However, necrosis-like changes did not significantly increase. After RS1 failure, salvage may be attempted by embolization, neurosurgery, or RS2.

29762746,Microsurgery Versus Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Brain Arteriovenous Malformations: A Matched Cohort Study.,"BACKGROUND: Microsurgery (MS) and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) remain the preferred interventions for the curative treatment of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVM), but their relative efficacy remains incompletely defined. OBJECTIVE: To compare the outcomes of MS to SRS for AVMs through a retrospective, matched cohort study. METHODS: We evaluated institutional databases of AVM patients who underwent MS and SRS. MS-treated patients were matched, in a 1:1 ratio based on patient and AVM characteristics, to SRS-treated patients. Statistical analyses were performed to compare outcomes data between the 2 cohorts. The primary outcome was defined as AVM obliteration without a new permanent neurological deficit. RESULTS: The matched MS and SRS cohorts were each comprised of 59 patients. Both radiological (85 vs 11 mo; P < .001) and clinical (92 vs 12 mo; P < .001) follow-up were significantly longer for the SRS cohort. The primary outcome was achieved in 69% of each cohort. The MS cohort had a significantly higher obliteration rate (98% vs 72%; P = .001), but also had a significantly higher rate of new permanent deficit (31% vs 10%; P = .011). The posttreatment hemorrhage rate was significantly higher for the SRS cohort (10% for SRS vs 0% for MS; P = .027). In subgroup analyses of ruptured and unruptured AVMs, no significant differences between the primary outcomes were observed. CONCLUSION: For patients with comparable AVMs, MS and SRS afford similar rates of deficit-free obliteration. Nidal obliteration is more frequently achieved with MS, but this intervention also incurs a greater risk of new permanent neurological deficit.",2019 Mar 1,2019,Neurosurgery,84,3,696-708,eng,True,10.1093/neuros/nyy174;4995534;10.1093/neuros/nyy174,Comparative Study;Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Cohort Studies;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;Microsurgery/*methods;Middle Aged;Neurosurgical Procedures/*methods;Radiosurgery/*methods;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome,Gamma knife;Intracranial arteriovenous malformation;Intracranial hemorrhages;Microsurgery;Radiosurgery;Stroke;Vascular malformations

We graded the quality of the evidence. Recommendations were arrived at through a consensus conference of the authors, then with additional input from the full Society of NeuroInterventional Surgery (SNIS) Standards and Guidelines Committee and the SNIS Board of Directors. RESULTS: The multidisciplinary evaluation and treatment of brain AVMs continues to evolve. Recommendations include: (1) Digital subtraction catheter cerebral angiography (DSA)-including 2D, 3D, and reformatted cross-sectional views when appropriate-is recommended in the pre-treatment assessment of cerebral AVMs. (I, B-NR) . (2) It is recommended that endovascular embolization of cerebral arteriovenous malformations be performed in the context of a complete multidisciplinary treatment plan aiming for obliteration of the AVM and cure. (I, B-NR) . (3) Embolization of brain AVMs before surgical resection can be useful to reduce intraoperative blood loss, morbidity, and surgical complexity. (IIa, B-NR) . (4) The role of primary curative embolization of cerebral arteriovenous malformations is uncertain, particularly as compared with microsurgery and radiosurgery with or without adjunctive embolization. Further research is needed, particularly with regard to risk for AVM recurrence. (III equivocal, C-LD) . (5) Targeted embolization of high-risk features of ruptured brain AVMs may be considered to reduce the risk for recurrent hemorrhage. (IIb, C-LD) . (6) Palliative embolization may be useful to treat symptomatic AVMs in which curative therapy is otherwise not possible. (IIb, B-NR) . (7) The role of AVM embolization as an adjunct to radiosurgery is not well-established. Further research is needed. (III equivocal, C-LD) . (8) Imaging follow-up after apparent cure of brain AVMs is recommended to assess for recurrence. Although non-invasive imaging may be used for longitudinal follow-up, DSA remains the gold standard for residual or recurrent AVM detection in patients with concerning imaging and/or clinical findings. (I, C-LD) . (9) Improved national and international reporting of patients of all ages with brain AVMs, their treatments, side effects from treatment, and their long-term outcomes would enhance the ability to perform clinical trials and improve the rigor of research into this rare condition.

25624979,The role of microsurgical resection and radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) present unique challenges to cerebrovascular specialists. Management of these lesions begins with assessing their natural history. Intervention with the goal of complete obliteration requires some component of microsurgical techniques or radiosurgery. Clinicians must weigh observation and acceptance of the natural history of these lesions versus intervention on a case-by-case basis. Microsurgical resection and radiosurgery are both well-validated tools used in selectively treating cerebral AVMs. This manuscript offers a general review of the management of cerebral AVMs with multimodality treatment recommendations.,2014 Oct-Dec,2014,Methodist DeBakey cardiovascular journal,10,4,240-4,eng,False,10.14797/mdcj-10-4-240;10.14797/mdcj-10-4-240,Journal Article;Review,"Embolization, Therapeutic;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Microsurgery/*methods;Radiosurgery/*methods",arteriovenous malformation;embolization;microsurgical resection;radiosurgery
36964736,Outcome of 107 conservatively managed unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations: a single center's 30-year experience.,"OBJECTIVE: Since the publication of A Randomized Trial of Unruptured Brain AVMs (ARUBA), the management of unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) has been controversially discussed. Long-term follow-up data on the exclusively conservative management of unruptured bAVMs are scarce. The authors evaluated the long-term outcomes of patients with unruptured untreated bAVMs in a real-life cohort. METHODS: A retrospective observational cohort of 107 patients (of 897 bAVM patients referred to the authors' institution) with a diagnosis of unruptured and conservatively managed bAVMs is presented. AVMs of all Spetzler-Martin grades were observed. The mean follow-up period was 84 months. In 44% of patients, a follow-up period of 5 years or longer was observed. A national death register comparison completed the outcome analysis. RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis, sex distribution, neurological presentation, and modified Rankin Scale score were comparable to the patients in the medical management arm of the ARUBA study. Patients were mainly young, predominantly male, and in good clinical condition. Similar to the ARUBA cohort, 77% of this study's cohort presented in an excellent clinical status at the time of last follow-up. However, 17% of patients had at least one hemorrhage, resulting in an overall annual hemorrhage risk of 2.7% in the observation period. Moreover, the cumulative 1-, 5-, and 10-year overall hemorrhage rates were 3.0%, 11.3%, and 15.3%, respectively. Consequently, the long-term follow-up AVM-related mortality rate amounted to 8%. The estimated median overall survival after AVM diagnosis was 19.3 years (95% CI 14.0-24.6 years). A multivariate Cox regression model revealed temporal and deep-seated localization as an independent risk factor for AVM hemorrhage, while the presence of seizures reached borderline significance as a risk factor. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' results represent the long-term course of unruptured untreated bAVMs. Their data support the conclusion that even in the post-ARUBA era, tailored active treatment options may be offered to patients with unruptured bAVMs. For patient counseling, individual risk factors should be weighed against the center's treatment-specific risks.",2023 Oct 1,2023,Journal of neurosurgery,139,4,1025-1035,eng,False,10.3171/2023.2.JNS222675;10.3171/2023.2.JNS222675,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Humans;Male;Female;Treatment Outcome;Retrospective Studies;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery;Risk Factors;*Radiosurgery/methods;Brain,conservative management;hemorrhage risk;unruptured brain arteriovenous malformation;vascular disorders
25514868,Radiosurgery for unruptured cerebral arteriovenous malformations in pediatric patients.,"BACKGROUND: Unruptured cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in pediatric patients (age <18 years) were excluded from A Randomized Trial of Unruptured AVMs (ARUBA). Therefore, the efficacy of radiosurgery for unruptured pediatric AVMs is poorly understood. The goal of this study is to determine the outcomes and define the predictors of obliteration following radiosurgery for unruptured AVMs in pediatric patients. METHODS: We evaluated a prospective database, from 1989 to 2013, of AVM patients treated with radiosurgery at our institution. Patients with age less than 18 years at the time of radiosurgery, unruptured nidi, and at least 2 years of radiologic follow-up or AVM obliteration were selected for analysis. Statistical analyses were performed to determine actuarial obliteration rates and identify factors associated with obliteration. RESULTS: In the 51 unruptured pediatric AVM patients included for analysis, the median age was 13 years, and the most common presentation was seizure in 53 %. The median nidus volume and radiosurgical margin dose were 3.2 cm(3) and 21.5 Gy, respectively. The median radiologic follow-up was 45 months. The actuarial AVM obliteration rates at 3, 5, and 10 years were 29 %, 54 %, and 72 %, respectively. In the multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, higher margin dose (P = 0.002), fewer draining veins (P = 0.038), and lower Virginia Radiosurgery AVM Scale (P = 0.003) were independent predictors of obliteration. Obliteration rates were significantly higher with a margin dose of at least 22 Gy (P = 0.003) and for nidi with 2 or fewer draining veins (P = 0.001). The incidences of radiologically evident, symptomatic, and permanent radiation-induced changes were 55 %, 16 %, and 2 %, respectively. The annual post-radiosurgery hemorrhage rate was 1.3 %, and the incidence of post-radiosurgery cyst formation was 2 %.

18421250,"A comprehensive review of radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations: outcomes, predictive factors, and grading scales.","The management of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) continues to present a challenge to neurosurgeons. The natural history of this condition, as well as the morbidity and mortality of therapeutic interventions, remains incompletely elucidated. Predictive factors and grading scales in AVM management allow risk-benefit analysis of treatment options and comparison of outcomes. Stereotactic radiosurgery is one of the established treatment modalities for AVMs and is generally used to treat lesions that are high risk for surgical resection. Radiosurgery aims to obliterate AVMs and thus prevent hemorrhage or seizure without any new or worsening of existing symptoms. Lesion characteristics and postsurgical complications differ markedly in patientstreated by radiosurgery versus microsurgery. Radiosurgery-based grading systems account for factors that have been associated with various aspects of radiosurgical outcomes including obliteration, hemorrhage, and postoperative complications, particularly those induced by radiation.

28548596,Cyst formation after stereotactic radiosurgery for brain arteriovenous malformations: a systematic review.,"OBJECTIVE Cyst formation can occasionally occur after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Given the limited data regarding post-SRS cyst formation in patients with AVM, the time course, natural history, and management of this delayed complication are poorly defined. The aim of this systematic review was to determine the incidence, time course, and optimal management of cyst formation after SRS for AVMs. METHODS A literature review was performed using PubMed to identify studies reporting cyst formation in AVM patients treated with SRS. Baseline and outcomes data, including the incidence and management of post-SRS cysts, were extracted from each study that reported follow-up duration. The mean time to cyst formation was calculated from the subset of studies that reported individual patient data. RESULTS Based on pooled data from 22 studies comprising the incidence analysis, the overall rate of post-SRS cyst formation was 3.0% (78/2619 patients). Among the 26 post-SRS cyst patients with available AVM obliteration data, nidal obliteration was achieved in 20 (76.9%). Of the 64 cyst patients with available symptomatology and management data, 21 (32.8%) were symptomatic; 21 cysts (32.8%) were treated with surgical intervention, whereas the remaining 43 (67.2%) were managed conservatively. Based on a subset of 19 studies reporting individual time-to-cyst-formation data from 63 patients, the mean latency period to post-SRS cyst formation was 78 months (6.5 years). CONCLUSIONS Cyst formation is an uncommon complication after SRS for AVMs, with a relatively long latency period. The majority of post-SRS cysts are asymptomatic and can be managed conservatively, although enlarging or symptomatic cysts may require surgical intervention. Long-term follow-up of AVM patients is crucial to the appropriate diagnosis and management of post-SRS cysts.",2018 May,2018,Journal of neurosurgery,128,5,1354-1363,eng,False,2016.12.JNS162478;10.3171/2016.12.JNS162478;2016.12.JNS162478;10.3171/2016.12.JNS162478,Journal Article;Systematic Review,Brain Diseases/epidemiology/*etiology/therapy;Cysts/epidemiology/*etiology/therapy;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/epidemiology/*radiotherapy;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects,AVM = arteriovenous malformation;GKRS = Gamma Knife radiosurgery;LINAC = linear accelerator;RIC = radiation-induced change;SRS = stereotactic radiosurgery;arteriovenous malformation;complication;cyst;incidence;stereotactic radiosurgery
36681954,Retiform endothelial hyperplasia mimicking cavernous malformation as a late complication of Gamma Knife radiosurgery.,"OBJECTIVE: Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) is a powerful tool for the management of arteriovenous malformations; however, newly formed mass lesions resembling cavernous malformations are a rare late complication of GKRS. In this retrospective study, the authors tried to clarify the unique histological features of these mass lesions. METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed the clinical course of 889 patients who had undergone GKRS for arteriovenous malformations at their institute from 1991 to 2021. Among the 848 patients who had been followed up periodically with neuroradiological imaging, 37 developed a mass lesion mimicking a cavernous malformation and underwent surgical removal of the lesion. The median volume of the original nidus was 3.7 cm3 (range 0.07-30.5 cm3), and the median prescription dose was 21 Gy (range 12-25 Gy). The histological characteristics and radiological and clinical features of the 37 patients were investigated. RESULTS: Histological examination showed an organized hematoma and a structure termed ""retiform endothelial hyperplasia"" (RFEH) consisting of endothelium forming multiple lumen-like vascular channels mimicking cavernous malformations but lacking the subendothelial connective tissue that forms the typical vascular wall structure found in cavernous angioma and capillary telangiectasia. RFEH was detected a median of 10.8 years (range 3.2-27.4 years) after GKRS. Neuroimaging showed hematoma surrounded by massive brain edema in all 37 patients. Symptoms caused by mass effect of the lesion and perifocal edema worsened relatively rapidly but completely disappeared after surgery. No recurrence or morbidity occurred after the surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The delayed formation of RFEH that is mimicking a cavernous malformation neuroradiologically but is histologically distinct from a vascular malformation is a potential complication of GKRS. Its progressive clinical course suggests that surgical removal should be considered for symptomatic patients and/or patients with an apparent radiological mass sign.",2023 Jul 1,2023,Journal of neurosurgery,139,1,165-175,eng,False,10.3171/2022.11.JNS221535;10.3171/2022.11.JNS221535,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Humans;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects/methods;Treatment Outcome;Follow-Up Studies;Retrospective Studies;Hyperplasia;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/surgery;Hematoma/surgery;Disease Progression,Gamma Knife radiosurgery;arteriovenous malformation;cavernous malformation;radiation-induced;retiform endothelial hyperplasia;stereotactic radiosurgery;vascular disorders
31874295,Patterns of Failure After Linear Accelerator Radiosurgery for Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformations.,"BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have assessed the predictive factors for the arteriovenous malformation (AVM) response to stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). However, only a few have discussed the causes of failure. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the patterns of failure in patients with AVM who had undergone linear accelerator SRS. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 288 patients who had undergone linear accelerator SRS in our institution from 1995 to 2011. Failure was defined from the findings of the follow-up angiogram at 5 years, with failure identified in 44 patients. The distribution of causes was estimated using a descriptive analysis of literature-based causes, including a minimal margin dose of <18 Gy, a residual nidus outside the initial targeted volume, previous embolization, recanalization, and the size of the target volume. We also analyzed the associations among the causes. RESULTS: Incomplete nidus identification (41%) and previous embolization (77%) were the most frequently observed conditions in patients with failure. Patients who had undergone previous embolization, for whom the cause of failure had always been identified (P = 0.001), were younger (P = 0.004) and had had a larger nidus volume (P = 0.025). Recanalization was rare (5 of 34 patients) and had occurred exclusively in women (P = 0.048). Larger nidus volumes were less frequent (mean, 2.18 ± 2.2 cm(3); range, 0.13-10.8 cm(3)) and had been observed mainly in women when >2 cm(3) (P = 0.012). An insufficient dose was observed in 9 patients and had occurred in the case of a larger volume (P = 0.031), which had resulted in dosimetry constraints in 3 patients and treatment in the vicinity of eloquent zones in 6 patients. No known cause was found in 5 patients, 4 of whom had had a low Spetzler-Martin grade (I and II; P = 0.003), suggestive of radioresistance.

32385636,Clinical outcome following cerebral AVM hemorrhage.,"BACKGROUND: A significant difference exists between the published results reporting the clinical outcome following brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM) ruptures. Information about the outcome following hemorrhage in an AVM population treated with radiosurgery could provide additional information to assess the risk of mortality and morbidity following an AVM hemorrhage. METHODS: Clinical outcome was studied in 383 patients, the largest patient population yet studied, who suffered from a symptomatic hemorrhage after Gamma Knife® surgery (GKS) but before confirmed AVM obliteration. The impact of different patient, AVM, and treatment parameters on the clinical outcome was analyzed. The aim was to generate outcome predictions by comparing our data to and combining them with earlier published results. RESULTS: No relation was found between clinical outcome and treatment parameters, indicating that the results are applicable also on untreated AVMs. Twenty-one percent of the patients died, 45% developed or experienced worsening of neurological sequelae, and 35% recovered completely after the hemorrhage. Old age was a predictor of poor outcome. Sex, AVM location, AVM volume, and history of prior hemorrhage did not influence the outcome. The mortality rate was comparable to earlier published prospective data, but higher than that found in retrospective studies. CONCLUSIONS: The mortality rates in earlier published retrospective series as well as in studies focusing on clinical outcome following AVM hemorrhage significantly underestimate the risk for a mortal outcome following an AVM hemorrhage. Based on our findings, an AVM rupture has around 20% likelihood to result in mortality, 45% likelihood to result in a minor or major deficit, and 35% likelihood of complete recovery. The findings are probably applicable also for AVM ruptures in general.

30191363,Functional and educational outcomes after treatment for intracranial arteriovenous malformations in children.,"BACKGROUND: Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in the pediatric population are rare, yet they form the most frequent cause of hemorrhagic stroke in children. Compared to adults, children have been suggested to have beneficial neurological outcomes. However, few studies have focused on other variables than neurological outcomes. This study aims to assess the long-term functional and educational outcomes of children after multimodality approach of treatment for intracranial AVMs. METHODS: All children treated in our center between 1998 and 2016 for intracranial AVMs were reviewed. Patient characteristics, as well as AVM specifics, were collected. Functional outcomes were compared using the modified Rankin scale (mRs). Educational levels, using the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED), were compared to the age-matched general population of the Netherlands. RESULTS: In total, 25 children were included at mean age of 10 years (range 2-16 years). Nineteen patients (76%) presented with intracranial bleeding. Mean follow-up was 11.5 ± 5.3 years (range 4.1-24.4). Four (16%) of patients were treated with embolization, three (12%) with microsurgery, and 18 patients (72%) received a combination of different treatment modalities. Altogether, 21 (84%) were embolized, 14 (56%) were treated with microsurgery, and eight (32%) received stereotactic radiosurgery. One child had a worse mRs at discharge compared to admission; all others improved (n = 11) or were stable (n = 13). At follow-up, all patients scored a stable or improved mRs compared to discharge, with 23 children (92%) scoring mRs 0 or 1. These 23 children followed regular education during follow-up without specialized or adapted schooling. No significant differences in educational level with the age-matched general population were found.

32234990,Arteriovenous malformation presenting with epilepsy: a multimodal approach to diagnosis and treatment.,"Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) presenting with epilepsy significantly impacts patient quality of life, and it should be considered very much a seizure disorder. Although hemorrhage prevention is the primary treatment aim of AVM surgery, seizure control should also be at the forefront of therapeutic management. Several hemodynamic and morphological characteristics of AVM have been identified to be associated with seizure presentation. This includes increased AVM flow, presence of long pial draining vein, venous outflow obstruction, and frontotemporal location, among other aspects. With the advent of high-throughput image processing and quantification methods, new radiographic attributes of AVM-related epilepsy have been identified. With respect to therapy, several treatment approaches are available, including conservative management or interventional modalities; this includes microsurgery, radiosurgery, and embolization or a combination thereof. Many studies, especially in the domain of microsurgery and radiosurgery, evaluate both techniques with respect to seizure outcomes. The advantage of microsurgery lies in superior AVM obliteration rates and swift seizure response. In addition, by incorporating electrophysiological monitoring during AVM resection, adjacent or even remote epileptogenic foci can be identified, leading to extended lesionectomy and improved seizure control. Radiosurgery, despite resulting in reduced AVM obliteration and prolonged time to seizure freedom, avoids the risks of surgery altogether and may provide seizure control through various antiepileptic mechanisms.

35870722,Assessment of gamma knife radiosurgery for unruptured cerebral arterioveneus malformations based on multi-parameter radiomics of MRI.,"OBJECTIVE: The treatment of Gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS) for unruptured Arteriovenous Malformations (AVM) remains controversial. A safe, effective and non-invasive method to predict outcome seems attractive for GKS. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a MRI based multi-parameter radiomics model predicting the outcome of GKS for unruptured AVM. METHODS: Eighty-eight unruptured AVM patients who initial underwent GKS between January 2011 and December 2016 in our hospital were included in this retrospective study. Patients were divided into two groups named as favourable and unfavourable outcome, according to the clinical outcome. Favourable outcome was defined as obliteration without post-SRS hemorrhage or permanent radiation-induced changes (RIC). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to select appropriate clinical features and construct a clinical predicting model. In terms of radiomic model, manually segmentation and radiomics extracted were performed on each AVM lesions. Finally, 1684 radiomics features were extracted and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) method combined with Random forest classifier were used for feature selection and model construction. The performance of the radiomics model was evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). In addition, the favourable group was further divided into early and late respond subgroup according to the time of obliteration evaluated by 2 years. The selected features were further compared according the respond time. RESULTS: The median duration of neuroimaging follow-up was 65 months, 56 patients showed favourable outcome and 17 patients were observed obliteration within 2 years. The radiomics model constructed by 12 selected features achieved significant higher AUC of 0.88 (95% confidence interval 0.87-0.90) than traditional scoring system for predicting AVM outcome. Two selected radiomics features named ""Dependence Variance"" and ""firstorder-Skewness"" were found significant difference between the patients with early or late-respond. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the radiomics features could be successfully used for the pretreatment prediction of outcome for GKS in unruptured AVMs, which is helpful for decision-making process on unruptured AVM patients.",2022 Oct,2022,Magnetic resonance imaging,92,,251-259,eng,False,S0730-725X(22)00119-9;10.1016/j.mri.2022.07.008;S0730-725X(22)00119-9;10.1016/j.mri.2022.07.008,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Follow-Up Studies;Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/radiotherapy;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects/methods;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome,Arteriovenous malformation;Gamma knife radiosurgery;Machine learning;Radiomic;Unruptured
38857704,Sustaining consistent cobalt-60 dose rate enhances radiosurgical outcomes in brain arteriovenous malformation management.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The impact of cobalt-60 dose rate (Co-60 DR) on outcomes of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) remains fully elucidated. This study explored the association between Co-60 DR and SRS outcomes in AVM treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 772 AVM patients from 1990 to 2020 were included. High DR was defined as ≥ 2.4 Gy/min. AVM patients were categorized into 3 cohorts based on the nidus volume: small (<5 mL), medium (≥5 mL and < 10 mL), and large (≥10 mL). The primary endpoint was AVM obliteration; secondary endpoints included post-SRS hemorrhage. RESULTS: Cumulative obliteration rates of the large AVM were significantly increased in the high DR group than those in the low DR group (84 % vs. 45 % at 5 years, log-rank test; p = 0.011). Multivariable analysis showed that the obliteration rate was significantly elevated for the high DR group in the large AVM cohort with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.78 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1.00-3.17, p = 0.049). Post-SRS hemorrhage rates of the entire cohort were significantly decreased in the high DR group than in the low DR group (2.5 % vs. 5.3 % at 5 years, log-rank test; p = 0.035). Multivariable analysis revealed post-SRS hemorrhage was reduced in the high DR group with an adjusted HR of 0.47 (95 % CI: 0.24-0.92, p = 0.026). CONCLUSION: High DR may lead to increased efficiency for large AVMs and decreased post-SRS hemorrhage in all AVM cases.

29969736,Repeat Radiosurgery Treatment After Cavernous Malformation Radiosurgery.,"OBJECTIVE: Of cavernous malformations (CMs) treated with radiosurgery (RS), 5% bleed after 2-year initial latency period. This rate is similar to failure rate of RS for other pathologies, which often require repeat RS for favorable outcome. The aim of this pilot study was to define failure of CM RS and to assess safety of second RS. METHODS: Retrospective analysis was performed of 7 of 345 CMs retreated with RS; 6 CMs were deep-seated, and 1 was superficial. Median time between the 2 treatments was 8 years (range, 3-16 years), and median follow-up time after second RS was 3 years (range, 1-9 years). RESULTS: Following the 2-year latency period after RS, 6% of deep-seated and 5% of hemispheric CMs, and 6% of deep-seated and 2% of hemispheric lesions caused transient neurologic deficits without hemorrhage. A second treatment was indicated for rebleed in 5 cases and for recurrent transient neurologic deficits in 2 cases. Prescribed dose was 15 Gy (range, 12-20 Gy) at first treatment and 12 Gy (range, 12-18 Gy) at second treatment. Target volumes were 692 mm(3) (range, 54-2400 mm(3)) and 935 mm(3) (range, 150-1550 mm(3)) at first and second treatments, respectively, and treatment volumes were 811 mm(3) (range, 79-2500 mm(3)) and 962 mm(3) (range, 194-1750 mm(3)), respectively. Differences in treatment parameters were not significant. Reason for failure was inaccurate target definition in only 2 cases. There were no bleeds, morbidity, or mortality after second RS. CONCLUSIONS: Second RS applied to previously treated CMs is safe and may be effective.

26306863,Gamma Knife Radiosurgery for Pediatric Arteriovenous Malformations: A Canadian Experience.,"BACKGROUND: Gamma Knife (GK) radiosurgery for pediatric arteriovenous malformations (AVM) of the brain presents a non-invasive treatment option. We report our institutional experience with GK for pediatric AVMs. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all pediatric patients treated with GK for cerebral AVMs at our institution from November 2003 up to and including September 2014. Patient demographics, AVM characteristics, treatment parameters and AVM responses were recorded. RESULTS: Nineteen patients were treated, with 4 lost to follow-up. The mean age was 14.2 years (range. 7-18 years), with 10 being males (52.6%). The mean AVM diameter and volume were 2.68 cm and 3.10 cm3 respectively. The mean Spetzler-Martin (SM) and Pollock grades of the treated AVMs were 2.4 and 0.99 respectively. The mean follow-up was 62 months. All AVMs treated demonstrated a response on follow-up imaging. Nine of 15 (60.0%) patients displayed obliteration of their AVMs. Nine of 11 patients with a minimum of 3 years follow-up (81.8%) displayed obliteration, with SM and Pollock grades correlating to the chance of obliteration in this group.

37830840,Biologically Effective Dose and Prediction of Obliteration of Arteriovenous Malformations in Pediatric Patients Treated by Gamma Knife Radiosurgery.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) represents an effective treatment for pediatric arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Biological effective dose (BED) has shown promising results in 2 previous studies as a predictive variable for outcomes in adults, but its role has never been studied in pediatric outcomes. METHODS: Retrospective data for patients 18 years or younger treated with a single-session SRS for AVMs were collected from 1989 to 2019. BED calculations were performed using an α/β ratio of 2.47. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to evaluate obliteration, new hemorrhage, and radiation-induced changes (RIC). Cox-regression analysis was used for obliteration prediction using 2 models (margin dose vs BED). RESULTS: One hundred ninety-seven patients (median age = 13.1 years, IQR = 5.2) were included; 72.6% (143/197) of them presented initially with spontaneous hemorrhage. A median margin dose of 22 Gy (IQR = 4.0) with a median BED of 183.2 Gy (IQR = 70.54) was used to treat AVM with a median volume of 2.8 cm 3 (IQR = 2.9). After SRS, obliteration was confirmed in 115/197 patients (58.4%) using magnetic resonance imaging and angiography at a median follow-up of 2.85 years (IQR = 2.26). The cumulative obliteration probability was 43.6% (95% CI = 36.1-50.3), 60.5% (95% CI+ = 2.2-67.4), and 66.0% (95% CI = 56.0-73.7) at 3, 5, and 10 years, respectively. In Cox multivariate analysis, a BED >180 Gy (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.11, 95% CI = 1.30-3.40, P = .002) in model 1 and a margin dose >20 Gy (HR = 1.90, 95% CI = 1.15-3.13, P = .019) in model 2 were associated with obliteration. An AVM nidus volume >4 cm 3 was associated with lower obliteration rates in both models. The probability of symptomatic RIC at 10 years was 8.6% (95% CI = 3.5-13.4). Neither BED nor margin dose was associated with RIC occurrence, with the only predictive factor being deep AVM location (HR = 3, 95% CI = 1-9.1, P = .048). CONCLUSION: This study confirms BED as a predictor for pediatric AVM obliteration. Optimization of BED in pediatric AVM SRS planning may improve cumulative obliteration rates.",2024 Mar 1,2024,Neurosurgery,94,3,614-621,eng,False,10.1227/neu.0000000000002717;00006123-202403000-00022;10.1227/neu.0000000000002717,Journal Article,Adult;Humans;Child;Adolescent;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects/methods;Retrospective Studies;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/radiotherapy/surgery;Treatment Outcome;Postoperative Hemorrhage/epidemiology;Follow-Up Studies,
28362923,Volume-Staged Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations: Outcomes Based on an 18-Year Experience.,"BACKGROUND: Radiation-based treatment options of large intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVM) must balance the likelihood of obliteration with the risk of adverse radiation effects (ARE). OBJECTIVE: To analyze the efficacy and risks of volume-staged stereotactic radiosurgery (VS-SRS) for AVM. METHODS: Retrospective study of 34 AVM patients having VS-SRS between 1997 and 2012. A median of 2 stages (range, 2-4) was used to treat a median AVM volume of 22.2 cm 3 (range, 7.4-56.7). The median AVM margin dose was 16 Gy (range, 14-18); the median radiosurgery-based AVM score was 2.81 (range, 1.54-6.45). The median follow-up after VS-SRS was 8.2 years (range, 3-13.3). RESULTS: Nidus obliteration was noted in 18 patients (53%) after VS-SRS. The rate of obliteration was 14% at 3 years, 54% at 5 years, and 75% at 7 years. Six patients (18%) had 11 bleeds after VS-SRS. Two patients (6%) remained neurologically stable, 2 (6%) patients had significant deficits, and 2 patients (6%) died. The actuarial risk of a first bleed after VS-SRS was 6% at 1 year, 12% at 3 years, and 19% at 7 years. Six patients (18%) underwent repeat SRS; all achieved nidus obliteration for an overall cure rate of 71%. Two patients (6%) had a permanent ARE after VS-SRS or repeat SRS. CONCLUSION: VS-SRS permitted large volume intracranial AVM to be treated with a low rate of ARE. Further study is needed on dose escalation and decreasing the treatment volume per stage to determine if this will increase the rate of obliteration with this technique.",2017 Apr 1,2017,Neurosurgery,80,4,543-550,eng,True,10.1093/neuros/nyw107;3072726;10.1093/neuros/nyw107,Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Child;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/*methods;Retrospective Studies;Risk Factors;*Stereotaxic Techniques;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult,Arteriovenous malformation;Complication;Radiosurgery
34863440,Microsurgical resection versus stereotactic radiosurgery for low-grade intracranial arteriovenous malformations: A 27-year institutional experience.,"The role of microsurgery and radiosurgery in the management of low-grade (Spetzler-Martin grade 1 and 2) arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) remains controversial. We aimed to compare outcomes of low-grade AVMs following microsurgery and radiosurgery using a database of AVM patients presenting between 1990 and 2017. Procedure-related complications, obliteration, and functional status at last follow-up were compared between groups. Hemorrhage-free survival was compared using Kaplan-Meier analysis with subgroup analyses by rupture status on presentation. The study involved 233 patients, of which 113 and 120 were treated with microsurgery and radiosurgery, respectively. The complication rates were statistically comparable between both treatment modalities. Mean follow-up time was 5.1 ± 5.2 years. In the complete cohort, there was no significant difference in hemorrhage-free survival between microsurgery and radiosurgery (log-rank p = 0.676, Breslow p = 0.493). When excluding procedure-related hemorrhage and partial resection, hemorrhage-free survival was significantly higher in the surgically treated cohort (log-rank = 0.094, Breslow p = 0.034). The obliteration rate was significantly higher in the surgical cohort (96% vs. 57%, p < 0.001), while functional status was similar. Microsurgery may offer superior hemorrhage-free survival in the early post-treatment period and demonstrates equivalent long-term hemorrhage control and functional outcome at 5 years compared to radiosurgery with nearly complete obliteration rates. Persistent neurologic deficits following microsurgery and symptomatic cerebral edema represent important treatment risks despite low SM grading. Appropriate patient selection even when dealing with low-grade AVMs is advised, as judicious patient selection and emphasis on technical success can minimize procedure-related hemorrhage and the incidence of subtotal resection.",2021 Dec,2021,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society,94,,209-215,eng,True,S0967-5868(21)00543-9;10.1016/j.jocn.2021.10.036;S0967-5868(21)00543-9;10.1016/j.jocn.2021.10.036,Journal Article,"*Embolization, Therapeutic;Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery;Microsurgery;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects;Treatment Outcome",Intracranial arteriovenous malformation;Microsurgery;Radiosurgery
26990410,Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Arteriovenous Malformations: The Effect of Treatment Period on Patient Outcomes.,"BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has been performed on patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) for over 40 years. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of treatment period on obliteration, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), and radiation-induced complications (RICs). METHODS: Retrospective comparison of 381 AVM patients having SRS during a 20-year period (group 1, January 1990 through March 1997, n = 160; group 2, April 1997 through December 2009, n = 221). The median radiological and clinical follow-up after initial SRS was 77 months and 93 months, respectively. RESULTS: Obliteration was 59.1% at 4 years and 85.1% at 8 years. Obliteration was more common in patients with hemispheric or cerebellar AVMs (P = .001), smaller prescription isodose volume (PIV) (P < .001), and group 1 patients (P < .001). The ICH rate was 7.7% at 4 years and 10.6% at 8 years. ICH was more common in older patients (P = .02), patients with deep AVM (P = .01), and larger PIV (P < .001). There was no difference in the ICH rate between the treatment groups (P = .18). The rate of permanent RICs was 4.4% at 4 years and 8.6% at 8 years. RICs were more common with larger PIVs (P < .001) and group 1 patients (P = .02). There was no difference in the number of patients having obliteration without new deficits between the 2 treatment periods (68.8% vs 73.3%, P = .33). CONCLUSION: Advances in SRS procedures over the past 20 years have resulted in a lower risk of RIC, but fewer patients had AVM obliteration. Increasing the prescription dose for patients with medium- and large-volume AVMs by using current conformal dose-planning techniques may improve the obliteration rate while maintaining a low risk of RICs.",2016 Apr,2016,Neurosurgery,78,4,499-509,eng,True,10.1227/NEU.0000000000001085;00006123-201604000-00012;10.1227/NEU.0000000000001085,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Child;Child, Preschool;Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/*surgery;Intracranial Hemorrhages/etiology;Male;Middle Aged;Neurosurgical Procedures/adverse effects/*methods;Postoperative Hemorrhage/etiology;Radiation Injuries;Radiosurgery/adverse effects/*methods;Retrospective Studies;Risk Factors;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",
15050310,Efficacy and morbidity of arc-therapy radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations: a comparison with the natural history.,"PURPOSE: To report the results of arc-therapy radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) and to compare the adverse event rate with the rate expected from the natural history. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We performed a retrospective study of our 118 first patients with a mean follow-up of 46 months (range, 5-105 months). The AVMs had features indicating a poor prognosis at initial presentation and had already been treated by previous embolizations in 88% of patients. The mean volume of the targets was 7.4 cm3 (range, 0.3-28.3 cm3). The mean minimal and maximal dose was 17.7 Gy (range, 10-25 Gy) and 24.5 Gy (range, 17-36 Gy), respectively. RESULTS: The crude and 5-year actuarial rate of cure (total obstruction of the AVM shunt at angiography) was 54% (60 of 112) and 77%, respectively. The only independent prognostic factor of cure was the AVM volume (crude cure rate 67% for <7 cm3 vs. 35% for > or =7 cm3; p = 0.001). No patient died. Transient and permanent complications and hemorrhage occurred in 5%, 1.7%, and 6% of patients, respectively. The annual risk of an adverse event (hemorrhage or complication) was 3.9%.

37402570,Association of the combined stereotactic radiosurgery and embolization strategy and long-term outcomes in brain arteriovenous malformations with a volume ≤10 mL: a nationwide multicenter observational prospective cohort study.,"BACKGROUND: To compare the long-term outcomes of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) with or without prior embolization in brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) (volume ≤10 mL) for which SRS is indicated. METHODS: Patients were recruited from a nationwide multicenter prospective collaboration registry (the MATCH study) between August 2011 and August 2021, and categorized into combined embolization and SRS (E+SRS) and SRS alone cohorts. We performed propensity score-matched survival analysis to compare the long-term risk of non-fatal hemorrhagic stroke and death (primary outcomes). The long-term obliteration rate, favorable neurological outcomes, seizure, worsened mRS score, radiation-induced changes, and embolization complications were also evaluated (secondary outcomes). Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: After study exclusions and propensity score matching, 486 patients (243 pairs) were included. The median (IQR) follow-up duration for the primary outcomes was 5.7 (3.1-8.2) years. Overall, E+SRS and SRS alone were similar in preventing long-term non-fatal hemorrhagic stroke and death (0.68 vs 0.45 per 100 patient-years; HR=1.46 (95% CI 0.56 to 3.84)), as well as in facilitating AVM obliteration (10.02 vs 9.48 per 100 patient-years; HR=1.10 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.38)). However, the E+SRS strategy was significantly inferior to the SRS alone strategy in terms of neurological deterioration (worsened mRS score: 16.0% vs 9.1%; HR=2.00 (95% CI 1.18 to 3.38)).

METHODS: Thirty-one patients, each with an incidentally diagnosed AVM, underwent GKS between 1989 and 2009. The nidus volumes ranged from 0.3 to 11.1 cm(3) (median 3.2 cm(3)). A margin dose between 15 and 26 Gy (median 20 Gy) was used to treat the AVMs. Four patients underwent repeat GKS for still-patent AVM residuals after the initial GKS procedure. Clinical follow-up ranged from 24 to 196 months, with a mean of 78 months (median 51 months) after the initial GKS. RESULTS: Following GKS, 19 patients (61.3%) had a total AVM obliteration on angiography. In 7 patients (22.6%), no flow voids were observed on MRI but angiographic confirmation was not available. In 5 patients (16.1%), the AVMs remained patent. A small nidus volume was significantly associated with increased AVM obliteration rate. Thirteen patients (41.9%) developed radiation-induced imaging changes: 11 were asymptomatic (35.5%), 1 had only headache (3.2%), and 1 developed seizure and neurological deficits (3.2%). Two patients each had 1 hemorrhage during the latency period (116.5 risk years), yielding an annual hemorrhage rate of 1.7% before AVM obliteration. CONCLUSIONS: The decision to treat asymptomatic AVMs, and if so, which treatment approach to use, remain the subject of debate. GKS as a minimally invasive procedure appears to achieve a reasonable outcome with low procedure-related morbidity. In those patients with incidental AVMs, the benefits as well as the risks of radiosurgical intervention will only be fully defined with long-term follow-up.",2014 Nov,2014,Journal of neurosurgery,121,5,1015-21,eng,True,10.3171/2014.7.JNS131397;10.3171/2014.7.JNS131397,Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Cerebral Angiography;Child;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/mortality/*surgery;Intracranial Hemorrhages/epidemiology/etiology/mortality;Kaplan-Meier Estimate;Male;Middle Aged;Postoperative Complications/epidemiology;Radiosurgery/adverse effects/*methods;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult,ARUBA = A Randomized Trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformations;AVM = arteriovenous malformation;GKS = Gamma Knife surgery;Gamma Knife surgery;arteriovenous malformations;asymptomatic;hemorrhage;stereotactic radiosurgery;vascular disorders
39251110,Association of the combined stereotactic radiosurgery and embolization strategy and long-term outcomes in brain arteriovenous malformations with a volume >10 ml: A nationwide multicenter observational prospective cohort study.,"BACKGROUND: To assess the long-term outcome of large brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) (volume > 10 ml) underwent combined embolization and stereotactic radiosurgery (E+SRS) versus SRS alone. METHODS: Patients were recruited from a nationwide multicenter prospective collaboration registry (MATCH study, August 2011-August 2021) and categorized into E+SRS and SRS alone cohorts. Propensity score-matched survival analysis was employed to control for potential confounding variables. The primary outcome was a composite event of non-fatal hemorrhagic stroke or death. Secondary outcomes were favorable patient outcomes, AVM obliteration, favorable neurological outcomes, seizure, worsened mRS score, radiation-induced changes (RIC), and embolization complications. Furthermore, the efficacy of distinct embolization strategies was evaluated. Hazard ratios (HRs) were computed utilizing Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: Among 1063 AVMs who underwent SRS with or without prior embolization, 176 patients met the enrollment criteria. Following propensity score matching, the final analysis encompassed 98 patients (49 pairs). Median (interquartile range) follow-up duration for primary outcomes spanned 5.4 (2.7-8.4) years. Overall, the E+SRS strategy demonstrated a trend toward reduced incidence of primary outcomes compared to the SRS alone strategy (1.44 vs 2.37 per 100 patient-years; HR, 0.58 [95 % CI, 0.17-1.93]). Regardless of embolization degree or strategy, stratified analyses further consistently revealed a similar trend, albeit without achieving statistical significance. Secondary outcomes generally exhibited equivalence, but the combined approach showed potential superiority in most measures. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests a trend toward lower long-term non-fatal hemorrhagic stroke or death risks with the E+SRS strategy when compared to SRS alone in large AVMs (volume > 10 ml).",2024 Nov,2024,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic,200,,110530,eng,True,S0167-8140(24)03508-4;10.1016/j.radonc.2024.110530;S0167-8140(24)03508-4;10.1016/j.radonc.2024.110530,Journal Article;Multicenter Study;Observational Study,"Humans;*Radiosurgery/methods;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/therapy/radiotherapy;Male;Female;Prospective Studies;*Embolization, Therapeutic/methods;Adult;Middle Aged;Treatment Outcome;Combined Modality Therapy;Propensity Score",Brain arteriovenous malformation;Death;Embolization;Non-fatal hemorrhagic stroke;Obliteration;Stereotactic radiosurgery
36519863,Chronic Encapsulated Expanding Hematomas After Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations: An International Multicenter Case Series.,"BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) offers a minimally invasive treatment modality for appropriately selected intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Recent reports have described the development of rare, delayed chronic encapsulated expanding hematomas (CEEHs) at the site of an angiographically confirmed obliterated AVM. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the incidence, characteristics, and management of CEEH in patients with AVM after SRS. METHODS: The records of all patients who underwent SRS for an intracranial AVM at 4 institutions participating in the International Radiosurgery Research Foundation between 1987 and 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. Data regarding characteristics of the AVM, SRS treatment parameters, CEEH presentation, management, and outcomes were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Among 5430 patients, 15 developed a CEEH at a crude incidence of 0.28%. Nine patients were female, and the mean age was 43 ± 14.6 years. Nine patients underwent surgical evacuation, while 6 were managed conservatively. The median CEEH development latency was 106 months after SRS. The patients were followed for a median of 32 months, and 9 patients improved clinically, while 6 patients remained stable. No intraoperative complications were reported after CEEH resection, although 1 patient recovered from postoperative meningitis requiring intravenous antibiotics. CONCLUSION: CEEH is a rare, late complication of AVM SRS with an incidence of 0.28% and a median latency of 106 months. In the presence of a delayed and symptomatic expanding hematoma in the bed of an angiographically obliterated AVM, surgical resection resulted in clinical improvement in most patients.

37184633,Sporadic multiple cerebral arteriovenous malformations: case report and systematic review of additional 80 cases.,"INTRODUCTION: In absence of hereditary diseases multiple brain arteriovenous malformations are extremely rare. The case series that would include more than 13 patients are unlikely to be found, which causes an obstacle to comprehensively analyzing the peculiarities of epidemiology, symptoms and treatment options for this disorder. We describe patent with two independent arteriovenous malformations in frontal and parietal lobes that have been treated with combination of preoperative embolization, surgical excision and stereotactic radiosurgery. Systematic review of literature was also performed, focusing on epidemiology of sporadic multiple arteriovenous malformations, niduses location, clinical presentation, treatment and outcomes. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We systematically analyzed relevant literature using the PubMed database, encompassing studies in English (published between 1956 and 2023) reporting incidence, epidemiological features, symptomatology and treatment of sporadic multiple brain arteriovenous malformations. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Forty-eight studies with a total of 80 sporadic multiple cerebral arteriovenous malformations were extracted from the literature. Twenty-two papers reported incidence of multiple brain arteriovenous malformations. The average incidence (including our data) was 2.4%, varying significantly between children and adults. Hemorrhage from one AVM was the most frequent debut of multiple cerebral arteriovenous malformations. Surgical removal of niduses remains a valuable treatment option even considering the enhancement of embolization techniques and the development of radiosurgery. CONCLUSIONS: Sporadic multiple cerebral arteriovenous malformations represent a difficult problem to solve. The possibility of persistence of multiple brain arteriovenous malformations should be taken into account when diagnosing and following-up.",2024 Apr,2024,Journal of neurosurgical sciences,68,2,225-231,eng,False,10.23736/S0390-5616.23.06028-9;S0390-5616.23.06028-9;10.23736/S0390-5616.23.06028-9,Case Reports;Journal Article;Systematic Review,"Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery;*Radiosurgery/methods;Embolization, Therapeutic/methods;Adult;Female;Male;Neurosurgical Procedures/methods",

METHODS: The authors analyzed 7 pediatric AVM cases treated with volume-staged stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) using the Gamma Knife Perfexion at the University of California, San Francisco. The target and normal tissue contours from each case were exported for hypofractionated treatment planning based on the Gamma Knife Extend system or the CyberKnife SRT. Both the Gamma Knife Extend and CyberKnife treatment plans were matched to yield the same level of target coverage (95%-98%) and conformity indices (1.24-1.46). Finally, hypofractionated treatment plans were compared with volume-staged treatment plans for sparing normal brain by using biologically equivalent 12-Gy normal brain volumes. RESULTS: Hypofractionated Gamma Knife Extend and CyberKnife treatment plans exhibited practically identical sparing of normal brain for the studied cases. However, when matching such values with volume-staged treatments for the biological effective dose, only conservative dose fractionation schemes, such as 27.3 Gy in 5 fractions and 25 Gy in 4 fractions, were found to be comparable to the volume-staged treatments. On average, this represents a mean 18.7% ± 7.3% reduction in the single-fraction biologically equivalent dose for hypofractionated treatments versus the reference volume-staged treatments (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Volume staging remains advantageous over hypofractionation in delivering a higher dose to the target and for better sparing of normal brain tissue in the treatment of large AVMs. More clinical data are needed, however, to justify the clinical superiority of this increased dose when compared with a hypofractionated treatment regimen.",2012 Dec,2012,Journal of neurosurgery,117 Suppl,,115-9,eng,False,10.3171/2012.7.GKS121023;10.3171/2012.7.GKS121023,Journal Article,"Brain/pathology/*surgery;Child;Dose Fractionation, Radiation;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/pathology/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Radiosurgery/*instrumentation/methods;Treatment Outcome",
24803036,Linear accelerator-based radiosurgery alone for arteriovenous malformation: more than 12 years of observation.,"PURPOSE: Although radiosurgery is an accepted treatment method for intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), its long-term therapeutic effects have not been sufficiently evaluated, and many reports of long-term observations are from gamma-knife facilities. Furthermore, there are few reported results of treatment using only linear accelerator (LINAC)-based radiosurgery (LBRS). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Over a period of more than 12 years, we followed the long-term results of LBRS treatment performed in 51 AVM patients. RESULTS: The actuarial obliteration rates, after a single radiosurgery session, at 3, 5, 10, and 15 years were 46.9%, 54.0%, 64.4%, and 68.0%, respectively; when subsequent radiosurgeries were included, the rates were 46.9%, 61.3%, 74.2%, and 90.3%, respectively. Obliteration rates were significantly related to target volumes ≥4 cm(3), marginal doses ≥12 Gy, Spetzler-Martin grades (1 vs other), and AVM scores ≥1.5; multivariate analyses revealed a significant difference for target volumes ≥4 cm(3). The postprocedural actuarial symptomatic radiation injury rates, after a single radiation surgery session, at 5, 10, and 15 years were 12.3%, 16.8%, and 19.1%, respectively. Volumes ≥4 cm(3), location (lobular or other), AVM scores ≥1.5, and the number of radiosurgery were related to radiation injury incidence; multivariate analyses revealed significant differences associated with volumes ≥4 cm(3) and location (lobular or other). CONCLUSIONS: Positive results can be obtained with LBRS when performed with a target volume ≤4 cm(3), an AVM score ≤1.5, and ≥12 Gy radiation.

29611866,Gamma knife radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations: general principles and preliminary results in a Swiss cohort.,"INTRODUCTION: Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are a type of vascular malformation characterised by an abnormal connection between arteries and veins, bypassing the capillary system. This absence of capillaries generates an elevated pressure (hyperdebit), in both the AVM and the venous drainage, increasing the risk of rupture. Management modalities are: observation, microsurgical clipping, endovascular treatment and radiosurgery. The former can be used alone or in the frame of a multidisciplinary approach. We review our single-institution experience with gamma knife radiosurgery (GKR) over a period of 5 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was open-label, prospective and nonrandomised. Fifty-seven consecutive patients, benefitting from 64 GKR treatments, were included. All were treated with Leksell Gamma Knife Perfexion (Elekta Instruments, AB, Sweden) between July 2010 and August 2015. All underwent stereotactic multimodal imaging: standard digital subtraction angiography, magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography angiography. We report obliteration rates, radiation-induced complications and haemorrhages during follow-up course. RESULTS: The mean age was 46 years (range 13-79 years). The mean follow-up period was 36.4 months (median 38, range 12-75 months). Most common pretherapeutic clinical presentation was haemorrhage (50%). The most common Pollock-Flickinger score was between 1.01 and 1.5 (46%) and Spetzler-Martin grade III (46%). In 39 (60.1%) of cases, GKR was performed as upfront therapeutic option. The mean gross target volume (GTV) was 2.3 ml (median 1.2, range 0.03-11.3 ml). Mean marginal dose was 22.4 Gy (median 24, range 18-24 Gy). The mean prescription isodose volume (PIV) was 2.9 ml (median 1.8, range 0.065-14.6 ml). The overall obliteration rates (all treatments combined) at 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months were 4.8, 16.9%, 37.4, 63.6 and 78.4%, respectively. The main predictive factors for complete obliteration were: higher mean marginal dose (23.3 vs 21.0 Gy), lower GTV (mean 1.5 vs 3.5 ml) and absence of previous embolisation (at 60 months 61.8% prior embolisation compared with 82.4% without prior embolisation) (for all p <0.05). Eight (14%) patients experienced complications after GKR. Overall definitive morbidity rate was 3.1%. No patient died from causes related to GKR. However, during the obliteration period, one case of extremely rare fatal haemorrhage occurred. CONCLUSION: Radiosurgery is a safe and effective treatment modality for intracranial AVMs in selected cases. It can be used as upfront therapy or in the frame of a combined management. Obliteration rates are high, with minimal morbidity. The treatment effect is progressive and subsequent and regular clinical and radiological follow-up is needed to evaluate this effect.",2018,2018,Swiss medical weekly,148,,w14602,eng,False,10.4414/smw.2018.14602;smw-14602;10.4414/smw.2018.14602,Clinical Trial;Journal Article,Female;Hemorrhage/etiology;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/classification/diagnostic;Male;Middle Aged;*Postoperative Complications;Prospective Studies;Radiosurgery/*methods;Switzerland;Treatment Outcome,

METHODS: Forty-five patients who underwent time-staged GKS (2-stage, n = 37;3-stage,n = 8) between March 1998 and December 2011 were included. The mean volume treated was 20.42±6.29 cm3 (range, 10.20-38.50 cm3). Obliteration rates of AVMs and the associated complications after GKS were evaluated. RESULTS: Mean AVM volume (and median marginal dose) at each GKS session in the 37 patients who underwent 2-stage GKS was 19.67±6.08 cm3 (13 Gy) at session 1 and 6.97±6.92 cm3 (17 Gy) at session 2. The median interval period was 39 months. After follow-up period of 37 months, the complete obliteration rate was 64.9%. The mean AVM volume (and median marginal dose) at each GKS session in the 8 patients who underwent 3-stage GKS was 23.90±6.50 cm3 (12.25 Gy), 19.43±7.46 cm3 (13.5 Gy), 7.48±6.86 cm3 (15.5 Gy) at session 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The median interval duration between each GKS session was 37.5 and 38 months, respectively. After a median follow-up period of 47.5 months, 5 patients (62.5%) achieved complete obliteration. Postradiosurgical hemorrhage developed in 5 patients (11.1%) including one case of major bleeding and 4 cases of minor bleeding.

28555270,"Critical review of brain AVM surgery, surgical results and natural history in 2017.","BACKGROUND: An understanding of the present standing of surgery, surgical results and the role in altering the future morbidity and mortality of untreated brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) is appropriate considering the myriad alternative management pathways (including radiosurgery, embolization or some combination of treatments), varying risks and selection biases that have contributed to confusion regarding management. The purpose of this review is to clarify the link between the incidence of adverse outcomes that are reported from a management pathway of either surgery or no intervention with the projected risks of surgery or no intervention. METHODS: A critical review of the literature was performed on the outcomes of surgery and non-intervention for bAVM. An analysis of the biases and how these may have influenced the outcomes was included to attempt to identify reasonable estimates of risks. RESULTS: In the absence of treatment, the cumulative risk of future hemorrhage is approximately 16% and 29% at 10 and 20 years after diagnosis of bAVM without hemorrhage and 35% and 45% at 10 and 20 years when presenting with hemorrhage (annualized, this risk would be approximately 1.8% for unruptured bAVMs and 4.7% for 8 years for bAVMs presenting with hemorrhage followed by the unruptured bAVM rate). The cumulative outcome of these hemorrhages depends upon whether the patient remains untreated and is allowed to have a further hemorrhage or is treated at this time. Overall, approximately 42% will develop a new permanent neurological deficit or death from a hemorrhagic event. The presence of an associated proximal intracranial aneurysm (APIA) and restriction of venous outflow may increase the risk for subsequent hemorrhage. Other risks for increased risk of hemorrhage (age, pregnancy, female) were examined, and their purported association with hemorrhage is difficult to support. Both the Spetzler-Martin grading system (and its compaction into the Spetzler-Ponce tiers) and Lawton-Young supplementary grading system are excellent in predicting the risk of surgery. The 8-year risk of unfavorable outcome from surgery (complication leading to a permanent new neurological deficit with a modified Rankin Scale score of greater than one, residual bAVM or recurrence) is dependent on bAVM size, the presence of deep venous drainage (DVD) and location in critical brain (eloquent location). For patients with bAVMs who have neither a DVD nor eloquent location, the 8-year risk for an unfavorable outcome increases with size (increasing from 1 cm to 6 cm) from 1% to 9%. For patients with bAVM who have either a DVD or eloquent location (but not both), the 8-year risk for an unfavorable outcome increases with the size (increasing from 1 cm to 6 cm) from 4% to 35%. For patients with bAVM who have both a DVD and eloquent location, the 8-year risk for unfavorable outcome increases with size (increasing from 1 cm to 3 cm) from 12% to 38%.

34844005,Upfront and Repeated Gamma-Knife Radiosurgery for Small (≤5 mL) Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformation: A Cohort of 249 Consecutive Patients.,"OBJECTIVE: According to A Randomized Trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformations (ARUBA), conservative treatment seems to be superior to any intervention for unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). This study aims to evaluate safety and efficacy of upfront and repeated Gamma-Knife Radiosurgery (GKRS) in patients harboring small AVMs fulfilling the inclusion criteria of ARUBA. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate outcomes of unruptured naive brain AVM with a volume ⩽ 5 mL eligible to ARUBA treated by GKRS with at least 3 years of follow-up. RESULTS: From 1992 to 2014, 249 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria of this study. The median age was 36 years (range: 18-78 years). The median treated volume of the nidus was 1.3 mL (range: 0.4-5 mL) and 63% of the AVM were in eloquent areas. Radiosurgery-based AVM score was 1-1.8 (76%), the Spetzler-Martin grade was II-III (73%), and the Virginia Radiosurgery AVM scale was ≤1 point (75%). The overall AVM obliteration rate was 77.1% after up to 3 GKRS sessions. The median dose at the margin was 24 Gy (15-25 Gy) and the median follow-up was 45 months (range: 36-205 months). Eight patients (3.2%) experienced hemorrhage after GKRS, corresponding to a post-GKRS hemorrhage annual rate of 1.03%. Permanent symptomatic radio-induced changes rate was 2% (4 increased seizures, 1 neurologic deficit). CONCLUSIONS: The very low toxicity rate and the high occlusion rate suggest in favor of upfront and repeated GKRS for unruptured small AVMs (⩽5 mL).",2022 Feb,2022,World neurosurgery,158,,e889-e895,eng,True,S1878-8750(21)01804-0;10.1016/j.wneu.2021.11.091;S1878-8750(21)01804-0;10.1016/j.wneu.2021.11.091,Journal Article,Adult;Brain;Follow-Up Studies;Hemorrhage/surgery;Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/radiotherapy/surgery;*Nervous System Malformations/surgery;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome,ARUBA;Brain arteriovenous malformation;Gamma-Knife;Stereotactic radiosurgery;Unruptured vascular malformation
24766309,"Stereotactic radiosurgery at a low marginal dose for the treatment of pediatric arteriovenous malformations: obliteration, complications, and functional outcomes.","OBJECT.: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is an established treatment modality for brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in children, but the optimal treatment parameters and associated treatment-related complications are not fully understood. The authors present their single-institution experience of using SRS, at a relatively low marginal dose, to treat AVMs in children for nearly 20 years; they report angiographic outcomes, posttreatment hemorrhage rates, adverse treatment-related events, and functional outcomes. METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective review of 2 cohorts of children (18 years of age or younger) with AVMs treated from 1991 to 1998 and from 2000 to 2010. RESULTS: A total of 80 patients with follow-up data after SRS were identified. Mean age at SRS was 12.7 years, and 56% of patients had hemorrhage at the time of presentation. Median target volume was 3.1 cm(3) (range 0.09-62.3 cm(3)), and median prescription marginal dose used was 17.5 Gy (range 12-20 Gy). Angiograms acquired 3 years after treatment were available for 47% of patients; AVM obliteration was achieved in 52% of patients who received a dose of 18-20 Gy and in 16% who received less than 18 Gy. At 5 years after SRS, the cumulative incidence of hemorrhage was 25% (95% CI 16%-37%). No permanent neurological deficits occurred in patients who did not experience posttreatment hemorrhage. Overall, good functional outcomes (modified Rankin Scale Scores 0-2) were observed for 78% of patients; for 66% of patients, functional status improved or remained the same as before treatment. CONCLUSIONS: A low marginal dose minimizes SRS-related neurological deficits but leads to low rates of obliteration and high rates of hemorrhage. To maximize AVM obliteration and minimize posttreatment hemorrhage, the authors recommend a prescription marginal dose of 18 Gy or more. In addition, SRS-related symptoms such as headache and seizures should be considered when discussing risks and benefits of SRS for treating AVMs in children.",2014 Jul,2014,Journal of neurosurgery.

25840878,Clinical outcome and complications of gamma knife radiosurgery for intracranial arteriovenous malformations.,"We sought to evaluate the outcome of intracranial arteriovenous malformation (AVM) treated with gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) (Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden) as a primary treatment as well as an adjunct therapy. GKRS has emerged as an important treatment option for intracranial AVM. However, the long term outcome of GKRS on AVM is not well understood. We performed a retrospective review of 85 patients with AVM from 2000-2012 who received GKRS. Out of 85 patients, 13 had undergone prior embolization. The study population was monitored clinically and radiographically after GKRS treatment. Outcome following GKRS for intracranial AVM showed significant variations in nidus obliteration (obliteration in 67 [79%] patients and increase of nidus size on MRI in 18 [21%] patients). The median time to nidus obliteration was 31 months. Overall two (2.3%) patients had intracranial bleeding and the annual bleeding risk was 1.6% after GKRS. Predictive factors for obliteration of the nidus in patients with AVM were low AVM score, Spetzler-Martin grade I-III and female sex. Seventeen (20%) and one (1.17%) patients underwent repeat GKRS and resection, respectively, after initial GKRS, due to increased size of the nidus and GKRS related cyst formation. Thus, GKRS offers a high obliteration rate of AVM, low risk of intracranial bleeding and neurological morbidity, both as primary modality and as an adjunctive treatment. Therefore, GKRS is an effective treatment option for new patients with AVM as well as an adjuvant therapy in patients with recurrent AVM.",2015 Jul,2015,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society,22,7,1117-22,eng,True,S0967-5868(15)00065-X;10.1016/j.jocn.2014.12.017;S0967-5868(15)00065-X;10.1016/j.jocn.2014.12.017,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Embolization, Therapeutic;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Intracranial Hemorrhages/etiology;Male;Middle Aged;Nervous System Diseases/epidemiology/etiology;Postoperative Complications/epidemiology;Prognosis;Radiosurgery/adverse effects/*methods;Reoperation;Retrospective Studies;Sex Factors;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",Arteriovenous malformation;Outcome and complications;Predictive factors;Radiosurgery
27903195,Dosimetric effects of Onyx embolization on Gamma Knife arteriovenous malformation dose distributions.,"OBJECTIVE Patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) subsequent to embolization suffer from elevated local failure rates and differences in adverse radiation effects. Onyx is a common embolic material for AVMs. Onyx is formulated with tantalum, a high atomic number (Z = 73) element that has been investigated as a source of dosimetric uncertainty contributing to the less favorable clinical results. However, prior studies have not modeled the complicated anatomical and beam geometries characteristic of GKRS. This study investigated the magnitude of dose perturbation that can occur due to Onyx embolization using clinically realistic anatomical and Gamma Knife beam models. METHODS Leksell GammaPlan (LGP) was used to segment the AVM nidus and areas of Onyx from postcontrast stereotactic MRI for 7 patients treated with GKRS postembolization. The resulting contours, skull surface, and clinically selected dose distributions were exported from LGP in DICOM-RT (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine-radiotherapy) format. Isocenter locations and dwell times were recorded from the LGP database. Contours were converted into 3D mesh representations using commercial and in-house mesh-editing software. The resulting data were imported into a Monte Carlo (MC) dose calculation engine (Pegasos, Elekta Instruments AB) with a beam geometry for the Gamma Knife Perfexion. The MC-predicted dose distributions were calculated with Onyx assigned manufacturer-reported physical constants (MC-Onyx), and then compared with corresponding distributions in which Onyx was reassigned constants for water (MC-water). Differences in dose metrics were determined, including minimum, maximum, and mean dose to the AVM nidus; selectivity index; and target coverage. Combined differences in dose magnitude and distance to agreement were calculated as 3D Gamma analysis passing rates using tolerance criteria of 0.5%/0.5 mm, 1.0%/1.0 mm, and 3.0%/3.0 mm. RESULTS Overall, the mean percentage differences in dose metrics for MC-Onyx relative to MC-water were as follows; all data are reported as mean (SD): minimum dose to AVM = -0.7% (1.4%), mean dose to AVM = 0.1% (0.2%), maximum dose to AVM = 2.9% (5.0%), selectivity = 0.1% (0.2%), and coverage = -0.0% (0.2%). The mean percentage of voxels passing at each Gamma tolerance were as follows: 99.7% (0.1%) for 3.0%/3.0 mm, 98.2% (0.7%) for 1.0%/1.0 mm, and 52.1% (4.4%) for 0.5%/0.5 mm. CONCLUSIONS Onyx embolization appears to have a detectable effect on the delivered dose distribution. However, the small changes in dose metrics and high Gamma passing rates at 1.0%/1.0 mm tolerance suggest that these changes are unlikely to be clinically significant. Additional sources of delivery and biological uncertainty should be investigated to determine the root cause of the observed less favorable postembolization GKRS outcomes.",2016 Dec,2016,Journal of neurosurgery,125,Suppl 1,114-122,eng,False,10.3171/2016.6.GKS161502,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Combined Modality Therapy;Embolization, Therapeutic/*methods;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*therapy;*Radiosurgery;Radiotherapy Dosage;*Tantalum",AVM;AVM = arteriovenous malformation;DTA = distance to agreement;GKRS = Gamma Knife radiosurgery;Gamma Knife;LGP = Leksell GammaPlan;MC = Monte Carlo;NBCA = N-butyl cyanoacrylate;STL = stereolithography;embolization;stereotactic radiosurgery
37796152,Effect of Cobalt-60 Treatment Dose Rate on Arteriovenous Malformation Obliteration After Stereotactic Radiosurgery With Gamma Knife.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) marginal dose is associated with successful obliteration of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM). SRS dose rate-how old the cobalt-60 sources are-is known to influence outcomes for some neurological conditions and benign tumors. The objective of this study was to determine the association between cobalt-60 treatment dose rate and cerebral AVM obliteration in patients treated with SRS. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 361 patients undergoing 411 AVM-directed SRS treatments between 2005 and 2019 at a single institution. Lesion characteristics, SRS details, obliteration dates, and post-treatment toxicities were recorded. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses of AVM outcomes regarding SRS dose rate (range 1.3-3.7 Gy, mean = 2.4 Gy, median = 2.5 Gy) were performed. RESULTS: At 10 years post-SRS, 68% of AVMs were obliterated on follow-up imaging. Dose rates >2.9 Gy/min were found to be significantly associated with AVM obliteration compared with those <2.1 Gy/min ( P = .034). AVM size, biologically effective dose, and SRS marginal dose were also associated with obliteration, with obliteration more likely for smaller lesions, higher biologically effective dose, and higher marginal dose. Higher dose rates were not associated with the development of post-SRS radiological or symptomatic edema, although larger AVM volume was associated with both types of edema. CONCLUSION: Patients with cerebral AVMs treated with higher SRS dose rates (from newer cobalt-60 sources) experience higher incidences of obliteration without a significant change in the risk of post-treatment edema.",2024 Mar 1,2024,Neurosurgery,94,3,575-583,eng,True,10.1227/neu.0000000000002701;00006123-202403000-00018;10.1227/neu.0000000000002701,Journal Article,Humans;Treatment Outcome;Retrospective Studies;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects/methods;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/pathology;Doxorubicin;Edema/etiology/surgery;Follow-Up Studies;*Cobalt Radioisotopes,
31792505,Stagnant Venous Outflow Predicts Brain Arteriovenous Malformation Obliteration After Gamma Knife Radiosurgery Without Prior Intervention.,"BACKGROUND: Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) obliterates 65% to 82% of brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVMs). OBJECTIVE: To explore the impact of hemodynamics on GKRS outcomes. METHODS: We retrospectively (2011-2017) included 98 patients with BAVMs who had received GKRS alone. Two evaluators, blinded to the outcomes, analyzed the pre-GKRS angiography and magnetic resonance images to obtain the morphological characteristics and quantitative digital subtraction angiography (QDSA) parameters. The venous stasis index was defined as the inflow gradient divided by the absolute value of the outflow gradient. Patients' follow-up magnetic resonance or digital subtraction angiography images were evaluated for the presence of complete obliteration (CO). Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses were conducted to determine the correlations between the parameters and outcomes. RESULTS: Among the 98 patients, 63 (63.4%) achieved CO after GKRS at a median latency period of 31 mo. In multivariable analyses with adjustments for age and sex, increased BAVM volume (hazard ratio (HR) 0.949, P = .022) was an independent characteristic predictor, and venous stenosis (HR 2.595, P = .009), venous rerouting (HR 0.375, P = .022), and larger stasis index (HR 1.227, P = .025) were independent angiographic predictors of CO. BAVMs with a stasis index of >1.71 had a higher 36-mo probability of CO than those with a stasis index of ≤1.71 (61.1% vs 26.7%, P < .001). CONCLUSION: BAVMs with a larger stasis index, indicating more stagnant venous outflow, may predict obliteration after GKRS.

26805683,Microsurgical Resection for Persistent Arteriovenous Malformations Following Gamma Knife Radiosurgery: A Case-Control Study.,"OBJECTIVE: To explore outcomes after microsurgery of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) that failed to be obliterated by Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS). METHODS: From January 2000 to January 2014, 42 consecutive patients underwent surgical resection of persistent AVMs after GKRS. These 42 patients with AVMs who underwent radiosurgery (radiosurgery group) were individually matched with 42 patients with AVMs who did not undergo radiosurgery (no radiosurgery group) based on patient and AVM characteristics. The modified Rankin Scale was used to assess neurologic status of patients. The effects of GKRS on AVM resection and surgical outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: After GKRS, the mean AVM volume was significantly reduced by 76.8% (P < 0.01), the size was reduced by 41% (P < 0.01), and the Spetzler-Martin grade was reduced in 61.9% of the patients (P < 0.01). During the time interval from radiosurgery to surgical resection, subsequent hemorrhages led to significant neurologic deterioration (P = 0.046). Compared with the control group, the frequency of preoperative embolization, operative time, and blood loss were significantly lower in the radiosurgery group (all P < 0.05). The no radiosurgery group had a significantly higher rate of worsening in mRS scores at 6 months after surgery (40.5% vs. 16.7%, P = 0.029). Good neurologic status (mRS score <3) was achieved in 81% of the radiosurgery group and 83% of the no radiosurgery group at the final follow-up evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: GKRS performed several years before microsurgical resection can facilitate resectability of AVMs and decrease the rate of postoperative neurologic deterioration. For patients with persistent AVMs several years after GKRS, microsurgical resection is recommended to achieve good clinical outcomes.",2016 Apr,2016,World neurosurgery,88,,277-288,eng,False,S1878-8750(16)00110-8;10.1016/j.wneu.2016.01.027;S1878-8750(16)00110-8;10.1016/j.wneu.2016.01.027,"Controlled Clinical Trial;Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Adult;Cerebral Revascularization/*methods;Combined Modality Therapy;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnosis/*surgery;Male;Radiosurgery/*methods;Recurrence;Treatment Failure,Gamma Knife radiosurgery;Microsurgical resection;Persistent arteriovenous malformations
24021345,Multi-staged robotic stereotactic radiosurgery for large cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"PURPOSE: To investigate a multi-staged robotic stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) delivery technique for the treatment of large cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). The treatment planning process and strategies to optimize both individual and composite dosimetry are discussed. METHODS: Eleven patients with large (30.7 ± 19.2 cm(3)) AVMs were selected for this study. A fiducial system was designed for fusion of targets between planar angiograms and simulation CT scans. AVMs were contoured based on single contrast CT, MRI and orthogonal angiogram images. AVMs were divided into 3-8 sub-target volumes (3-7 cm(3)) for sequential treatment at 1-4 week intervals to a prescription dose of 16-20 Gy. Forward and inversely developed treatment plans were optimized for 95% coverage of the total AVM volume by dose summation from each sub-volume, while minimizing dose to surrounding tissues. Dose-volume analysis was used to evaluate the PTV coverage, dose conformality (CI), and R50 and V12 Gy parameters. RESULTS: The treatment workflow was commissioned and able to localize within 1mm. Inverse optimization outperformed forward planning for most patients for each index considered. Dose conformality was shown comparable to staged Gamma Knife treatments. CONCLUSION: The CyberKnife system is shown to be a practical delivery platform for multi-staged treatments of large AVMs using forward or inverse planning techniques.",2013 Dec,2013,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic,109,3,452-6,eng,False,S0167-8140(13)00395-2;10.1016/j.radonc.2013.07.018;S0167-8140(13)00395-2;10.1016/j.radonc.2013.07.018,Journal Article,"Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional/methods;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods;Radiosurgery/instrumentation/*methods;Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted/*methods;Robotics/instrumentation/*methods",Arteriovenous malformations;CyberKnife;Stereotactic radiosurgery
28128692,Volume-staged versus dose-staged stereotactic radiosurgery outcomes for large brain arteriovenous malformations: a systematic review.,"OBJECTIVE Several recent studies have improved our understanding of the outcomes of volume-staged (VS) and dose-staged (DS) stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for the treatment of large (volume > 10 cm(3)) brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). In light of these recent additions to the literature, the aim of this systematic review is to provide an updated comparison of VS-SRS and DS-SRS for large AVMs. METHODS A systematic review of the literature was performed using PubMed to identify cohorts of 5 or more patients with large AVMs who had been treated with VS-SRS or DS-SRS. Baseline data and post-SRS outcomes were extracted for analysis. RESULTS A total of 11 VS-SRS and 10 DS-SRS studies comprising 299 and 219 eligible patients, respectively, were included for analysis. The mean obliteration rates for VS-SRS and DS-SRS were 41.2% (95% CI 31.4%-50.9%) and 32.3% (95% CI 15.9%-48.8%), respectively. Based on pooled individual patient data, the outcomes for patients treated with VS-SRS were obliteration in 40.3% (110/273), symptomatic radiation-induced changes (RICs) in 13.7% (44/322), post-SRS hemorrhage in 19.5% (50/256), and death in 7.4% (24/323); whereas the outcomes for patients treated with DS-SRS were obliteration in 32.7% (72/220), symptomatic RICs in 12.2% (31/254), post-SRS hemorrhage in 10.6% (30/282), and death in 4.6% (13/281). CONCLUSIONS Volume-staged SRS appears to afford higher obliteration rates than those achieved with DS-SRS, although with a less favorable complication profile. Therefore, VS-SRS or DS-SRS may be a reasonable treatment approach for large AVMs, either as stand-alone therapy or as a component of a multimodality management strategy.",2018 Jan,2018,Journal of neurosurgery,128,1,154-164,eng,False,2016.9.JNS161571;10.3171/2016.9.JNS161571;2016.9.JNS161571;10.3171/2016.9.JNS161571,Comparative Study;Journal Article;Systematic Review,Arteriovenous Fistula/*radiotherapy;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*radiotherapy;Radiosurgery/*methods,AVM = arteriovenous malformation;DS-SRS = dose-staged SRS;GK = Gamma Knife;Gamma Knife;LINAC = linear accelerator;RIC = radiation-induced change;SRS = stereotactic radiosurgery;SS-SRS = single-session SRS;VS-SRS = volume-staged SRS;arteriovenous malformation;dose-staged;radiosurgery;review;stereotactic radiosurgery;vascular disorders;volume-staged
23205803,Outcome after Gamma Knife surgery for intracranial arteriovenous malformations in children.,"OBJECT: The focus of the present study was the evaluation of outcomes after unstaged and staged-volume Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) in children harboring intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). METHODS: Twenty-two children (median age 9.5 years) underwent GKS for AVMs and were followed up for at least 2 years thereafter. The disease manifested with intracranial hemorrhage in 77% of cases. In 68% of patients the lesion affected eloquent brain structures. The volume of the nidus ranged from 0.1 to 6.7 cm(3). Gamma Knife surgery was guided mainly by data from dynamic contrast-enhanced CT scans, with preferential targeting of the junction between the nidus and draining vein. The total prescribed isodose volume was kept below 4.0 cm(3), and the median margin dose was 22 Gy (range 20-25 Gy). If the volume of the nidus was larger than 4.0 cm(3), a second radiosurgical session was planned for 3-4 years after the first one. Nine patients in the present series underwent unstaged radiosurgery, whereas staged-volume treatment was scheduled in 13 patients. RESULTS: Complete obliteration of the AVM was noted in 17 (77%) of 22 patients within a median period of 47 months after the last radiosurgical session. Complete obliteration of the lesion occurred in 89% of patients after unstaged treatment and in 62.5% after staged GKS. Four (67%) of 6 high-grade AVMs were completely obliterated. Complications included 3 bleeding episodes, the appearance of a region of hyperintensity on T(2)-weighted MR images in 2 patients who had no symptoms, and reappearance of the nidus in the vicinity of the completely obliterated AVM in 1 patient. CONCLUSIONS: Radiosurgery is a highly effective management option for intracranial AVMs in children. For larger lesions, staged GKS may be applied successfully. Initial targeting of the nidus adjacent to the draining vein and application of a sufficient radiation dose to a relatively small volume (≤ 4 cm(3)) provides a good balance between a high probability of obliteration and a low risk of treatment-related complications.",2012 Dec,2012,Journal of neurosurgery,117 Suppl,,150-7,eng,False,10.3171/2012.7.GKS12998;10.3171/2012.7.GKS12998,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Brain/*surgery;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/*surgery;Intracranial Hemorrhages/etiology;Male;Radiosurgery/adverse effects/*instrumentation;Treatment Outcome",
20605347,A modified radiosurgery-based arteriovenous malformation grading scale and its correlation with outcomes.,"PURPOSE: The Pittsburgh radiosurgery-based arteriovenous malformation (AVM) grading scale was developed to predict patient outcomes after radiosurgery and was later modified with location as a two-tiered variable (deep vs. other). The purpose of this study was to test the modified radiosurgery-based AVM score in a separate set of AVM patients managed with radiosurgery. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The AVM score is calculated as follows: AVM score = (0.1)(volume, cc) + (0.02)(age, years) + (0.5)(location; frontal/temporal/parietal/occipital/intraventricular/corpus callosum/cerebellar = 0, basal ganglia/thalamus/brainstem = 1). Testing of the modified system was performed on 293 patients having AVM radiosurgery from 1992 to 2004 at the University of Pittsburgh with dose planning based on a combination of stereotactic angiography and MRI. The median patient age was 38 years, the median AVM volume was 3.3 cc, and 57 patients (19%) had deep AVMs. The median modified AVM score was 1.25. The median patient follow-up was 39 months. RESULTS: The modified AVM scale correlated with the percentage of patients with AVM obliteration without new deficits (≤1.00, 62%; 1.01-1.50, 51%; 1.51-2.00, 53%; and >2.00, 32%; F = 11.002, R(2) = 0.8117, p = 0.001). Linear regression also showed a statistically significant correlation between outcome and dose prescribed to the margin (F = 25.815, p <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The modified radiosurgery-based AVM grading scale using location as a two-tiered variable correlated with outcomes when tested on a cohort of patients who underwent both angiography and MRI for dose planning. This system can be used to guide choices among observation, endovascular, surgical, and radiosurgical management strategies for individual AVM patients.",2011 Mar 15,2011,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",79,4,1147-50,eng,False,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2009.12.056;S0360-3016(10)00005-2;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2009.12.056,Evaluation Study;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/mortality/pathology/*surgery;Linear Models;Male;Middle Aged;Postoperative Hemorrhage/mortality;Radiosurgery/adverse effects/instrumentation/*methods/mortality;Radiotherapy Dosage;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",
22284685,Frameless angiogram-based stereotactic radiosurgery for treatment of arteriovenous malformations.,"PURPOSE: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is an effective alternative to microsurgical resection or embolization for definitive treatment of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is the gold standard for pretreatment diagnosis and characterization of vascular anatomy, but requires rigid frame (skull) immobilization when used in combination with SRS. With the advent of advanced proton and image-guided photon delivery systems, SRS treatment is increasingly migrating to frameless platforms, which are incompatible with frame-based DSA. Without DSA as the primary image, target definition may be less than optimal, in some cases precluding the ability to treat with a frameless system. This article reports a novel solution. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fiducial markers are implanted into the patient's skull before angiography. Angiography is performed according to the standard clinical protocol, but, in contrast to the previous practice, without the rigid frame. Separate images of a specially designed localizer box are subsequently obtained. A target volume projected on DSA can be transferred to the localizer system in three dimensions, and in turn be transferred to multiple CT slices using the implanted fiducials. Combined with other imaging modalities, this ""virtual frame"" approach yields a highly precise treatment plan that can be delivered by frameless SRS technologies. RESULTS: Phantom measurements for point and volume targets have been performed. The overall uncertainty of placing a point target to CT is 0.4 mm. For volume targets, deviation of the transformed contour from the target CT image is within 0.6 mm. The algorithm and software are robust. The method has been applied clinically, with reliable results. CONCLUSIONS: A novel and reproducible method for frameless SRS of AVMs has been developed that enables the use of DSA without the requirement for rigid immobilization. Multiple pairs of DSA can be used for better conformality. Further improvement, including using nonimplanted fiducials, is potentially feasible.",2012 Sep 1,2012,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",84,1,274-82,eng,False,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2011.10.044;S0360-3016(11)03452-3;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2011.10.044,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Algorithms;Angiography, Digital Subtraction/methods;Cerebral Angiography/methods;*Fiducial Markers;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/methods;Immobilization/instrumentation;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Phantoms, Imaging;Radiosurgery/*methods/trends;Reproducibility of Results;Tomography, X-Ray Computed/methods",
29066317,Does Advanced Age Affect the Outcomes of Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformation?,"BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is generally considered a minimally invasive treatment modality. However, definitive evidence of the efficacy of SRS in the elderly population is still not available. METHODS: The outcomes of 561 elderly and nonelderly patients who underwent SRS for AVM at our institution between 1990 and 2013 were reviewed, analyzed, and compared. Elderly patients were defined as those age ≥60 years at the time of SRS. RESULTS: The elderly cohort comprised 55 patients; the nonelderly cohort, 506. In the elderly cohort, the median age was 65 years, and the duration of follow-up was 91 months. The actuarial obliteration rates were 47% at 3 years, 70% at 4 years, and 76% at 5 years in the elderly cohort, and 57% at 3 years, 76% at 4 years, and 83% at 5 years in the nonelderly cohort. In the elderly cohort, the hemorrhage rates during the post-SRS latent phase were 5.2%/year in patients with hemorrhagic onset and 0%/year in those with nonhemorrhagic onset, and event-free survival (EFS) was 93% at 6 years and 89% at 12 years. The obliteration rate, mortality, and EFS rate were not significantly different between the 2 cohorts, whereas the rate of perifocal edema was significantly lower (P = 0.021) in the elderly cohort. The pre-SRS and post-SRS hemorrhage rates were slightly higher in the elderly cohort, albeit without statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic effects and outcomes of SRS are similar in elderly and nonelderly patients.

25293662,Application of single-stage stereotactic radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations >10 cm3.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a safe and effective treatment for small arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), the use of this modality for the treatment of large AVMs is still controversial, although it has been used in difficult cases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the treatment outcomes of patients who underwent single-stage SRS for large AVMs and to discuss the role of SRS in the treatment of these challenging lesions. METHODS: Between 1998 and 2010, 65 patients with AVMs >10 cm(3) underwent single-stage SRS using the Leksell Gamma Knife. Patients who had prospective volume-staged SRS were excluded from this series. Outcomes including the rates of obliteration, hemorrhage after treatment, and adverse events were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: The mean nidus volume was 14.9 cm(3) (±3.8 cm(3)), and a mean margin dose of 20 Gy (±1.5 Gy) was applied. The mean observation period was 60 months (range, 7-178 months). The nidus obliteration rates after SRS were 44%, 76%, and 81% at 3, 5, and 6 years, respectively. The annual hemorrhage rate after SRS was 1.94% and permanent adverse events were observed in 2 patients (3%). CONCLUSIONS: For large AVMs <20 cm(3), single-stage radiosurgery by applying >16 Gy marginal dose presented favorable obliteration rates with relatively low rate of morbidity.

31369878,Targeted Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Arteriovenous Malformation Downgrading Followed by Microsurgical Resection: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.,"BACKGROUND: An unruptured brain arteriovenous malformation (bAVM) is a complex pathological entity with the potential to lead to disabling or fatal intracranial hemorrhage. The treatment approaches for these lesions have included microsurgical resection, endovascular embolization, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), and medical management or any combination of these modalities. However, the optimal treatment approach for unruptured bAVMs has not yet been determined. In the present case, we used SRS strategically to downgrade an AVM to allow for improved resectability. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 28-year-old woman had presented with 10 years of headaches and was found to have a Spetzler-Martin grade IV AVM not amenable to resection. She underwent targeted SRS only of the deep portions of the AVM, resulting in a decrease of the AVM to grade III. Subsequent microsurgical resection was successful in complete removal of the AVM. At the 1-year follow-up examination she had no deficits. CONCLUSIONS: We have proposed a protocol of using focused SRS to eliminate the portions of the AVM that confer an increased surgical risk. SRS, followed by microsurgical resection, could represent an optimal treatment strategy for high-grade AVMs with difficult surgical anatomy.",2019 Nov,2019,World neurosurgery,131,,82-86,eng,False,S1878-8750(19)32086-8;10.1016/j.wneu.2019.07.170;S1878-8750(19)32086-8;10.1016/j.wneu.2019.07.170,Case Reports;Journal Article;Review,"Adult;Angiography, Digital Subtraction;Combined Modality Therapy;Embolization, Therapeutic/*methods;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/*therapy;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Microsurgery/*methods;Neurosurgical Procedures/*methods;Radiosurgery/*methods;Severity of Illness Index",Arteriovenous malformation;Downgrade;Microsurgical;Radiosurgery;Resection;Stereotactic
27899758,Estimating the Risks of Adverse Radiation Effects After Gamma Knife Radiosurgery for Arteriovenous Malformations.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We evaluated risk factors associated with the development of adverse radiation effects (ARE) after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). METHODS: We evaluated 755 patients with AVM who underwent a single Gamma Knife SRS procedure with at least a 2-year minimum follow-up. Eighty-seven patients (12%) underwent previous resection and 128 (17%) had previous embolization. The median target volume was 3.6 mL (range, 0.1-26.3 mL). The median margin dose was 20 Gy (range, 13-27 Gy). RESULTS: Fifty-five patients (7%) developed symptomatic ARE at a median follow-up of 75 months. The cumulative rates of symptomatic ARE were 3.2%, 5.8%, 6.7%, and 7.5% at 1, 2, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Factors associated with a higher rate of developing symptomatic ARE included larger AVM volume, higher margin dose, larger 12-Gy volume, higher Spetzler-Martin grade, and higher radiosurgery-based score. The rates of developing symptomatic ARE were higher in the brain stem (22%) or thalamus (16%), compared with AVMs located in other brain locations (4%-8%). Nineteen patients (3%) sustained irreversible new neurological deficits related to ARE, and 1 patient died. The rates of irreversible symptomatic ARE were 0.8%, 1.9%, 2.1%, and 2.8% at 1, 2, 3, and 5 years, respectively. The 5-year cumulative rates of irreversible symptomatic ARE were 9.1% in thalamus, 12.1% in brain stem, and 1.4% in other locations.

37467953,Deliberately Staged Combined Endovascular Embolization and Subsequent Microsurgery Resection for the Treatment of Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformations.,"OBJECTIVE: Complex cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) require a combined therapy of endovascular embolization and microsurgical resection to eliminate the lesion and maximize neurological protection, while a deliberate time interval might contribute to optimal clinical outcomes. The present study aimed to explore the feasibility of this paradigm. METHODS: All patients who underwent deliberately planned presurgery embolization and microsurgery resection between 2015 and 2023 were reviewed, with baseline data, postoperative complications, and follow-up outcomes recorded. The modified Rankin scale (mRS) was used to evaluate clinical outcomes, with mRS 0-2 defined as good. RESULTS: A total of 30 patients were included in the study (15 were ruptured AVMs). The median Spetzler-Martin grade of baseline AVMs was 3 (interquartile range: 2-3). The median interval between the last embolization and microsurgery was 5 days (interquartile range: 2.25-7). The complete removal rate was 100%, and the overall permanent complication rate was 16.67%. At the last follow-up, 26 patients achieved mRS 0-2, while 28 had improved or unaltered mRS. The last follow-up mRS significantly improved from baseline and discharge (P = 0.0006 and P = 0.006). The last follow-up mRS decreased by 0.65 for each additional day of time interval before the 4.4-day inflection point (β = -0.65, P = 0.02) in the AVM ruptured cohort. CONCLUSIONS: The deliberately staged combined procedure of embolization and microsurgery might be a safe and efficacious strategy for Spetzler-Martin grade 2-5 AVMs, 4-5 days might be an appropriate staged time interval for ruptured AVMs, although further studies are needed to substantiate these findings.",2023 Oct,2023,World neurosurgery,178,,e254-e264,eng,False,S1878-8750(23)00972-5;10.1016/j.wneu.2023.07.040;S1878-8750(23)00972-5;10.1016/j.wneu.2023.07.040,Journal Article,"Humans;Microsurgery/methods;Treatment Outcome;Retrospective Studies;*Embolization, Therapeutic/methods;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/surgery;*Radiosurgery/methods;Rupture/surgery",AVM;Cerebral arteriovenous malformation;Combined treatment;Endovascular embolization;Microsurgical resection;Staged treatment;Time interval
20871448,Gamma knife radiosurgery for dural arteriovenous fistulas.,"BACKGROUND: The current management of intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVFs) incorporates a multimodal approach involving microneurosurgery, endovascular embolization, and radiosurgery. OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of Gamma Knife radiosurgery for dAVFs. METHODS: The series includes patients with dAVFs who had Gamma Knife radiosurgery at the University of Virginia Medical Center between 1989 and 2005 with clinical follow-up through 2008. Medical records were reviewed to obtain clinical history, demographic data, and dosimetry. Radiographic records provided the location and anatomy of the dAVFs. Follow-up angiography was performed 2 to 3 years after treatment, with cure defined as complete obliteration of fistulous flow. Follow-up for clinical symptomology and quality of life was obtained from direct patient and primary physician questionnaires. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients underwent Gamma Knife radiosurgery for dAVFs during the study period. Twenty patients (36%) presented with intracranial hemorrhage before radiosurgery. Gamma Knife radiosurgery was preceded by craniotomy for microneurosurgical ablation in 11 patients (20%) or endovascular embolization in 36 patients (65%). Follow-up angiography was performed on 46 patients (83%) with documented obliteration in 30 patients (65%). Patients lost to follow-up were classified as treatment failures, adjusting the range of efficacy from 65% to 54%. Three patients (5%) suffered a posttreatment hemorrhage during the follow-up period, but no new permanent neurological deficits resulted from these events. CONCLUSION: Gamma Knife radiosurgery is an effective adjunct therapy for dAVFs with persistence of flow after open neurosurgical resection or endovascular treatment while still maintaining a role in nonaggressive dAVFs not amenable to either surgery or embolization.",2010 Nov,2010,Neurosurgery,67,5,1230-5; discussion 1235,eng,False,10.1227/NEU.0b013e3181eff6f7;10.1227/NEU.0b013e3181eff6f7,Journal Article,Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Radiography;Radiosurgery/*methods;Treatment Outcome,

METHODS: We retrospectively (1995-2019) enrolled 39 patients with LSDAVFs who had undergone GKRS alone and evaluated their angiography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before and after GKRS. The LS conduits ipsilateral and contralateral to the DAVFs were scored using a 5-point scoring system, with scores ranging from 0 (total occlusion) to 4 (fully patent). SOR was defined by a conduit score < 2. Demographics, imaging features, and outcomes were compared between patients with and without ipsilateral SOR after GKRS. Logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate the odds ratio (OR) for obliteration with the imaging findings. RESULTS: After a median angiographic follow-up of 28 months for the 39 patients, the ipsilateral LS became more restrictive (median conduit score before and after GKRS: 2 vs. 1, p = .011). Twenty-one patients with ipsilateral SOR after GKRS had a significantly lower obliteration rate (52.4% vs. 94.4%, p = .005) than those without SOR. Follow-up SOR was independently associated with a lower obliteration rate (OR 0.05, p = .017) after adjustment for age, cortical venous reflux, and absent sinus flow void on MRI. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates a restrictive change of outflow in LSDAVFs after GKRS and a lower obliteration rate in patients with SOR.

22104394,Staged gamma knife radiosurgery for large cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"BACKGROUND: We present our experience over a 10-year period of staged radiosurgery for large arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) including patient outcomes and methods. METHODS: From July 2000 to December 2010, 80 patients with AVMs were treated with gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS) at our institution; of these patients, 5 were treated for large AVMs with staged GKS (volumes >20 cm(3)). The mean interval between treatments was 10 months (range 7-16). The mean dose for the margin used was 18.0 Gy (range 16-20). The mean volume treated was 37.2 cm(3) (range 22-50). The mean total follow-up was 76.5 months (range 42-120). RESULTS: Two patients had complete obliteration of the AVM nidus. One patient had 95% obliteration (31 months after radiosurgery), one had 90% obliteration (38 months after radiosurgery), and one had less than 50% obliteration at 53 months with a 16-month interval between staged treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Staged radiosurgery is an effective and safe method for the treatment of large AVMs. We report achieving higher marginal doses with staging in planned intervals of 6-9 months between staged treatments.

METHODS: The findings of 22 consecutive patients < or = 18 years of age who underwent radiosurgery for a single bAVM and with at least 24 months of follow-up, or earlier proven obliteration,were reviewed. The median age at radiosurgery was 13.8 years,with a hemorrhagic presentation in 86%. Median bAVM-volume was 1.8 ml, with a median prescribed marginal dose of 19.0 Gy. RESULTS: The crude complete obliteration-rate was 68% (n = 15) after a median follow-up of 24 months. The actuarial obliteration- rate was 45 % after two years and 64 % after three years. Patients with a radiosurgery-based AVM score < or = 1 more frequently had an excellent outcome than patients with a bAVM score > 1 (71% vs. 20%, P = 0.12), as well as an increased obliteration rate (P = 0.03) One patient died from a bAVM-related hemorrhage 27 months after radiosurgery, representing a postradiosurgery hemorrhage rate of 1.3%/year for the complete followup interval. Overall outcome was good to excellent in 68% (n = 15). Radiation-induced changes on MR imaging were seen in 36% (n = 8) after a median interval of 12.5 months, resulting in deterioration of pre-existing neurological symptoms in one patient. CONCLUSIONS: Radiosurgery is a relatively effective, minimally invasive treatment for small bAVMs in children. The rebleeding rate is low, provided that known predilection places for bleeding had been endovascularly eliminated.Our overall results compare unfavourably to recent pediatric microsurgical series, although comparison between series remains imprecise. Nevertheless, when treatment is indicated in a child with a bAVM that is amenable to both microsurgery or radiosurgery, microsurgery should carefully be advocated over radiosurgery, because of its immediate risk reduction.",2008 Apr,2008,Journal of neurology,255,4,551-60,eng,False,10.1007/s00415-008-0739-4;10.1007/s00415-008-0739-4,Journal Article,Adolescent;Age Factors;Brain/blood supply/physiopathology/surgery;Cerebral Angiography;Cerebral Arteries/*abnormalities/diagnostic imaging/*radiation effects;Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology/physiopathology/surgery;Child;Cohort Studies;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/pathology/physiopathology/*surgery;Male;Postoperative Hemorrhage/mortality;Radiosurgery/adverse effects/*methods/*statistics & numerical data;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome,
27334738,Stereotactic radiosurgery planning based on time-resolved CTA for arteriovenous malformation: a case report and review of the literature.,"Stereotactic radiosurgery has long been recognized as the optimal form of management for high-grade arteriovenous malformations not amenable to surgical resection. Radiosurgical plans have generally relied upon the integration of stereotactic magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), standard contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or computed tomography angiography (CTA) with biplane digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Current options are disadvantageous in that catheter-based biplane DSA is an invasive test associated with a small risk of complications and perhaps more importantly, the two-dimensional nature of DSA is an inherent limitation in creating radiosurgical contours. The necessity of multiple scans to create DSA contours for radiosurgical planning puts patients at increased risk. Furthermore, the inability to import two-dimensional plans into some radiosurgery programs, such as Cyberknife TPS, limits treatment options for patients. Defining the nidus itself is sometimes difficult in any of the traditional modalities as all draining veins and feeding arteries are included in the images. This sometimes necessitates targeting a larger volume, than strictly necessary, with stereotactic radiosurgery for treatment of the AVM. In this case report, we show the ability to use a less-invasive and three-dimensional form of angiography based on time-lapsed CTA (4D-CTA) rather than traditional DSA for radiosurgical planning. 4D-CTA may allow generation of a series of images, which can show the flow of contrast through the AVM. A review of these series may allow the surgeon to pick and use a volume set that best outlines the nidus with least interference from feeding arteries or draining veins. In addition, 4D-CTA scans can be uploaded into radiosurgery programs and allow three-dimensional targeting. This is the first reported case demonstrating the use of a 4D CTA and an MRI to delineate the AVM nidus for Gamma Knife radiosurgery, with complete obliteration of the nidus over time and subsequent management of associated radiation necrosis with bevacizumab.",2016 Aug,2016,Acta neurochirurgica,158,8,1555-62,eng,False,10.1007/s00701-016-2874-5;10.1007/s00701-016-2874-5;10.1007/s00701-016-2874-5,Case Reports;Journal Article;Review,"Adult;Angiography, Digital Subtraction;Computed Tomography Angiography;Four-Dimensional Computed Tomography;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/radiotherapy/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Angiography;Male;Radiosurgery/*methods",4D computed tomography angiography;Arteriovenous malformation;Bevacizumab;Gamma knife radiosurgery;Radiation necrosis
19934562,Gamma knife radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations located in eloquent regions of the brain.,"BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiosurgery is an effective treatment strategy for selected group of patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the obliteration rates, complications, and patient outcomes after Gamma knife radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) located in eloquent regions of the brain with an emphasis on neurological morbidity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2000 and December 2005, 37 patients with AVMs in eloquent locations (sensory, motor, speech, visual cortex, basal ganglia, and brain stem) underwent stereotactic radiosurgery. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of these patients to asses the outcomes. Of the 37 patients, only two patients had prior embolization. Three underwent prospective staged volume radiosurgery. Two patients needed redo-radiosurgery for residual AVM. Mean target volume was 9.1 cc. Three lesions had nidus volume more than 20 cc. Average marginal dose was 18.75 Gy. The median duration of follow-up was 23 months (range, 6-60 months). 15 patients had follow-up of more than 36 months. RESULTS: A total of 15 patients had follow-up of more than 36 months, thus available for evaluation of angiographic obliteration rates. Complete angiographic obliteration was documented in seven patients (46.7%). Four patients experienced hemorrhage during the latency period. One patient who had subsequent hemorrhage on follow-up developed worsening of neurological deficit. One patient developed significant sensory symptoms which resolved after steroids. No additional clinical deterioration related to treatment was noted in rest of the patients.

23140155,Radiation-induced imaging changes following Gamma Knife surgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECT: The objective of this study was to evaluate the incidence, severity, clinical manifestations, and risk factors of radiation-induced imaging changes (RIICs) following Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) for cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). METHODS: A total of 1426 GKS procedures performed for AVMs with imaging follow-up available were analyzed. Radiation-induced imaging changes were defined as newly developed increased T2 signal surrounding the treated AVM nidi. A grading system was developed to categorize the severity of RIICs. Grade I RIICs were mild imaging changes imposing no mass effect on the surrounding brain. Grade II RIICs were moderate changes causing effacement of the sulci or compression of the ventricles. Grade III RIICs were severe changes causing midline shift of the brain. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were applied to test factors potentially affecting the occurrence, severity, and associated symptoms of RIICs. RESULTS: A total of 482 nidi (33.8%) developed RIICs following GKS, with 281 classified as Grade I, 164 as Grade II, and 37 as Grade III. The median duration from GKS to the development of RIICs was 13 months (range 2-124 months). The imaging changes disappeared completely within 2-128 months (median 22 months) following the development of RIICs. The RIICs were symptomatic in 122 patients, yielding an overall incidence of symptomatic RIICs of 8.6%. Twenty-six patients (1.8%) with RIICs had permanent deficits. A negative history of prior surgery, no prior hemorrhage, large nidus, and a single draining vein were associated with a higher risk of RIICs. CONCLUSIONS: Radiation-induced imaging changes are the most common adverse effects following GKS. Fortunately, few of the RIICs are symptomatic and most of the symptoms are reversible.

34894924,Volume staged stereotactic radiosurgery and endovascular embolization in the treatment of cerebral proliferative angiopathy: lessons learned.,"Purpose of the ArticleCerebral proliferative angiopathy (CPA) is a rare and recently characterized vascular malformation that is often mistaken for a large, diffuse arteriovenous malformation (AVM). However, distinguishing the two entities is critical, as while the diseases may appear similar on imaging, they are completely different entities. The most distinguishing features of CPA compared to AVM are the presence of normal functioning brain within the 'nidus' of the abnormality and the proliferative nature of the nidus. While the management of AVM is considered well understood, the management of CPA is unclear. Typical treatment may include conservative management, targeted embolization, and/or surgical revascularization.Materials and MethodsHere, we present a patient who was initially diagnosed with a large, diffuse AVM in the posterior fossa. Initially managed conservatively, the development of progressive, debilitating neurologic symptoms prompted treatment. We pursued staged endovascular intervention and improved her initial outlook. Thereafter, volume-staged stereotactic radiosurgery (VS-SRS) was pursued to attempt to achieve a definitive treatment.Results and ConclusionsUltimately, while the treatment proved successful clinically and radiographically, the post-treatment course was exceptionally challenging. In retrospect, it is clear the working diagnosis was incorrect, and CPA was the true diagnosis. To our knowledge, this is the first known application of this treatment approach for CPA. However, the post-treatment course and final clinical outcome likely reflect the important differences between AVM and CPA. For these reasons, we are cautious to recommend the treatment course as prescribed in this case but hope to highlight important lessons learned in managing this rare condition.",2024 Oct,2024,British journal of neurosurgery,38,5,1047-1051,eng,False,10.1080/02688697.2021.2013437;10.1080/02688697.2021.2013437,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Humans;*Radiosurgery/methods;*Embolization, Therapeutic/methods;Female;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/therapy/diagnostic imaging/surgery;Treatment Outcome;Endovascular Procedures/methods;Adult;Middle Aged",AVM;CPA;Vascular malformation;endovascular;stereotactic radiosurgery
19057424,Radiosurgery facilitates resection of brain arteriovenous malformations and reduces surgical morbidity.,"OBJECTIVE: Stereotactic radiosurgery makes brain arteriovenous malformations (AVM) more manageable during their microsurgical resection. To better characterize these effects, we compared results of microsurgical resection of radiated (RS) and nonradiated (RS) AVMs to demonstrate that previous radiosurgery facilitates surgery and decreases operative morbidity. METHODS: From our series of 344 patients who underwent AVM resections at the University of California, San Francisco (1997-2007), 21 RS patients were matched with 21 RS patients based on pretreatment clinical and AVM characteristics. Matching was blinded to outcomes, which were assessed with the modified Rankin Scale. RESULTS: Mean AVM volume was reduced by 78% (P < 0.01), and Spetzler-Martin grades were reduced in 52% of RS patients (P < 0.001). Preoperative embolization was used less in RS than in RS patients (P < 0.001). Mean operative time (P < 0.01), blood loss (P < 0.05), and length of hospital stay (P < 0.05) were lower in the RS group. Surgical morbidity was 14% higher in RS patients, and they demonstrated significant worsening in modified Rankin Scale scores after surgery, whereas RS patients did not (P < 0.01). RS patients deteriorated between AVM diagnosis and surgery owing to hemorrhages during the latency period (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Previous radiosurgery facilitates AVM microsurgery and decreases operative morbidity. Radiosurgery is recommended for unruptured AVMs that are not favorable for microsurgical resection. Microsurgical resection is recommended for radiated AVMs that are not completely obliterated after the 3-year latency period but are altered favorably for surgery, even in asymptomatic patients. Prompt resection of persistent AVMs should be considered to avoid the risk of postlatency hemorrhage and to optimize patient outcomes.",2009 Feb,2009,Neurosurgery,64,2,231-8; discussion 238-40,eng,False,10.1227/01.NEU.0000338068.44060.EA;10.1227/01.NEU.0000338068.44060.EA,Controlled Clinical Trial;Journal Article,Adult;California;Combined Modality Therapy/statistics & numerical data;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*epidemiology/*surgery;Male;Microsurgery/*statistics & numerical data;Middle Aged;Prevalence;Radiosurgery/*statistics & numerical data;Treatment Outcome,
25997797,Radiosurgery for Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformations in Elderly Patients: Effect of Advanced Age on Outcomes After Intervention.,"OBJECTIVE: Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM) are infrequently diagnosed and treated in elderly patients (age, >60 years). We hypothesize that, in contrast to AVM surgical outcomes, radiosurgery outcomes are not adversely affected by increased age. The goals of this case-control study are to analyze the radiosurgery outcomes for elderly patients with AVMs and determine the effect of elderly age on AVM radiosurgery outcomes. METHODS: We evaluated a prospective database of patients with AVMs treated with radiosurgery from 1989 to 2013. Elderly patients with AVM (age, ≥ 60 years) with radiologic follow-up of ≥ 2 years or nidus obliteration were selected for analysis, and matched, in a 1:1 fashion and blinded to outcome, to adult nonelderly patients with AVM (age, <60 years). Statistical analyses were performed to determine actuarial obliteration rates and evaluate the relationship between elderly age and AVM radiosurgery outcomes. RESULTS: The matching processes yielded 66 patients in each of the elderly and nonelderly AVM cohorts. In the elderly AVM cohort, the actuarial AVM obliteration rates at 3, 5, and 10 years were 37%, 65%, and 77%, respectively; the rates of radiologically evident, symptomatic, and permanent radiation-induced changes were 36%, 11%, and 0%, respectively; the annual hemorrhage risk after radiosurgery was 1.1%, and the AVM-related mortality rate was 1.5%. Elderly age was not significantly associated with AVM obliteration, radiation-induced changes, or hemorrhage after radiosurgery. CONCLUSIONS: Advanced age does not appear to confer appreciably worse AVM radiosurgery outcomes, unlike its negative effect on AVM surgical outcomes. Thus, when an AVM warrants treatment, radiosurgery may be the preferred treatment for elderly patients.",2015 Sep,2015,World neurosurgery,84,3,795-804,eng,True,S1878-8750(15)00574-4;10.1016/j.wneu.2015.05.012;S1878-8750(15)00574-4;10.1016/j.wneu.2015.05.012,Journal Article,"Aged;Aging;Case-Control Studies;Databases, Factual;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Kaplan-Meier Estimate;Male;Middle Aged;Neurosurgical Procedures/*methods;Prospective Studies;Radiosurgery/adverse effects/*methods;Retrospective Studies;Survival Analysis;Treatment Outcome",Age groups;Elderly;Gamma knife;Intracranial arteriovenous malformations;Radiosurgery;Stroke;Vascular malformations

12069280,"Pros, cons, and current indications of open craniotomy versus gamma knife in the treatment of arteriovenous malformations and the role of endovascular embolization.","The successful treatment of an intracranial arteriovenous malformation poses both technical and conceptual problems to the neurosurgeon. Treatment decisions are made in light of current understanding of the natural history of these lesions. It is important to understand the pros, cons and current indication of open craniotomy vs. gamma knife in the treatment of arteriovenous malformations and the role of endovascular embolization. Surgical removal of an arteriovenous malformation is indicated when the operative risk is less than the morbidity and mortality associated with its natural history. The treatment goal of complete angiographic obliteration of arteriovenous malformations is achieved most effectively by microneurosurgery in low-grade lesions. Large lesions frequently require a combination of embolization and microsurgery. Although recent advances in technology and medical management have allowed previously inoperable arteriovenous malformations to be surgically excised, there is still a small group of arteriovenous malformations that cannot be excised safely due to their size and location. Stereotactic radiosurgery is clearly an important adjunct in the multimodality treatment approach for large arteriovenous malformations.

METHODS: In 1992, the authors prospectively began to stage the treatment of anatomical components to deliver higher single doses to AVMs with a volume of more than 10 cm(3). Forty-seven patients with such AVMs underwent volume-staged SRS. In this series, 18 patients (38%) had a prior hemorrhage and 21 patients (45%) underwent prior embolization. The median interval between the first-stage SRS and the second-stage SRS was 4.9 months (range 2.8-13.8 months). The median target volume was 11.5 cm(3) (range 4.0-26 cm(3)) in the first-stage SRS and 9.5 cm(3) in the second-stage SRS. The median margin dose was 16 Gy (range 13-18 Gy) for both stages. RESULTS: In 17 patients, AVM obliteration was confirmed after 2-4 SRS procedures at a median follow-up of 87 months (range 0.4-209 months). Five patients had near-total obliteration (volume reduction > 75% but residual AVM). The actuarial rates of total obliteration after 2-stage SRS were 7%, 20%, 28%, and 36% at 3, 4, 5, and 10 years, respectively. The 5-year total obliteration rate after the initial staged volumetric SRS with a margin dose of 17 Gy or more was 62% (p = 0.001). Sixteen patients underwent additional SRS at a median interval of 61 months (range 33-113 months) after the initial 2-stage SRS. The overall rates of total obliteration after staged and repeat SRS were 18%, 45%, and 56% at 5, 7, and 10 years, respectively. Ten patients sustained hemorrhage after staged SRS, and 5 of these patients died. Three of 16 patients who underwent repeat SRS sustained hemorrhage after the procedure and died. Based on Kaplan-Meier analysis (excluding the second hemorrhage in the patient who had 2 hemorrhages), the cumulative rates of AVM hemorrhage after SRS were 4.3%, 8.6%, 13.5%, and 36.0% at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years, respectively. This corresponded to annual hemorrhage risks of 4.3%, 2.3%, and 5.6% for Years 0-1, 1-5, and 5-10 after SRS. Multiple hemorrhages before SRS correlated with a significantly higher risk of hemorrhage after SRS. Symptomatic adverse radiation effects were detected in 13% of patients, but no patient died as a result of an adverse radiation effect. Delayed cyst formation did not occur in any patient after SRS. CONCLUSIONS: Prospective volume-staged SRS for large AVMs unsuitable for surgery has potential benefit but often requires more than 2 procedures to complete the obliteration process. To have a reasonable chance of benefit, the minimum margin dose should be 17 Gy or greater, depending on the AVM location. In the future, prospective volume-staged SRS followed by embolization (to reduce flow, obliterate fistulas, and occlude associated aneurysms) may improve obliteration results and further reduce the risk of hemorrhage after SRS.",2012 Jan,2012,Journal of neurosurgery,116,1,54-65,eng,False,10.3171/2011.9.JNS11177;10.3171/2011.9.JNS11177,Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Brain/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Cerebral Angiography;Child;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/instrumentation/*methods;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome,
34116503,Radiosurgery as a microsurgical adjunct: outcomes after microsurgical resection of intracranial arteriovenous malformations previously treated with stereotactic radiosurgery.,"OBJECTIVE: Microsurgical resection of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) can be aided by staged treatment consisting of stereotactic radiosurgery followed by resection in a delayed fashion. This approach is particularly useful for high Spetzler-Martin (SM) grade lesions because radiosurgery can reduce flow through the AVM, downgrade the SM rating, and induce histopathological changes that additively render the AVM more manageable for resection. The authors present their 28-year experience in managing AVMs with adjunctive radiosurgery followed by resection. METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed records of patients treated for cerebral AVMs at their institution between January 1990 and August 2019. All patients who underwent stereotactic radiosurgery (with or without embolization), followed by resection, were included in the study. Of 1245 patients, 95 met the eligibility criteria. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to assess relationships between key variables and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: The majority of lesions treated (53.9%) were high grade (SM grade IV-V), 31.5% were intermediate (SM grade III), and 16.6% were low grade (SM grade I-II). Hemorrhage was the initial presenting sign in half of all patients (49.5%). Complete resection was achieved among 84% of patients, whereas 16% had partial resection, the majority of whom received additional radiosurgery. Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores of 0-2 were achieved in 79.8% of patients, and 20.2% had poor (mRS scores 3-6) outcomes. Improved (44.8%) or stable (19%) mRS scores were observed among 63.8% of patients, whereas 36.2% had a decline in mRS scores. This includes 22 patients (23.4%) with AVM hemorrhage and 6 deaths (6.7%) outside the perioperative period but prior to AVM obliteration. CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic radiosurgery is a useful adjunct in the presurgical management of cerebral AVMs. Multimodal therapy allowed for high rates of AVM obliteration and acceptable morbidity rates, despite the predominance of high-grade lesions in this series of patients.",2022 Jan 1,2022,Journal of neurosurgery,136,1,185-196,eng,False,10.3171/2020.9.JNS201538;10.3171/2020.9.JNS201538,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Child;Child, Preschool;Combined Modality Therapy;Embolization, Therapeutic;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/mortality/*surgery;Intracranial Hemorrhages/etiology/surgery;Male;Microsurgery/*methods;Middle Aged;Neurosurgical Procedures/*methods;Radiosurgery/adverse effects/*methods;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",Spetzler-Martin grade;arteriovenous malformation;embolization;microsurgery;multimodality;stereotactic radiosurgery;vascular disorders

METHODS: Between 1987 and 2009, SRS was performed in 474 patients with SM Grade III AVMs. The AVMs were categorized by scoring the size (S), drainage (D), and location (L): IIIa was a small AVM (S1D1L1, N = 282); IIIb was a medium/deep AVM (S2D1L0, N = 44); and IIIc was a medium/eloquent AVM (S2D0L1, N = 148). The median target volume was 3.8 ml (range 0.1-26.3 ml) and the margin dose was 20 Gy (range 13-25 Gy). Eighty-one patients (17%) underwent prior embolization, and 58 (12%) underwent prior resection. RESULTS: At a mean follow-up of 89 months, the total obliteration rates documented by angiography or MRI for all SM Grade III AVMs increased from 48% at 3 years to 69% at 4 years, 72% at 5 years, and 77% at 10 years. The SM Grade IIIa AVMs were more likely to obliterate than other subgroups. The cumulative rate of hemorrhage was 2.3% at 1 year, 4.4% at 2 years, 5.5% at 3 years, 6.4% at 5 years, and 9% at 10 years. The SM Grade IIIb AVMs had a significantly higher cumulative rate of hemorrhage. Symptomatic adverse radiation effects were detected in 6%.

33264796,Does the Diffuseness of the Nidus Affect the Outcome of Stereotactic Radiosurgery in Patients with Unruptured Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformations?,"BACKGROUND: We proposed an algorithm to automate the components within the identification of components within the nidus of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) which may be used to analyze the relationship between its diffuseness and treatment outcomes following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). OBJECTIVES: to determine the impact of the diffuseness of the AVM nidus on SRS outcomes. METHODS: This study conducted regular follow-ups of 209 patients with unruptured AVMs who underwent SRS. The diffuseness of the AVM nidus was estimated by quantifying the proportions of vascular nidal component, brain parenchyma, and cerebrospinal fluid in T2-weighted MRIs. We used Cox regression analysis to characterize the association between nidal diffuseness and treatment outcomes in terms of obliteration rate and radiation-induced change (RICs) rate following SRS. RESULTS: The median AVM volume was 20.7 cm3. The median duration of imaging follow-up was 51 months after SRS. The overall AVM obliteration rate was 68.4%. RICs were identified in 156 of the 209 patients (74.6%). The median proportions of the nidus of AVM and brain parenchyma components within the prescription isodose range were 30.2 and 52.2%, respectively. Cox regression multivariate analysis revealed that the only factor associated with AVM obliteration rate after SRS was AVM volume. However, a larger AVM volume (>20 mL) and a larger proportion of brain parenchyma (>50%) within the prescription isodose range were both correlated with a higher RIC rate following SRS.

19344220,Early results of CyberKnife radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECT: The authors describe a method that utilizes an image-guided robotic radiosurgical apparatus (the CyberKnife) for treatment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). This procedure required the development of an original technique that allows a high degree of automation. METHODS: Angiographic images were imported into the treatment planning software by coregistering CT and 3D rotational angiography. The nidus contour was delineated using the contouring tools of the treatment planning system. Functional MR imaging was employed for contouring critical cortical regions, such as the motor cortex and language areas. Once the radiation dose to be delivered to the target volume and dose constraints to critical structures were prescribed, the inverse treatment planning function determined the optimal treatment plan. RESULTS: A series of 279 patients with cerebral AVMs underwent CyberKnife radiosurgery. One transitory adverse effect of the radiation procedure was observed. Eight bleeding occurrences were noted before complete AVM obliteration. Of the 102 patients with follow-up > 36 months, 80 underwent angiographic evaluation. In this group, 65 patients (81.2%) showed complete angiographic obliteration of their AVM. In 8 more patients, complete angiographic obliteration was demonstrated by MR angiography only. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report describing a technique developed for CyberKnife radiosurgery of cerebral AVMs. The use of different imaging modalities for automatic delineation of the target and critical structures combined with the employment of the inverse treatment planning capability is the crucial point of the procedure.

31558656,Evaluation of the radiosurgical treatment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations: a retrospective single-center analysis of three decades.,"BACKGROUND: Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) in the treatment of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is still controversially discussed. OBJECTIVE: To present long-term follow-up data on patients after Gamma Knife radiosurgery for cerebral AVMs. METHODS: Overall, 516 patients received radiosurgery for cerebral AVMs between 1992 and 2018 at our department, of whom 265 received radiosurgery alone and 207 were treated with a combined endovascular-radiosurgical approach. Moreover, 45 patients were treated with a volume-staged approach. Two eras were analyzed, the pre-modern era between 1992 and 2002 and the modern era thereafter. RESULTS: In GKRS-only treated patients, median time to nidus occlusion was 3.8 years. Spetzler-Ponce (SP) class was a significant predictor for time to obliteration in the whole sample. Median time to obliteration for the combined treatment group was 6.5 years. Patients in the pre-modern era had a significantly higher obliteration rate than those treated in the modern era. Overall, the calculated yearly hemorrhage risk in the observation period after first GKRS was 1.3%. Permanent post-radiosurgical complications occurred in 4.9% of cases but did not differ between the treatment groups or treatment eras. The obliteration rate was significantly lower and the hemorrhage rate was higher in volume-staged treated patients than in conventionally treated patients. CONCLUSION: GKRS is an effective treatment option for SP class A and B cerebral AVMs. After combined endovascular-radiosurgical treatment, the outcome of selected SP class C AVMs aligns with that of SP class B lesions.

19796884,Complications following linear accelerator based stereotactic radiation for cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"PURPOSE: Primarily, gamma knife centers are predominant in publishing results on arteriovenous malformations (AVM) treatments including reports on risk profile. However, many patients are treated using a linear accelerator-most of these at smaller centers. Because this setting is different from a large gamma knife center, the risk profile at Linac departments could be different from the reported experience. Prescribed radiation doses are dependent on AVM volume. This study details results from a medium sized Linac department center focusing on risk profiles. METHOD AND MATERIALS: A database was searched for all patients with AVMs. We included 50 consecutive patients with a minimum of 24 months follow-up (24-51 months). RESULTS: AVM occlusion was verified in 78% of patients (39/50). AVM occlusion without new deficits (excellent outcome) was obtained in 44%. Good or fair outcome (AVM occlusion with mild or moderate new deficits) was seen in 30%. Severe complications after AVM occlusion occurred in 4% with a median interval of 15 months after treatment (range, 1-26 months). CONCLUSIONS: We applied an AVM grading score developed at the Mayo Clinic to predict probable outcome after radiosurgery in a large patient population treated with Gamma knife. A cutoff above and below a score of 1.5 could not discriminate between the likelihood of having an excellent outcome (approximately 45%). The chance of having an excellent or good outcome was slightly higher in patients with an AVM score below 1.5 (64% vs. 57%).",2010 Jun 1,2010,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",77,2,542-7,eng,True,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2009.05.048;S0360-3016(09)00831-1;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2009.05.048,Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Child;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Particle Accelerators;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects/instrumentation/methods;Radiotherapy Dosage;Risk Factors;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult,
20362350,Clinical outcome after repeated radiosurgery for brain arteriovenous malformations.,"INTRODUCTION: We assessed the clinical and radiological outcome after repeated radiosurgery for brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) after failure of initial radiosurgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients underwent repeated radiosurgery. The mean bAVM volume at first radiosurgery (S1) was 4.6 +/- 4.3 ml and that at second radiosurgery (S2) was 2.1 +/- 2.5 ml. The median marginal dose was 18 Gy at S1, and 21 Gy at S2. Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) score was determined in all patients at last follow-up (FU). RESULTS: Complete obliteration was reached in nine patients (60%). Median time to obliteration was 50 months after S2. An excellent outcome (no new neurologic deficiencies, complete obliteration) was reached in seven patients (47%). Eleven patients (73%) showed a MRS1. Radiation-induced complications occurred in 20%, of which 13% occurred after S2. Radiological complications included cyst formation (n = 1), radiation-related edema (n = 4), and radiation necrosis (n = 1), resulting in an increasing mean MRS of 0.5 at S1, 0.6 at S2, to 0.8 at FU. No (re-)bleedings were encountered during 137-patient years at risk. DISCUSSION: Repeated radiosurgery is a viable option for the treatment of small remnant bAVMs. We report 20% permanent radiation-induced complications.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1984 and 2000, we used Linac radiosurgery to treat 792 patients with cAVM. This series included 57 children (7.2%) under the age of 15 years at the time of RS (range = 7-15 years, median = 12 years). We were able to evaluate 49 of the children (86%) by angiography, 21 boys and 28 girls (sex ratio = 0.75). First symptoms were: hemorrhage, 34 patients (69.4%); seizures, 6 patients (12.5%); headache, 6 patients (12.5%); and progressive neurologic deficit, 1 patient (2.1%). Nidus size ranged from 5 to 50 mm (median = 20 mm). Nidus volume ranged from 0.6 to 16 cc (median = 3.5 cc). Patient distribution according to Spetzler-Martin grade was as follows: Grade 1, n = 5 (11%); Grade 2, n = 18 (35%); Grade 3, n = 21 (40%,); Grade 4, n = 5 (14%); and Grade 5, n = 0%. Twenty-seven patients (55.1%) had other treatment before RS: embolization, n = 14 (31.1%); neurosurgery, n = 9 (20.5%); embolization and neurosurgery, n = 3 (6.1%). RS was performed with the system used for adults. Patients were seated in a Betti armchair. Circular 15 MV X-ray minibeams (6 to 20 mm) were delivered in coronal arcs by a GECGR Saturne 43 Linac. Planification and dosimetry were carried out using the Associated Target Methodology and Dosigray TPS dosimetric systems. The dose at the peripheral isodose (50-70%) ranged from 18 to 28 Gy. Median and mean doses were 25 Gy and 23.8 Gy. Mono-isocentric planification was used in 25 patients (53.2%) and multi-isocentric in 24 patients (2 to 5 isocenters). The overall follow-up ranged from 7 to 172 months (mean 40 months, median 34 months). RESULTS: The overall rate of obliteration (OR) was 30/49 (61.2%). Mean time to obliteration was 34 months (range = 7 to 172 months). OR varied according to nidus size and volume: OR was 80% for nidus <15 mm, 67% for nidus between 15 and 25 mm, and 42% for nidus >25 mm (p = 0.058). OR was 100% for nidus <1 cc, 73% for nidus between 1 and 4 cc, and 40% for nidus of 4 to 10 cc (p = 0.019). OR according to patient gender was 84.2% for boys and 40% for girls. OR according to minimum dose (Dmin) was 44% for Dmin < 15 Gy (p = 0.01), 89% for D min from 15 to 20 Gy, and 100% for Dmin > 20 Gy (p = 0.01). OR was 62% in nonembolized AVM and 58% in previously embolized AVM (NS). OR according to the number of isocenters was 68.2%, 55.6%, 80%, 50%, and 0% for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 isocenters, respectively. After multivariate analysis, only Dmin closely correlated with OR (beta = 0.462; SE = 0.244, p = 0.057). Of the 6 patients with seizures before RS, 5 (80%) were seizure-free without medication after RS. One patient died of pneumonia. MORBIDITY: Four patients (8.2%) had bleeding after RS at 39, 45, 51, and 59 months. No new neurologic deficit was found during the follow-up period. Twenty-nine patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging. Thirteen patients (44.8%) showed no parenchymal changes. Thirteen patients (44.8%) had Grade 2 changes, that is, T2 hypersignals. Two patients (6.9%) had Grade 3 changes, and 1 patient (3.4%) had Grade 4 ""necrosis-like"" changes.

20568667,Repeat γ knife surgery for incompletely obliterated cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVE: The causes of failure after an initial Gamma procedure were studied, along with imaging and clinical outcomes, in a series of 140 patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) treated with repeat Gamma Knife surgery (GKS). METHODS: Causes of initial treatment failure included inaccurate nidus definition in 14 patients, failure to fill part of the nidus as a result of hemodynamic factors in 16, recanalization of embolized AVM compartments in 6, and suboptimal dose (<20 Gy) in 23. Nineteen patients had repeat GKS for subtotal obliteration of AVMs. In 62 patients, the AVM failed to obliterate despite correct target definition and adequate dose. At the time of retreatment, the nidus volume ranged from 0.1 to 6.9 cm3 (mean, 1.4 cm3), and the mean prescription dose was 20.3 Gy. RESULTS: Repeat GKS yielded a total angiographic obliteration in 77 patients (55%) and subtotal obliteration in 9 (6.4%). In 38 patients (27.1%), the AVMs remained patent, and in 16 patients (11.4%), no flow voids were observed on magnetic resonance imaging. Clinically, 126 patients improved or remained stable, and 14 experienced deterioration (8 resulting from a rebleed, 2 caused by persistent arteriovenous shunting, and 4 related to radiation-induced changes). CONCLUSION: By using repeat GKS, we achieved a 55% angiographic cure rate. Although radiation-induced changes as visualized on magnetic resonance imaging occurred in 48 patients (39%), only 4 patients (3.6%) developed permanent neurological deficits. These findings may be useful in deciding the management of AVMs in whom total obliteration after initial GKS was not achieved.",2010 Jul,2010,Neurosurgery,67,1,55-64; discussion 64,eng,True,10.1227/01.neu.0000370204.68711.ac,Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Child;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/pathology/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Postoperative Complications/*etiology/*physiopathology/surgery;Radiography;Radiosurgery/adverse effects/*methods;Reoperation/methods/trends;Young Adult,
29288850,"Angiographic ""Blush"" After Stereotactic Radiosurgery Ablation of Residual Arteriovenous Malformation in Pediatric Patient: Case Report and Review of Literature.","INTRODUCTION: While surgical resection remains a primary treatment for accessible arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has become thoroughly integrated into the AVM armamentarium; however, delayed sequelae of this treatment have become evident with increased long-term follow-up. To our knowledge, this is the second case of an aberrant local arterial angiographic blush without early venous drainage or an associated lesion following AVM SRS. CASE DESCRIPTION: An 8-year-old female presented with a ruptured 4-cm right medial frontal periventricular Spetzler-Martin grade 3 AVM with isolated intraventricular hemorrhage. She underwent subtotal resection followed by SRS. Six years later, diagnostic cerebral angiography demonstrated a prominent arterial-phase filling microvasculature without early venous drainage in the region of the irradiated residual AVM nidus. CONCLUSION: Although there is a paucity of information on angiographic blush following AVM SRS, consensus in the literature suggests that without early venous drainage, these lesions appear to pose an insignificant threat to the patient. These angiographic findings may be on a spectrum of delayed cerebrovascular radiation changes, and thus indefinite follow-up may be considered, especially in pediatric patients.",2018 Mar,2018,World neurosurgery,111,,235-239,eng,False,S1878-8750(17)32225-8;10.1016/j.wneu.2017.12.109;S1878-8750(17)32225-8;10.1016/j.wneu.2017.12.109,Case Reports;Journal Article;Review,Brain/*diagnostic imaging;Cerebral Angiography;Child;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Radiosurgery,Arterial blush;Arteriovenous malformation;Cerebral angiography;Stereotactic radiosurgery
16736728,Radiosurgical retreatment for brain arteriovenous malformation.,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze our experience with a second radiosurgical treatment for brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVMs) after an unsuccessful first radiosurgical treatment. METHODS: Between 1993 and 2000, 242 patients were treated by the Toronto Sunnybrook Regional Cancer Center using a LINAC system. Fifteen of these patients required a second radiosurgical intervention due to the failure of the first procedure. Data was collected on baseline patient characteristics, BAVM features, radiosurgery treatment plan and outcomes. Brain arteriovenous malformation obliteration was determined by follow-up MRI and angiography and the obliteration prediction index (OPI) calculated according to a previously established formula. RESULTS: The median interval between the first and second treatment was 46 months (range 39-109). The median follow-up after the second procedure was 39 months (range 26 to 72). The mean BAVM volume before the first treatment was 8.9cm3 (range 0.3-21) and before the second treatment was 3.6cm3 (range 0.2-11.6). The mean marginal dose during the first treatment was 18Gy (range 12-25) and during the second treatment was 16Gy (range 12-20). After the second treatment, nine patients had obliteration of their BAVM confirmed by angiography and one patient had obliteration confirmed by MRI, resulting in an obliteration rate of 66.6%, which is very comparable to that predicted by the OPI (65%). After the second treatment two patients had a radiation-induced complication (13.3%). CONCLUSION: Retreatment of BAVM using a second radiosurgery procedure is a safe and effective option that offers the same rate of success as the initial radiosurgery and an acceptable risk of radiation-induced complication.",2006 May,2006,The Canadian journal of neurological sciences.

22077445,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations, Part 3: outcome predictors and risks after repeat radiosurgery.","OBJECT: The object of this study was to evaluate the outcomes and risks of repeat stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for incompletely obliterated cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). METHODS: Between 1987 and 2006, Gamma Knife surgery was performed in 996 patients with AVMs. During this period, repeat SRS was performed in 105 patients who had incompletely obliterated AVMs at a median of 40.9 months after initial SRS (range 27.5-139 months). The median AVM target volume was 6.4 cm(3) (range 0.2-26.3 cm(3)) at initial SRS but was reduced to 2.3 cm(3) (range 0.1-18.2 cm(3)) at the time of the second procedure. The median margin dose at both initial SRS and repeat SRS was 18 Gy. RESULTS: The actuarial rate of total obliteration by angiography or MR imaging after repeat SRS was 35%, 68%, 77%, and 80% at 3, 4, 5, and 10 years, respectively. The median time to complete angiographic or MR imaging obliteration after repeat SRS was 39 months. Factors associated with a higher rate of AVM obliteration were smaller residual AVM target volume (p = 0.038) and a volume reduction of 50% or more after the initial procedure (p = 0.014). Seven patients (7%) had a hemorrhage in the interval between initial SRS and repeat SRS. Seventeen patients (16%) had hemorrhage after repeat SRS and 6 patients died. The cumulative actuarial rates of new AVM hemorrhage after repeat SRS were 1.9%, 8.1%, 10.1%, 10.1%, and 22.4% at 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 years, respectively, which translate to annual hemorrhage rates of 4.05% and 1.79% of patients developing new post-repeat-SRS hemorrhages per year for Years 0-2 and 2-10 following repeat SRS. Factors associated with a higher risk of hemorrhage after repeat SRS were a greater number of prior hemorrhages (p = 0.008), larger AVM target volume at initial SRS (p = 0.010), larger target volume at repeat SRS (p = 0.002), initial AVM volume reduction less than 50% (p = 0.019), and a higher Pollock-Flickinger score (p = 0.010). Symptomatic adverse radiation effects developed in 5 patients (4.8%) after initial SRS and in 10 patients (9.5%) after repeat SRS. Prior embolization (p = 0.022) and a higher Spetzler-Martin grade (p = 0.004) were significantly associated with higher rates of adverse radiation effects after repeat SRS. Delayed cyst formation occurred in 5 patients (4.8%) at a median of 108 months after repeat SRS (range 47-184 months). CONCLUSIONS: Repeat SRS for incompletely obliterated AVMs increases the eventual obliteration rate. Hemorrhage after obliteration did not occur in this series. The best results for patients with incompletely obliterated AVMs were seen in patients with a smaller residual nidus volume and no prior hemorrhages.",2012 Jan,2012,Journal of neurosurgery,116,1,21-32,eng,True,10.3171/2011.9.JNS101741;10.3171/2011.9.JNS101741,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Brain/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Cerebral Angiography;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/adverse effects/*instrumentation;Reoperation;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome",
18797353,Modification of the radiosurgery-based arteriovenous malformation grading system.,"OBJECTIVE: The radiosurgery-based arteriovenous malformation (AVM) grading scale was developed to predict patient outcomes after radiosurgery. The purpose of this study was to determine whether simplifying this grading system using location as a two-tiered variable detracted from the accuracy of the scale. METHODS: Regression analysis modeling on 220 patients who underwent AVM radiosurgery between 1987 and 1992 at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center using location as a two-tiered variable resulted in the following equation: AVM score = (0.1) (volume, mL) + (0.02) (age, yr) + (0.3) (location, hemispheric/corpus callosum/cerebellar = 0; basal ganglia/thalamus/brainstem = 1). Testing of the modified grading system was performed on 247 patients who underwent AVM radiosurgery between 1990 and 2001 at the Mayo Clinic. The mean modified AVM score was 1.62. The mean duration of patient follow-up was 70 months. RESULTS: There was no difference between the original and modified radiosurgery-based AVM scale with regard to AVM obliteration without new neurological deficits (F = 0.92, P = 0.53) or decline in Modified Rankin Scale (F = 0.83, P = 0.56) after radiosurgery. The modified radiosurgery-based AVM scale correlated with the percentage of patients with AVM obliteration without new deficits (<or=1.00, 89%; 1.01-1.50, 70%; 1.51-2.00, 64%; >or=2.00, 46%) (r = -0.98, P < 0.01) and a decline in Modified Rankin Scale (<or=1.00, 0%; 1.01-1.50, 13%; 1.51-2.00, 20%; >2.00, 36%) (r = 0.99, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Simplifying the radiosurgery-based AVM grading system using location as a two-tiered variable did not detract from the accuracy of the scale. This system has been validated by numerous centers performing both gamma knife- and linear accelerator-based procedures and should be used in future studies on AVM radiosurgery to stratify patients for more accurate comparative analyses.",2008 Aug,2008,Neurosurgery,63,2,239-43; discussion 243,eng,False,10.1227/01.NEU.0000315861.24920.92;00006123-200808000-00014;10.1227/01.NEU.0000315861.24920.92,Comparative Study;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Child;Cohort Studies;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*pathology/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/methods/*standards;*Severity of Illness Index",
17621031,An arteriovenous malformation model for stereotactic radiosurgery research.,"OBJECTIVE: To introduce the utilization of a swine arteriovenous malformation (AVM) model for stereotactic radiosurgery research and to describe the morphological changes in the vessels after radiation. METHODS: The model was created in six animals by creation of a right-sided carotid-jugular fistula. Pre- and postsurgical hemodynamic evaluation was performed. The left rete was radiated in four animals; two animals were not radiated. All animals were sacrificed 4 months after surgery, and the bilateral retia were obtained at autopsy. RESULTS: There were no procedure-related complications. A pressure gradient of 20 mmHg across the nidus was obtained after surgery. The peak velocity in the arterial feeder increased from 18.5 to 83 cm/s. Microscopic examination of the control animals showed intimal hyperplasia and disrupted internal elastic lamina, similar to human AVMs. The radiated retia showed more prominent intimal hyperplasia. This was confirmed by histometric studies showing greater luminal occlusion in radiated specimens. Adventitial fibrosis was prominent in the radiated retia and was absent in the control animals. Immunohistochemical studies showed proliferating smooth muscle cells in the intima. The adventitial fibrosis consisted of smooth muscle cells surrounded by collagen Type IV extracellular matrix. CONCLUSION: The nidus component and high-flow vasculopathy make this an attractive model for stereotactic radiosurgery research. Histology of the radiated models is similar to those described in radiated human AVMs. Further studies of the model are warranted to gain a better understanding of the cellular and molecular events in AVM vessels after stereotactic radiosurgery.",2007 Jul,2007,Neurosurgery,61,1,152-9; discussion 159,eng,False,00006123-200707000-00018;10.1227/01.neu.0000279736.07683.1e,"Evaluation Study;Journal Article;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural","Animals;Biomedical Research/*methods;*Disease Models, Animal;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Male;Radiography;Radiosurgery/*methods;Swine",
15850901,Stereotactic proton beam therapy for intracranial arteriovenous malformations.,"PURPOSE: To investigate hypofractionated stereotactic proton therapy of predominantly large intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) by analyzing retrospectively the results from a cohort of patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Since 1993, a total of 85 patients with vascular lesions have been treated. Of those, 64 patients fulfilled the criteria of having an arteriovenous malformation and sufficient follow-up. The AVMs were grouped by volume: <14 cc (26 patients) and > or =14 cc (38 patients). Treatment was delivered with a fixed horizontal 200 MeV proton beam under stereotactic conditions, using a stereophotogrammetric positioning system. The majority of patients were hypofractionated (2 or 3 fractions), and the proton doses are presented as single-fraction equivalent cobalt Gray equivalent doses (SFEcGyE). The overall mean minimum target volume dose was 17.37 SFEcGyE, ranging from 10.38-22.05 SFEcGyE. RESULTS: Analysis by volume group showed obliteration in 67% for volumes <14 cc and 43% for volumes > or =14 cc. Grade IV acute complications were observed in 3% of patients. Transient delayed effects were seen in 15 patients (23%), becoming permanent in 3 patients. One patient also developed a cyst 8 years after therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic proton beam therapy applied in a hypofractionated schedule allows for the safe treatment of large AVMs, with acceptable results. It is an alternative to other treatment strategies for large AVMs. AVMs are likely not static entities, but probably undergo vascular remodeling. Factors influencing angiogenesis could play a new role in a form of adjuvant therapy to improve on the radiosurgical results.",2005 May 1,2005,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",62,1,44-52,eng,False,S0360-3016(04)02567-2;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2004.09.008,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Child;Dose Fractionation, Radiation;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;*Proton Therapy;Radiosurgery/adverse effects/*methods;Retrospective Studies",

33293642,"Radiosurgery for unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations in the pre-ARUBA era: long-term obliteration rate, risk of hemorrhage and functional outcomes.","The management of non-hemorrhagic arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) remains a subject of debate, even more since the ARUBA trial. Here, we report the obliteration rate, the risk of hemorrhage and the functional outcomes after Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) as first-line treatment for non-hemorrhagic AVMs treated before the ARUBA publication, in a reference university center with multimodal AVM treatments available. We retrospectively analyzed data from a continuous series of 172 patients harboring unruptured AVMs treated by GKRS as first-line treatment in our Lille University Hospital, France, between April 2004 and December 2013. The primary outcome was obliteration rate. Secondary outcomes were the hemorrhage rate, the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), morbidity and epilepsy control at last follow-up. The minimal follow-up period was of 3 years. Median age at presentation was 40 years (IQR 28; 51). Median follow-up was 8.8 years (IQR 6.8; 11.3). Median target volume was 1.9 cm(3) (IQR 0.8-3.3 cm(3)), median Spetzler-Martin grade: 2 (IQR 1-2), median Pollock-Flickinger score: 1.07 (IQR 0.82-2.94), median Virginia score: 1 (IQR 1-2). Median treatment dose was 24 Gy at 50% isodose line. Twenty-three patients underwent a second GKRS after a median time of 58 months after first GKRS. The overall obliteration rate was of 76%, based primarily on cerebral angiography and/or rarely only upon MRI. Hemorrhage during the post-treatment follow-up was reported in 18 (10%) patients (annual risk of 1.1%). Transient post-GKRS morbidity was reported in 14 cases (8%) and persistent neurological deficit in 8 (4.6%) of patients. At last follow-up, 86% of patients had a mRS ≤ 1. Concerning patients with pretherapeutic epilepsy, 84.6% of them were seizure-free at last follow-up. GKRS as first-line therapeutic option for unruptured cerebral AVMs achieves high obliteration rates (76%) while maintaining a high-level patient's autonomy. All hemorrhagic events occurred during the first 4 years after the initial GKRS. In cases with epilepsy, there was 84.6% seizure free at last follow-up.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 127 patients were treated between 1990 and 2008 by use of linear accelerator or Gamma Knife. Their median age was 37 years, the median AVM volume was 7.3 cc (range, 0.014-113.13 cc), and the median follow-up duration was 42 months (range, 6-209 months). Forty-two percent of patients presented with intracranial hemorrhage, 31% received embolization, and 8% underwent prior resection. Thirty-one percent of patients received more than one round of radiosurgery. RESULTS: 64% of patients had complete obliteration confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging or angiography. Positive predictors of obliteration included pretreatment hemorrhage (p = 0.042), smaller AVM volume (odds ratio = 1.25; 95% CI, 1.03-1.52), and larger marginal dose (odds ratio = 0.292; 95% CI, 0.100-0.820), whereas embolization (p < 0.001) was a negative predictor . The annual risk of hemorrhage after radiosurgery was 2.2%, and the risk of death as a result of hemorrhage was 0.6-1.3%. Eleven percent of patients reported new or worsened neurologic symptoms. Radiosurgery was effective in treating AVM-related headaches (p < 0.001) but did not improve the performance status of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic radiosurgery is an effective tool in the treatment of AVMs and amelioration of AVM-related headaches, but it did not affect the patients' performance status.

25827867,Hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy in medium-sized to large arteriovenous malformations.,"We have reviewed treatment results in terms of obliteration and complications in 24 patients with medium to large sized cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) (mean volume 18.5±8.9cm(3); range: 10-42) treated with hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT). AVMs are congenital lesions associated with a high morbidity and mortality. Radiosurgery is one option for treatment. However, in larger AVMs with volumes exceeding 10cm(3) obliteration rates are less favourable and radiation induced complications more frequent. For larger AVMs, volume-staged radiosurgery is one option while another option may be the use of HSRT. Patients were treated with 6-7Gy in five fractions to a total dose of 30-35Gy (mean total dose 32.9±1.6Gy [standard error of the mean]). Sixteen patients (69.6%) showed obliteration after a mean time of 35.2±14.8 months (range: 24-60). Only one patient (4.2%) experienced symptomatic radionecrosis. Our treatment with HSRT seems safe and efficient for treatment of medium to large sized AVMs. Treatment results seem to be in line with volume-staged radiosurgery and may be an alternative for AVMs not suitable for single fraction radiosurgery.",2015 Jun,2015,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society,22,6,955-8,eng,False,S0967-5868(15)00063-6;10.1016/j.jocn.2014.12.015;S0967-5868(15)00063-6;10.1016/j.jocn.2014.12.015,Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnosis/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;*Radiation Dose Hypofractionation;Radiation Injuries/prevention & control;Radiosurgery/*methods/trends;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult,Arteriovenous malformations;Linear accelerator;Radiosurgery;Treatment results
11013105,Embolisation of cerebral arteriovenous malformations to assure successful subsequent radiosurgery.,"This study investigated the angiographic changes in embolised arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) pre- and post-embolisation and preradiosurgery to clarify the usefulness of embolisation as a pretreatment for radiosurgery and the strategy of embolisation for the radiosurgical success. A total of 37 patients with cerebral AVMs treated over a period of 4 years was investigated. All the AVMs were embolised with N-butyl cyanoacrylate and 2 months later they were treated by radiosurgery. The size of AVM nidus reduced just following the embolisation (mean 21.9 ml to 3.9 ml). The angiogram taken in preparation for radiosurgery showed a further size reduction in the nidus of 16 AVMs, no change in 10 and regrowth in 11. In all the cases where size was reduced, the nidus was densely packed, while all the regrown AVMs were of the diffuse type. Five AVMs disappeared following radiosurgery, all of which were size-reduction or no-change cases. In conclusion, to achieve success in subsequent radiosurgery, nidus embolisation and the occlusion of fistulous and meningeal feeders are mandatory. Imprudent proximal feeder occlusion and the use of embolic materials with a risk of recanalisation should be avoided to prevent regrowth of the nidus, which may lead to errors in planning the radiosurgery to follow.",2000 Sep,2000,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society,7 Suppl 1,,82-5,eng,False,S0967586800907185;10.1054/jocn.2000.0718,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Combined Modality Therapy;*Embolization, Therapeutic/methods;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/surgery/*therapy;Male;Middle Aged;*Radiosurgery/methods",
11316556,Stereotactic radiosurgery in the management of angiographically occult vascular malformations.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the role of stereotactic radiosurgery in the treatment of angiographically occult vascular malformations (AOVMs). METHODS AND MATERIALS: From 1987 to 1996, 21 patients, 10 males and 11 females, median age of 41 years (range: 7-75 years), with an intracerebral AOVM underwent stereotactic radiosurgery at our institution. All were considered at high risk for surgical intervention. The vascular lesions were located in the brainstem (17 patients), basal ganglia (2), occipital lobe (1), and cerebellum (1). Diagnosis was based on high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Clinical presentation at onset included previous intracerebral hemorrhage (20 patients) and epilepsy (1). All patients were treated with a linac-based radiosurgical technique. The median dose delivered was 25 Gy (range 13-50 Gy), typically prescribed to the 80-90% isodose surface (range 50-90%), which corresponded to the periphery of the vascular malformation. Patients were followed by clinical neurologic assessment and by MRI on a regular interval basis. RESULTS: Follow-up was obtained in 20 patients; clinical or MRI information was not available for 1 patient, and this patient was excluded from our analysis. At a median follow-up of 77 months (range: 4-141 months), follow-up MRIs postradiosurgery do not demonstrate any changes in the appearance of the AOVM. Four patients developed an intracranial bleed at 4, 8, 35, and 57 months postradiosurgery. Annual hemorrhage rates were considerably higher in the observation period preradiosurgery than postradiosurgery (30% vs. 3.2%, p < 0.001). Complications postradiosurgery were observed in 4 patients. Three patients developed mild to moderate edema surrounding the radiosurgical target, expressed at 5, 8, and 24 months, respectively. In all cases, the edema was transient and resolved completely on subsequent MRIs. One of the 4 patients developed radiation necrosis 8 months after radiosurgery. CONCLUSION: The use of stereotactic radiosurgery in the treatment of AOVM continues to be controversial. Our results appear to show a reduction in the risk of symptomatic hemorrhage post treatment. Patients with previous history of hemorrhage or progressive neurologic deficit and small, well circumscribed lesions may benefit from a trial of stereotactic radiosurgery.",2001 May 1,2001,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",50,1,133-8,eng,False,S0360-3016(00)01568-6;10.1016/s0360-3016(00)01568-6,Clinical Trial;Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Child;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/adverse effects/*methods;Treatment Outcome,
28871374,Clinical outcomes and radiosurgical considerations for pediatric arteriovenous malformation: influence of clinical features on obliteration rate.,"PURPOSE: Gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) is an established treatment modality for brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM), but there have been few published studies examining the relationship between clinical features of AVM and successful obliteration with GKRS in pediatric patients. In the current study, we investigate the outcomes of GKRS for pediatric patients with brain AVM and analyze the variables that influence obliteration. METHODS: We analyzed 68 pediatric patients (≤ 18 years) with a mean follow-up period of 61.9 months (range 6-215 months). The following parameters were analyzed to determine their influence on obliteration of AVM treated by GKRS: age, sex, target volume, irradiation dose, prior treatment, location of AVM, nidus structure, velocity of AVM, location of venous drainage, number of feeding arteries, and initial presenting symptoms. Also, we estimated clinical factors which should be considered during the follow-up period. RESULTS: Of the 68 patients, complete obliteration was confirmed in 26 (38.2%) by cerebral angiography. The response rate of AVM for GKRS was 92.6%. No significant association was observed between any of the parameters investigated and the obliteration of AVM, with the exception of number of feeding arteries, which exhibited a statistically significant difference by univariate analysis (p = 0.003). However, on multivariate analysis, nidus structure (p = 0.007), velocity of the main arterial phase (p = 0.013), velocity of the feeding artery phase (p = 0.004), and the number of feeding arteries (p = 0.018) showed statistical significance. CONCLUSION: GKRS yielded good long-term clinical outcomes in most pediatric patients. Multiple arterial feeding vessels, diffuse nidus structure, and fast flow of AVM were specific factors associated with a low rate of obliteration in pediatric AVMs.",2017 Dec,2017,Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for,33,12,2137-2145,eng,False,10.1007/s00381-017-3579-7;10.1007/s00381-017-3579-7;10.1007/s00381-017-3579-7,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Arteriovenous Fistula/*diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Male;Radiosurgery/methods/*trends;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",Arteriovenous malformation;Cerebral angiography;Gamma knife radiosurgery;Pediatrics
25909572,A quantitative analysis of adverse radiation effects following Gamma Knife radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECT: The authors review outcomes following Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and their correlation to postradiosurgery adverse radiation effects (AREs). METHODS: From a prospective institutional review board-approved database, the authors identified patients with a minimum of 2 years of follow-up and thin-slice T2-weighted MRI sequences for volumetric analysis. A total of 105 AVM patients were included. The authors analyzed the incidence and quantitative changes in AREs as a function of time after GKRS. Statistical analysis was performed to identify factors related to ARE development and changes in the ARE index. RESULTS: The median clinical follow-up was 53.8 months (range 24-212.4 months), and the median MRI follow-up was 36.8 months (range 24-212.4 months). 47.6% of patients had an AVM with a Spetzler-Martin grade ≥ III. The median administered margin and maximum doses were 22 and 40 Gy, respectively. The overall obliteration rate was 70.5%. Of patients who showed complete obliteration, 74.4% developed AREs within 4-6 months after GKRS. Late-onset AREs (i.e., > 12 months) correlated to a failure to obliterate the nidus. 58.1% of patients who developed appreciable AREs (defined as ARE index > 8) proceeded to have a complete nidus obliteration. Appreciable AREs were found to be influenced by AVM nidus volume > 3 ml, lobar location, number of draining veins and feeding arteries, prior embolization, and higher margin dose. On the other hand, a minimum ARE index > 8 predicted obliteration (p = 0.043). CONCLUSIONS: ARE development after radiosurgery follows a temporal pattern peaking at 7-12 months after stereotactic radiosurgery. The ARE index serves as an important adjunct tool in patient follow-up and outcome prediction.",2015 Oct,2015,Journal of neurosurgery,123,4,945-53,eng,True,10.3171/2014.10.JNS142264;10.3171/2014.10.JNS142264,Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Postoperative Complications/epidemiology/etiology;Prospective Studies;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects;Young Adult,ARE = adverse radiation effect;AVM = arteriovenous malformation;GKRS = Gamma Knife radiosurgery;Gamma Knife;SRS = stereotactic radiosurgery;T2 changes;VRAS = Virginia Radiosurgery AVM Scale;arteriovenous malformation;complication;outcome;radiosurgery;stereotactic radiosurgery
20948400,Treatment of giant cerebral arteriovenous malformation: hypofractionated stereotactic radiation as the first stage.,"BACKGROUND: Treatment of giant cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) remains a challenge. OBJECTIVE: To propose hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT) as a part of staged treatment, and evaluate its effect by analyzing AVM volume changes. METHODS: From 2001 to 2007, 20 AVMs larger than 5 cm were treated by HSRT and followed up using magnetic resonance imaging. Patients' median age was 34 years (8-61 years). Eleven patients presented with hemorrhage and 9 with seizure. Ten patients had previous embolization and radiosurgery had failed in 4. Thirteen AVMs (65%) were classified as Spetzler-Martin grade V and 7 as grade IV. Median pretreatment volume was 46.84 cm³ (12.51-155.38 cm³). Dose was 25 to 30 Gy in 5 to 6 daily fractions. Median follow-up was 32 months. RESULTS: Median AVM volume decreased to 13.51 cm³ (range, 0.55-147.14 cm³). Residual volume varied from 1.5% to 98%. Volume decreased 44% every year on average. We noted that 6-Gy fractions were more effective (P = .040); embolized AVM tended to respond less (P = .085). After HSRT, we reirradiated 4 AVMs, with 3 amenable to single dose and one with fractions. After HSRT, one patient had an ischemic stroke and one had increased seizure frequency. One AVM bled during follow-up (2.06%/year). No complete obliteration was confirmed. CONCLUSION: HSRT can turn some giant AVMs manageable for single-dose radiosurgery. Six-Gray fractions were better than 5-Gy and routine embolization seemed unhelpful. There was no increase in bleeding risk with this approach. Future studies with longer follow-up are necessary to confirm our observation.",2010 Nov,2010,Neurosurgery,67,5,1253-9; discussion 1259,eng,False,10.1227/NEU.0b013e3181efbaef;00006123-201011000-00012;10.1227/NEU.0b013e3181efbaef,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Cerebral Hemorrhage/*etiology/*prevention & control;Child;Dose Fractionation, Radiation;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*complications/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/adverse effects/*methods;Radiotherapy Dosage;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",
21946724,Long-term outcome of proton beam radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations larger than 30 mm in diameter.,"The effectiveness of proton beam (PB) radiosurgery for large lesions is greater than for other treatment modalities. At our institute, PB radiosurgery is used to treat arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). We report the outcome of PB radiosurgery for AVMs over a period of 15 years, focusing on the efficacy of PB radiosurgery combined with embolization for AVMs ≥30 mm in diameter. We retrospectively analyzed 11 patients with AVMs ≥30 mm in diameter who were treated with PB radiosurgery between June 1990 and September 2005 at the Proton Medical Research Center of the University of Tsukuba. The mean irradiation dose was 25.3 gray-equivalent, and the mean duration of clinical follow up was 134.2 months (median 138 months). Pre-radiosurgical embolization was performed in all cases. Complete obliteration was achieved in 9 of the 11 patients. One patient experienced post-radiosurgical hemorrhage, and 1 patient experienced radiation-related aggravation of clinical symptoms due to radiation necrosis. Eight patients had excellent outcomes. The multimodal therapy approach of combining pre-radiosurgical embolization and PB radiosurgery for AVMs yielded a favorable outcome for AVMs ≥30 mm in diameter. Thus, PB radiosurgery is a viable treatment option for AVMs ≥30 mm in diameter.",2011,2011,Neurologia medico-chirurgica,51,9,624-9,eng,False,JST.JSTAGE/nmc/51.624;10.2176/nmc.51.624,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Child;*Combined Modality Therapy/methods;Embolization, Therapeutic/methods;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/*pathology/*therapy;Male;Middle Aged;Proton Therapy;Radiation Dosage;Radiation Injuries/epidemiology;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects/methods;Retrospective Studies;Time;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",

26723283,Outcomes of Volume-Staged Radiosurgery for Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformations Larger Than 20 cm(3) with More Than 3 Years of Follow-Up.,"OBJECTIVE: Treatment of extremely large cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is challenging. Although volume-staged stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a possible multimodal treatment option for such lesions, reports of these procedures are scarce. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of volume-staged SRS in patients with AVMs >20 cm(3) with >3 years of follow-up. METHODS: Between 2005 and 2012, 18 patients with AVMs >20 cm(3) were treated by volume-staged SRS. The median target volume was 38 cm(3) (interquartile range, 31-53 cm(3)). Treatment was conducted in 2-3 stages with a median interval of 6 months. RESULTS: The median follow-up period from the last SRS treatment was 53 months (interquartile range, 41-75 months). Complete nidus obliteration was achieved in 6 patients (33%), and the obliteration rate at 5 years after initial SRS was 35% by the Kaplan-Meier method. The annual hemorrhage rate after last SRS treatment was 3.9% (95% confidence interval, 0.8%-11.5%). Radiation-induced adverse effects occurred in 2 patients. CONCLUSIONS: In our series, volume-staged SRS for AVMs >20 cm(3) achieved a nidus obliteration rate of 35% at 5 years. There was still a high risk for hemorrhage (∼ 4% per year) after treatment, which seemed to be higher than the rate commonly observed in the posttreatment course of single-session SRS for average-size AVMs. Further cases will help determine whether volume-staged SRS could be routinely considered, based on its efficacy and risks, including comparison with the natural history of large AVMs.",2016 Mar,2016,World neurosurgery,87,,242-9,eng,False,S1878-8750(15)01698-8;10.1016/j.wneu.2015.12.020;S1878-8750(15)01698-8;10.1016/j.wneu.2015.12.020,Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Cerebral Angiography;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/*pathology/*surgery;Intracranial Hemorrhages/epidemiology/etiology;Kaplan-Meier Estimate;Male;Middle Aged;Neurosurgical Procedures/adverse effects/*methods;Postoperative Complications/epidemiology;Radiosurgery/adverse effects/*methods;Survival Analysis;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult,Gamma Knife radiosurgery;Large arteriovenous malformation;Staged stereotactic radiosurgery
22561285,[History of radiosurgery].,"Within the last decades, radiosurgery, also known as stereotactic radiotherapy, has become more and more popular as a non-invasive treatment of small benign tumours, arteriovenous malformations, metastases, and also some functional neurological structures, such as the fifth cranial nerve for trigeminal neuralgesia. It allows precisely delivering very high dose in a small volume under stereotactic conditions with minimal irradiation of tissue around the area. The first equipment devoted to radiosurgery was the Leksell Gamma Knife®. It is now challenged by some linear accelerators providing radiosurgery technology, such as the CyberKnife®, the Novalis Tx® radiosurgery platform, and the True Beam® linear accelerator.",2012 Jun,2012,Cancer radiotherapie : journal de la Societe francaise de radiotherapie,16 Suppl,,S2-4,fre,False,10.1016/j.canrad.2011.09.004;S1278-3218(12)00068-6;10.1016/j.canrad.2011.09.004,English Abstract;Historical Article;Journal Article,"Brain Neoplasms/surgery;Equipment Design;History, 20th Century;History, 21st Century;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery;Particle Accelerators/history;Radiosurgery/*history/instrumentation",
23683261,Fistula components of brain arteriovenous malformations: angioarchitecture analysis and embolization prior to gamma-knife surgery.,"BACKGROUND: Gamma-knife surgery (GKS) is ineffective for high-flow arteriovenous fistula (AVF). The purpose of this study was to present the angioarchitecture of the AVF of brain arteriovenous malformation (BAVM) and report our experience of endovascular embolization of AVF component prior to GKS. METHODS: In the past 10 years, a total of 523 BAVMs had been treated primarily by GKS. Among these, 10 patients with AVF components were identified and referred for embolization prior to GKS. Those patients underwent GKS within 4 weeks after embolization. We analyzed retrospectively the angioarchitecture of the AVFs of BAVMs, selection of embolic materials for embolization, and treatment outcomes. RESULTS: The location of the AVFs was anterior (n = 7) or middle (n = 3) cerebral artery. Central and peripheral types of AVFs were found in seven and three patients, respectively. Nine AVFs were totally occluded by a single session of endovascular embolization, while one failed to be embolized because it was inaccessible to a microcatheter. Detachable coils (n = 6) or combination of liquid adhesives (n = 3) were selected to embolize the AVF. No significant periprocedural neurological complication was found. BAVMs were obliterated totally by subsequent GKS in six patients and partial occlusion was achieved in one, while three still awaited the effect of GKS. Mean imaging and clinical follow-up periods were 35 and 48 months, respectively. CONCLUSION: Early detection of the central type of AVF of BAVM prior to GKS may be difficult because of its overlapping with feeder, nidus, and/or venous drains or it being overlooked. Peripheral-type AVFs were usually evident prior to GKS, particularly those with proximal dilated venous drains. Endovascular embolization is an effective modality for managing these AVFs, which may be treated by GKS ineffectively.",2013 May,2013,Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA,76,5,277-81,eng,False,S1726-4901(13)00028-2;10.1016/j.jcma.2013.01.011;S1726-4901(13)00028-2;10.1016/j.jcma.2013.01.011,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adult;Child;Embolization, Therapeutic/*methods;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/*methods;Retrospective Studies",
34333653,Effect of Prior Embolization on Outcomes After Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Pediatric Brain Arteriovenous Malformations: An International Multicenter Study.,"BACKGROUND: Pediatric brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are a significant cause of morbidity but the role of multimodal therapy in the treatment of these lesions is not well understood. OBJECTIVE: To compare the outcomes of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) with and without prior embolization for pediatric AVMs. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the International Radiosurgery Research Foundation pediatric AVM database. AVMs were categorized, based on use of pre-embolization (E + SRS) or lack thereof (SRS-only). Outcomes were compared in unadjusted and inverse probability weight (IPW)-adjusted models. Favorable outcome was defined as obliteration without post-SRS hemorrhage or permanent radiation-induced changes (RIC). RESULTS: The E + SRS and SRS-only cohorts comprised 91 and 448 patients, respectively. In unadjusted models, the SRS-only cohort had higher rates of obliteration (68.5% vs 43.3%, < .001) and favorable outcome (61.2% vs 36.3%, P < .001) but a lower rate of symptomatic RIC (9.0% vs 16.7%, P = .031). The IPW-adjusted rates of every outcome were similar between the 2 cohorts. However, cumulative obliteration rates at 3, 5, 8, and 10 yr remained higher in the absence of prior embolization (46.3%, 64.6%, 72.6%, and 77.4% for SRS-only vs 24.4%, 37.2%, 44.1%, and 48.7% for E + SRS cohorts, respectively; SHR = 0.449 [0.238-0.846], P = .013). CONCLUSION: Embolization appears to decrease cumulative obliteration rates after SRS for pediatric AVMs without affecting the risk of post-treatment hemorrhage or adverse radiation effects arguing against the routine use of pre-SRS embolization. While endovascular therapy can be considered for occlusion of high-risk angioarchitectural features prior to SRS, future studies are necessary to clarify its role.",2021 Sep 15,2021,Neurosurgery,89,4,672-679,eng,False,10.1093/neuros/nyab245;6333248;10.1093/neuros/nyab245,Journal Article;Multicenter Study,Brain;Child;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome,Arteriovenous malformation;Intracranial hemorrhage;Obliteration;Pediatric;Radiosurgery;Vascular malformation
36271057,Embolization before Gamma Knife radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations does not negatively impact its obliteration rate: a series of 190 patients.,"PURPOSE: Embolization of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) before radiosurgery has been reported to negatively impact the obliteration rate. This study aims to assess treatment outcomes in a series of 190 patients treated by Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for previously embolized AVMs. METHODS: The institutional database of AVMs was retrospectively reviewed between January 2004 and March 2018. The clinical and radiological data of patients treated with GKRS for previously embolized AVMs were analyzed. Predicting factors of obliteration and hemorrhage following GKRS were assessed with univariate and multivariate regression analyses. RESULTS: The mean AVM size was significantly reduced after embolization (p < 0.001). The obliteration rate was 78.4%. Multivariate analyses showed that a lower Spetzler-Martin grade (p = 0.035) and a higher marginal dose (p = 0.007) were associated with obliteration. Post-GKRS hemorrhages occurred in 14 patients (7.4%). A longer time between diagnosis and GKRS was the only factor associated with post-GKRS hemorrhages in multivariate analysis (p = 0.022). Complications related to the combined treatment were responsible for a new permanent neurological disability in 20 patients (10.5%), and a case of death (0.5%). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the embolization of AVMs does not have a negative impact on the obliteration rate after radiosurgery. Embolization reduces the AVM size to a treatable volume by GKRS. However, the combined treatment results in an increased complication rate related to the addition of the risks of each treatment modality.",2023 Feb,2023,Neuroradiology,65,2,391-399,eng,True,10.1007/s00234-022-03066-w;10.1007/s00234-022-03066-w;10.1007/s00234-022-03066-w,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Humans;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects/methods;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic;*Embolization, Therapeutic;Follow-Up Studies",Arteriovenous malformations;Embolization;Gamma Knife;Radiosurgery

METHODS: The study included 85 patients with brainstem AVMs undergoing GKS during the period 1989-2007. The locations of the nidi were the midbrain in 42 patients, pons in 31 patients, and medulla oblongata in 12 patients. The volume of the nidi ranged from 0.1-8.9 mL (median 1.4 mL, mean 1.9 mL), and the prescription dose ranged from 5-32 Gy (median 20 Gy, mean 19.9 Gy). After the initial Gamma procedure, 18 patients had repeat GKS for AVM residuals that were still patent. Two patients had a third GKS 7 years and 16 years after a failed repeat GKS. Clinical follow-up ranged from 24-252 months with a mean of 100 months (median 102 months) after the initial GKS. RESULTS: GKS yielded a total angiographic obliteration in 50 (58.8%) patients and subtotal obliteration in 4 (4.7%) patients. In 22 (25.9%) patients, the AVMs remained patent. In 9 patients (10.6%), no flow voids were observed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but angiographic confirmation was unavailable. A small nidus volume and a high prescription dose were significantly associated with increased AVM obliteration rate. Radiation-induced changes developed in 34 patients (40%); 24 were asymptomatic, 1 patient had only headache, and 9 patients developed neurologic deficits. One patient developed a large cyst 6 years after GKS.

RESULTS: There were 29 patients (47.5%) with subtype S1E1V1, 20 patients (32.8%) with subtype S2E1V0, and 12 patients (19.7%) with subtype S2E0V1. The rate of complete occlusion in all patients was 47.5% (29 patients). The rate of complete occlusion was higher in cases with a compact nidus (P < 0.001). Several parameters were associated with occlusion of the AVM nidus, including ≤3 arterial feeders (P = 0.017) and presentation with hemorrhage (P = 0.007), with the majority of patients with a compact nidus presenting with hemorrhage. Other factors associated with compact geometry were the presence of a single deep vein, ≤3 arterial feeders, ≤2 superficial draining veins, and an AVM nidus size ≤3 cm. CONCLUSIONS: The compact nature of grade III AVM is a crucial predictor for the success of embolization. Several characteristics associated with a compact nidus, such as presentation with hemorrhage and a lower number of arterial feeders, have a significantly higher closure rate. Other factors, such as a single deep draining vein, reduced superficial venous drainage, and small size, show a strong association with complete obliteration.",2023 Dec,2023,World neurosurgery,180,,e749-e755,eng,False,S1878-8750(23)01424-9;10.1016/j.wneu.2023.10.019;S1878-8750(23)01424-9;10.1016/j.wneu.2023.10.019,Journal Article,"Humans;Treatment Outcome;Retrospective Studies;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery/complications;*Radiosurgery/methods;Postoperative Hemorrhage/therapy;*Embolization, Therapeutic",Compact nidus;Endovascular treatment;Geometrical characteristics;Grade III arteriovenous malformation

METHODS: Two hundred and thirteen patients diagnosed with AVMs were treated between January 1991 and December 2005. Seventy-three percent of the patients had hemorrhaged prior to treatment, 13% had had previous surgery and 19.2% had had previous embolization. The median follow-up duration was 48.1 months. RESULTS: The Kaplan-Meier analysis estimated that the 36-month obliteration rate was 65.5% for patients undergoing their first stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and 68.3% for those undergoing repeated SRS. The Kaplan-Meier analysis estimated the 60-month AVMs obliteration rate for the entire cohort to be 82.4%. The median time to AVM obliteration was 40 ± 2.8 months. We found a statistically significant relationship between the time of obliteration and the following factors: site of the AVMs (sites other than brainstem), a higher prescribed dose and a positive history of previous hemorrhage. Thirteen patients (7.6%) experienced toxicities. CONCLUSIONS: SRS was an effective and safe treatment for AVMs ≤3 cm in diameter, with acceptable toxicity.",2011,2011,Stereotactic and functional neurosurgery,89,6,338-45,eng,True,10.1159/000330837;000330837;10.1159/000330837,Journal Article,Adult;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Radiosurgery/*methods;Radiotherapy Dosage;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome,

30544289,Integration of rotational angiography enables better dose planning in Gamma Knife radiosurgery for brain arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVEIn Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKS) for arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), CT angiography (CTA), MRI, and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) are generally used to define the nidus. Although the AVM angioarchitecture can be visualized with superior resolution using rotational angiography (RA), the efficacy of integrating RA into the GKS treatment planning process has not been elucidated.METHODSUsing data collected from 25 consecutive patients with AVMs who were treated with GKS at the authors' institution, two neurosurgeons independently created treatment plans for each patient before and after RA integration. For all patients, MR angiography, contrasted T1 imaging, CTA, DSA, and RA were performed before treatment. The prescription isodose volume before (PIVB) and after (PIVA) RA integration was measured. For reference purposes, a reference target volume (RTV) for each nidus was determined by two other physicians independent of the planning surgeons, and the RTV covered by the PIV (RTVPIV) was established. The undertreated volume ratio (UVR), overtreated volume ratio (OVR), and Paddick's conformal index (CI), which were calculated as RTVPIV/RTV, RTVPIV/PIV, and (RTVPIV)2/(RTV × PIV), respectively, were measured by each neurosurgeon before and after RA integration, and the surgeons' values at each point were averaged. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare the values obtained before and after RA integration. The percentage change from before to after RA integration was calculated for the average UVR (%ΔUVRave), OVR (%ΔOVRave), and CI (%ΔCIave) in each patient, as ([value after RA integration]/[value before RA integration] - 1) × 100. The relationships between prior histories and these percentage change values were examined using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.RESULTSThe average values obtained by the two surgeons for the median UVR, OVR, and CI were 0.854, 0.445, and 0.367 before RA integration and 0.882, 0.478, and 0.463 after RA integration, respectively. All variables significantly improved after compared with before RA integration (UVR, p = 0.009; OVR, p < 0.001; CI, p < 0.001). Prior hemorrhage was significantly associated with larger %ΔOVRave (median 20.8% vs 7.2%; p = 0.023) and %ΔCIave (median 33.9% vs 13.8%; p = 0.014), but not %ΔUVRave (median 4.7% vs 4.0%; p = 0.449).CONCLUSIONSIntegrating RA into GKS treatment planning may permit better dose planning owing to clearer visualization of the nidus and, as such, may reduce undertreatment and waste irradiation.

27757503,"Predictors for occlusion of cerebral AVMs following radiation therapy : Radiation dose and prior embolization, but not Spetzler-Martin grade.","BACKGROUND: Intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) may show a harmful development. AVMs are treated by surgery, embolization, or radiation therapy. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated obliteration rates and side effects in patients with AVMs treated by radiation therapy. METHODS: A total of 40 cases treated between 2005 and 2013 were analyzed. Single-dose stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) was received by 13 patients and 27 received hypofractionated stereotactic radiation therapy (HSRT). In 20 patients, endovascular embolization had been performed prior to irradiation and 24 patients (60 %) had a history of previous intracranial hemorrhage. RESULTS: Treatment resulted in complete obliteration (CO) in 23/40 cases and partial obliteration in 8/40. CO was achieved in 85 % of patients receiving SRS compared to 44 % of those receiving HSRT. In the HSRT group, a first indication of an influence of AVM volume on obliteration rate was found. Equivalent 2 Gy fraction doses (EQD2) >70 Gy showed an obliteration rate of 50 %. Prior embolization was significantly associated with a higher portion of CO (p = 0.032). Median latency period (24.2 vs. 26 months) until CO was similar in both groups (SRS vs. HSRT). The rate of intracranial hemorrhage in patients with no prior bleeding events was 0 %. CONCLUSION: Excellent obliteration rates were achieved by SRS. Consistent with the literature, this data analysis suggests that the results of HSRT are volume-dependent. Furthermore, regimens with EQD2 doses >70 Gy appear more likely to achieve obliteration than schemes with lower doses. The findings indicate that radiation therapy does not increase the risk of bleeding.

21332288,Combined endovascular embolization and stereotactic radiosurgery in the treatment of large arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECT: Large cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are often not amenable to direct resection or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) treatment. An alternative treatment strategy is staged endovascular embolization followed by SRS (Embo/SRS). The object of this study was to examine the experience at Washington University in St. Louis with Embo/SRS for large AVMs and review the results in earlier case series. METHODS: Twenty-one cases involving patients with large AVMs treated with Embo/SRS between 1994 and 2006 were retrospectively evaluated. The AVM size (before and after embolization), procedural complications, radiological outcome, and neurological outcome were examined. Radiological success was defined as AVM obliteration as demonstrated by catheter angiography, CT angiography, or MR angiography. Radiological failure was defined as residual AVM as demonstrated by catheter angiography, CT angiography, or MR angiography performed at least 3 years after SRS. RESULTS: The maximum diameter of all AVMs in this series was > 3 cm (mean 4.2 cm); 12 (57%) were Spetzler-Martin Grade IV or V. Clinical follow-up was available in 20 of 21 cases; radiological follow-up was available in 19 of 21 cases (mean duration of follow-up 3.6 years). Forty-three embolization procedures were performed; 8 embolization-related complications occurred, leading to transient neurological deficits in 5 patients (24%), minor permanent neurological deficits in 3 patients (14%), and major permanent neurological deficits in none (0%). Twenty-one SRS procedures were performed; 1 radiation-induced complication occurred (5%), leading to a permanent minor neurological deficit. Of the 20 patients with clinical follow-up, none experienced cerebral hemorrhage. In the 19 patients with radiological follow-up, AVM obliteration was confirmed by catheter angiography in 13, MR angiography in 2, and CT angiography in 1. Residual nidus was found in 3 patients. In patients with follow-up catheter angiography, the AVM obliteration rate was 81% (13 of 16 cases). CONCLUSIONS: Staged endovascular embolization followed by SRS provides an effective means of treating large AVMs not amenable to standard surgical or SRS treatment. The outcomes and complication rates reported in this series compare favorably to the results of other reported therapeutic strategies for this very challenging patient population.",2011 Jun,2011,Journal of neurosurgery,114,6,1758-67,eng,False,10.3171/2011.1.JNS10571;10.3171/2011.1.JNS10571,Journal Article,"Adult;Aged;Cerebral Angiography;Combined Modality Therapy;Embolization, Therapeutic/adverse effects/*methods;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/surgery/*therapy;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/adverse effects/*methods;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome",
31147229,Transitional venous anomalies and DVAs draining brain AVMs: A single-institution case series and review of the literature.,"OBJECTIVE: Developmental venous anomalies (DVAs) are typically benign lesions purely venous in nature. However, a subset of DVAs are either 1) associated with brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) or 2) demonstrate shunting themselves. The goal of this case series and literature review is to present clinical characteristics, management strategies and outcomes of this patient population. METHODS: Consecutive patients with arteriovenous shunting DVAs or DVAs draining nidal-AVMs were retrospectively reviewed. Lesions were classified as transitional DVAs or AVM-associated DVAs. Variables studied included clinical presentation, location, size, venous drainage, and malformation architecture. Treatment outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: We identified 8 patients with transitional or AVM-associated DVAs from our institution. Six patients had unruptured lesions and two presented with hemorrhage. We classified 5 malformations as transitional DVAs and 3 as AVMs draining into DVAs. Three patients were conservatively managed, while 5 patients underwent treatment of the shunt by means of surgery (4) or radiosurgery (1). One patient suffered a right frontal venous infarct resulting in left sided weakness post-operatively. In the literature review we found 44 additional cases (Total = 30 transitional DVAs and 22 AVM-associated DVAs). Patients with transitional DVAs were more symptomatic than patients with AVM-associated DVAs (41.4% vs 22.2%). Permanent neurologic deficit following radiosurgical or microneurosurgical treatment of transitional DVAs was 28.6% compared to 16.7% for AVMs draining into DVAs. CONCLUSIONS: Transitional DVAs and AVMs draining into DVAs are rare lesions.

17586215,Repeat stereotactic radiosurgery for high-grade and large intracranial arteriovenous malformations.,"BACKGROUND: The treatment of large and high-grade (Spetzler-Martin III-V) AVMs remains a challenge. There is a paucity of literature addressing the efficacy of radiosurgery in this group. We retrospectively analyze our experience with repeat radiosurgery with such AVMs. METHODS: Between 1989 and 2004, 14 patients with large and high-grade AVMs deemed to be nonoperative candidates were treated with repeat radiosurgery. Patients were treated either on a LINAC or gamma knife-based system at 2- to 3-year intervals with targeting of the entire nidus with each treatment. Patients who did not receive their full treatment course or follow-up at the institution were excluded. RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 18 months. The complete obliteration rate was 35.7%, with a mean volume reduction of 53% in the remaining lesions. Twenty percent of grade III and 50% of grade IV lesions experienced cure. Complications included persistent headaches (2 patients). Statistical analysis revealed no difference between obliterated and partially obliterated groups with regard to mean pretreatment volume (24.87 cm(3)), median Spetzler-Martin grade (IV), mean follow-up (30.5 months), total delivered dose (3550 cGy), mean dose per stage (13 Gy), median number of stages (2), or mean interval between treatment stages (40 months). CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates the potential role of repeat radiosurgery in the treatment of this cohort in the context of our short follow-up. The benefits of repeat therapy could be derived from using lower doses per session and repeat targeting of the lesion in an effort to increase response and decrease complication rates.",2007 Jul,2007,Surgical neurology,68,1,24-34; discussion 34,eng,False,S0090-3019(06)00984-0;10.1016/j.surneu.2006.10.028,Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Cerebral Angiography;Child;Cohort Studies;Follow-Up Studies;Headache/etiology;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Middle Aged;Radiation Dosage;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects/methods;Reoperation;Retrospective Studies;Time Factors,

22027260,Proposal for a new prognostic score for linac-based radiosurgery in cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"PURPOSE: We evaluate patient-, angioma-, and treatment-specific factors for successful obliteration of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM) to develop a new appropriate score to predict patient outcome after linac-based radiosurgery (RS). METHODS AND MATERIALS: This analysis in based on 293 patients with cerebral AVM. Mean age at treatment was 38.8 years (4-73 years). AVM classification according Spetzler-Martin was 55 patients Grade I (20.5%), 114 Grade II (42.5%), 79 Grade III (29.5%), 19 Grade IV (7.1%), and 1 Grade V (0.4%). Median maximum AVM diameter was 3.0 cm (range, 0.3-10 cm). Median dose prescribed to the 80% isodose was 18 Gy (range, 12-22 Gy). Eighty-five patients (29.1%) had prior partial embolization; 141 patients (51.9%) experienced intracranial hemorrhage before RS. Median follow-up was 4.2 years. RESULTS: Age at treatment, maximum diameter, nidus volume, and applied dose were significant factors for successful obliteration. Under presumption of proportional hazard in the dose range between 12 and 22 Gy/80% isodose, an increase of obliteration rate of approximately 25% per Gy was seen. On the basis of multivariate analysis, a prediction score was calculated including AVM maximum diameter and age at treatment. The prediction error up to the time point 8 years was 0.173 for the Heidelberg score compared with the Kaplan-Meier value of 0.192. An increase of the score of 1 point results in a decrease of obliteration chance by a factor of 0.447. CONCLUSION: The proposed score is linac-based radiosurgery-specific and easy to handle to predict patient outcome.

27759676,Worse Outcomes After Repeat vs Initial Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformations: A Retrospective Matched-Cohort Study.,"BACKGROUND: Incompletely obliterated cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) after initial treatment with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) can be treated with a repeat session of SRS. However, the relative efficacy of repeat vs initial SRS is not well specified. OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively compare in matched cohorts the outcomes of repeat vs initial SRS for the treatment of matched cohorts with angioarchitecturally similar AVMs. METHODS: We studied a data set of patients with AVM treated with radiosurgery during the period spanning 1989 to 2013. Patients with AVM who underwent repeat SRS with radiologic follow-up of ≥2 years or nidus obliteration were identified for the study and matched, in a 1:1 fashion that was blinded to outcome, to patients with previously untreated AVMs who underwent initial SRS. Statistical analyses were performed to compare the outcomes after repeat vs initial SRS. RESULTS: The matching approach resulted in 84 patients for the repeat and the initial SRS cohort (mean margin doses, 20.7 and 20.9 Gy, respectively; P = .74). In the repeat SRS cohort, obliteration was achieved in 67%; the radiologic, symptomatic, and permanent radiation-induced change rates were 35%, 10%, and 4%, respectively; and the post-SRS hemorrhage rate was 3.1%/y. Compared with the initial SRS cohort, the repeat SRS cohort had significantly lower obliteration rates (P = .04) and higher post-SRS hemorrhage rates (P = .04). The radiation-induced change rates of the 2 cohorts were not significantly different. CONCLUSION: Repeat SRS yields considerably poorer outcomes than initial SRS for angioarchitecturally comparable AVMs. Further studies in AVM radiobiology and vascular structure are necessary to elucidate this potentially differential response.

Intra-procedural dislodgement of the stereotactic frame is an uncommon occurrence that could lead to abortion of ongoing treatment and necessitate more invasive treatment strategies. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: In this case report, we describe a novel method for resumption of Gamma Knife treatment after an unplanned intra-procedural interruption. The case example involves a radiosurgical treatment of a Spetzler-Martin grade I arteriovenous malformation. CONCLUSION: Our technique involves integration of scans and coordinate systems from two imaging sessions using the composite isodose line to resolve translational differences, thereby limiting delivery of remaining shots to the untreated region of the lesion. MRI follow-up at 13 months showed a reduction in the nidus size with no evidence of any radiation injury to the surrounding brain parenchyma.

29114088,Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformations: Primary ONYX Embolization in ARUBA (A Randomized Trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformations)-Eligible Patients.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In light of evidence from ARUBA (A Randomized Trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformations), neurovascular specialists had to reconsider deliberate treatment of unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations (uBAVMs). Our objective was to determine the outcomes of uBAVM treated with primary embolization using ethylene vinyl alcohol (ONYX). METHODS: Patients with uBAVM who met the inclusion criteria of ARUBA and were treated with primary Onyx embolization were assigned to this retrospective study. The primary outcome was the modified Rankin Scale score. Secondary outcomes were stroke or death because of uBAVM or intervention and uBAVM obliteration. RESULTS: Sixty-one patients (mean age, 38 years) were included. The median observation period was 60 months. Patients were treated by embolization alone (41.0%), embolization and radiosurgery (57.4%), or embolization and excision (1.6%). Occlusion was achieved in 44 of 57 patients with completed treatment (77.2%). Forty-seven patients (77.1%) had no clinical impairment at the end of observation (modified Rankin Scale score of <2). Twelve patients (19.7%) reached the outcome of stroke or death because of uBAVM or intervention. Treatment-related mortality was 6.6% (4 patients).

A 17-year-old young man underwent GKS after embolization for arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in the right frontal lobe and the AVM completely disappeared. He developed a generalized convulsion 15 years after GKS. MRI showed a small oedematous change at the AVM site. His epileptic seizure was controlled with anticonvulsant. His epilepsy recurred after three years, and MRI revealed an intracerebral hematoma with extensive surrounding edema at the same lesion. He underwent cerebral angiography and a recurrence of AVM was prevented. The hematoma was surgically removed, and intraoperative finding confirmed an old hematoma with a capsule and capillary hyperplasia, without developing cavernous angioma. The final diagnosis was a secondary chronic encapsulated expanding hematoma after GKS.

18503331,Treatment of arteriovenous malformations with linear accelerator-based radiosurgery compared with Gamma Knife surgery.,"OBJECT: The authors sought to compare the outcomes of patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) treated by Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) with those of patients treated by linear accelerator-based (LINAC) radiosurgery. METHODS: One hundred and eighty-seven patients with AVMs were treated at our institution between 1992 and 2003. Ninety-one patients were treated with GKS and 96 patients were treated with LINAC radiosurgery. Patient and treatment characteristics in the two groups included the following. In the LINAC group, the median age was 33 years (range 9-66 years); the median dose was 16 Gy (70% isodose line); the median treated AVM volume was 5.5 cm3; and 46% of patients in this group were treated after hemorrhage. In the GKS group, the median age was 38 years (range 6-63 years); the median dose was 20 Gy (50% isodose line); the median treated AVM volume was 4.3 cm3; and 44% of patients in this group were treated after hemorrhage. Obliteration of AVMs was determined by performing computed tomography (CT) angiography and/or magnetic resonance (MR) angiography and angiography. Patient follow-up evaluation included obtaining an MR angiogram/MR image or CT angiogram at 6 months, at 1 year, and then annually thereafter. Angiography was performed to confirm obliteration when MR angiography and/or CT angiography no longer revealed evidence of an AVM. The 5-year estimated AVM obliteration rate was 66% in the entire patient group; the LINAC group was 60%; the GKS group was 72%; this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.97). Twelve patients who underwent treatment with LINAC radiosurgery underwent retreatment with GKS and one was retreated with LINAC radiosurgery. The obliteration rate was 82%. Six patients treated with GKS were retreated with GKS, but the follow-up time is of short duration. Chronic toxicity occurred in 8% of both the GKS and the LINAC groups (p = 0.61). Posttreatment hemorrhage during the time of risk before AVM obliteration was 13% in the GKS group and 6.2% in the LINAC group (p = 0.05).

27423196,Treatment of Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformations with Radiosurgery or Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiotherapy in a Consecutive Pooled Linear Accelerator Series.,"OBJECTIVE: To review outcomes after linear accelerator stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (hfSRT) of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) from a consecutive and pooled series of 2 Novalis centers and to analyze the influence of AVM size, Spetzler-Martin (SM) grade, pretreatment, and hemorrhagic versus nonhemorrhagic presentation. A subgroup analysis of A Randomized Trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformations (ARUBA)-eligible patients also was performed. METHODS: Prospectively collected treatment and outcome data were supplemented by retrospectively collected follow-up data for 93.8% of all patients. A total of 129 patients with AVM had SRS or hfSRT between 2000 and 2014 with the same linear accelerator system in 2 centers. Data analysis included initial presentation, SM grade, occlusion rates assessed by magnetic resonance and/or digital subtraction angiography, neurologic and therapeutic complications, and pretreatments. Statistical analysis was performed for patient demographic data and for factors potentially influencing outcome. RESULTS: Initial presentation was hemorrhage in 43.8% or seizures/neurologic deficits in 46.2%. The series included 6 SM grade I (5%), 26 SM II (21.5%), 55 SM III (45.5%), 28 SM IV (23%), and 6 SM V cases (5%). Pre-embolization was used in 36 patients (29.8%), 8 patients had previous surgery (6.6%), and 6 patients were irradiated before elsewhere (5%); 5 patients (4.2%) received multimodal pretreatment. Mean follow-up was 43 months. The occlusion rate for the total series was 71.1%, for SM I/II cases 80.6%, and 67.4% for the SM ≥ subgroup. The occlusion rate was 75.0% for the small volume (<4 cc) and 55.6% for the large volume (>10 cc) subgroup. There was no statistical difference between the occlusion rate of patients with or without pretreatment if taken all modalities together (72.7% and 69.7%, respectively). There was only a trend of a belated occlusion of pre-embolized AVMs. The occlusion rate for hemorrhagic AVM was with 77.4% better than for nonhemorrhagic (66.2%) or ARUBA-eligible AVMs (64.8%) but without reaching statistical significance. Neurologic deterioration was seen in 13.2% of the patients. There were 2 re-bleedings within 17-18 months (1.7%), 1 of them without a new neurologic deficit and total occlusion after re-SRS. One patient with pre-existing epilepsy died a sudden unexpected death (mortality rate: 0.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Overall SRS and hfSRT are valuable therapy options, especially in symptomatic patients with AVM, with a low rate of morbidity and mortality and an acceptable overall complete occlusion rate of >70% and >80% for SM I/II AVMs.",2016 Oct,2016,World neurosurgery,94,,328-338,eng,False,S1878-8750(16)30538-1;10.1016/j.wneu.2016.07.016;S1878-8750(16)30538-1;10.1016/j.wneu.2016.07.016,Comparative Study;Journal Article;Multicenter Study,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Child;Female;Germany/epidemiology;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*mortality/*radiotherapy;Male;Middle Aged;Prevalence;*Radiation Dose Hypofractionation;Radiation Injuries/*mortality/prevention & control;Radiosurgery/*mortality/*statistics & numerical data;Retrospective Studies;Risk Factors;Survival Rate;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",ARUBA study;Cerebral arteriovenous malformation;Hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy;Linear accelerator–based radiosurgery;Outcome data;Radiosurgery

METHODS: We analyzed 40 patients with intracranial AVMs with a mean follow-up of 29 (range, 23-34) months. Seven AVMs (17.5%) had a volume <1 cm(3); 10 (25%), 1 to 4 cm(3); 13 (32.5%), 4.1 to 10 cm(3); and 10 (25%), >10 cm(3). The mean prescription dose was 15.4 Gy. Twenty-six patients (68%) presented hemorrhage before treatment; 4 (10%), chronic headache; 14 (35%), seizures; and 3(8%), neurologic deficit. RESULTS: Seven patients (17.5%) underwent objective clinical improvement. Thirty patients (75%) remained without clinical changes. Three patients (7.5%) developed edema and 1 (2.5%) had a rebleeding after treatment. Twenty-five patients (63%) presented complete obliteration of the AVM. A successful treatment (obliteration without a new deficit) was obtained in 23 (58%) of the cases. The percentage of obliteration was in <1 cm(3) (86%), 1 to 4 cm(3) (80%), 4.1 to 10 cm(3) (54%), and >10 cm(3) (40%), without a significant difference between groups (P = .1). Patients with RBAS of <or=1.9 had an obliteration of 79% and, those with >1.9, 48%; the successful treatment in the former resulted in 79% and, in the latter, 38% (P = .08 and P = .02, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The clinical outcome was similar to other series.

33866943,Comparison of cerebral AVMs in patients undergoing surgical resection with and without prior endovascular embolization.,"AIM: Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are congenital anomalies that present as intracranial hemorrhage or epilepsy. AVMs often remain clinically silent for extended periods. Although AVM treatment methods are controversial, three treatment strategies are usually combined or applied alone: surgical removal, embolization and stereotactic radiosurgery. We compared clinical and radiological outcomes in intracranial AVM patients treated via surgical resection with and without prior embolization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who did (30 patients) and did not (30 patients) undergo endovascular embolization before surgical resection at the İzmir Katip Çelebi University Atatürk Training and Research Hospital Neurosurgery Clinic from 2011 to 2019 were included in this retrospective, cohort study. Symptoms at diagnosis, comorbidities and clinical (AVM and Spetzler-Martin grade) and morphological characteristics were assessed. RESULTS: A mean one-year follow-up assessed outcomes using the modified Rankin score, and imaging studies assessed AVM obliteration post-procedure. Mean operation times for surgical resection with and without embolization were 166.50 ± 32.02 and 204.47 ± 26.66 min, respectively. Mean patient hospitalization periods for surgical resection with and without embolization were 8.43 ± 3.60 and 12.00 ± 5.51 days, respectively.

32335814,Impact of flow and angioarchitecture on brain arteriovenous malformation outcome after gamma knife radiosurgery: the role of hemodynamics and morphology in obliteration.,"BACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated the relationship between brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) angioarchitecture and the response to Gamma Knife Stereotactic Radiosurgery (GKSR). METHODS: A prospectively enrolled single-center cohort of patients with bAVMs treated by GKSR has been studied to define independent predictors of obliteration with particular attention to angioarchitectural variables. Only patients older than 18 years old (y.o.), who underwent baseline digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and clinico-radiological follow-up of at least 36 months, were included in the study. RESULTS: Data of 191 patients were evaluated. After a mean follow-up of 80 months (range 37-173), total obliteration rate after first GKSR treatment was 66%. Mean dose higher than 22 Gy (P = .019, OR = 2.39, 95% CI 1.15-4.97) and flow rate dichotomized into high vs non-high (P < .001, OR = 0.23, 95% CI 0.11-0.51) resulted to be independent predictors of obliteration. Flow-surrogate angioarchitectural features did not emerge as independent outcome predictors. CONCLUSIONS: Flow rate seems to be associated in predicting outcome after GKSR conferring high-flow AVM a lower occlusion rate. Its role should be considered when planning radiosurgical treatment of bAVM, and it could be added to other parameters used in GKRS outcome predicting scales.",2020 Jul,2020,Acta neurochirurgica,162,7,1749-1757,eng,True,10.1007/s00701-020-04351-4;10.1007/s00701-020-04351-4;10.1007/s00701-020-04351-4,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Angiography, Digital Subtraction;Child;Female;*Hemodynamics;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic;Male;Middle Aged;Postoperative Complications/epidemiology/*etiology;Radiography;Radiosurgery/adverse effects/*methods",Angioarchitecture;Brain arteriovenous malformations;Flow;Gamma knife radiosurgery
36007951,Noninvasive Follow-up Imaging of Ruptured Pediatric Brain AVMs Using Arterial Spin-Labeling.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Brain AVMs represent the main etiology of pediatric intracranial hemorrhage. Noninvasive imaging techniques to monitor the treatment effect of brain AVMs remain an unmet need. In a large cohort of pediatric ruptured brain AVMs, we aimed to investigate the role of arterial spin-labeling for the longitudinal follow-up during treatment and after complete obliteration by analyzing CBF variations across treatment sessions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with ruptured brain AVMs referred to a pediatric quaternary care center were prospectively included in a registry that was retrospectively queried for children treated between 2011 and 2019 with unimodal or multimodal treatment (surgery, radiosurgery, embolization). We included children who underwent an arterial spin-labeling sequence before and after treatment and a follow-up DSA. CBF variations were analyzed in univariable analyses. RESULTS: Fifty-nine children with 105 distinct treatment sessions were included. The median CBF variation after treatment was -43 mL/100 mg/min (interquartile range, -102-5.5), significantly lower after complete nidal surgical resection. Following radiosurgery, patients who were healed on the last DSA follow-up demonstrated a greater CBF decrease on intercurrent MR imaging, compared with patients with a persisting shunt at last follow-up (mean, -62 [SD, 61] mL/100 mg/min versus -17 [SD, 40.1] mL/100 mg/min; P = .02). In children with obliterated AVMs, recurrences occurred in 12% and resulted in a constant increase in CBF (mean, +89 [SD, 77] mL/100 mg/min). CONCLUSIONS: Our results contribute data on the role of noninvasive arterial spin-labeling monitoring of the response to treatment or follow-up after obliteration of pediatric AVMs. Future research may help to better delineate how arterial spin-labeling can assist in decisions regarding the optimal timing for DSA.",2022 Sep,2022,AJNR.

31322166,Re-Evaluation of the Size Limitation in Single-Session Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Brain Arteriovenous Malformations: Detailed Analyses on the Outcomes with Focusing on Radiosurgical Doses.,"BACKGROUND: Single-session stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for large arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) ≥10 mL remains controversial, which is considered as the current size limitation. OBJECTIVE: To reconsider the size limitation of SRS for AVMs by profoundly analyzing dose-volume relationship. METHODS: Data on 610 consecutive patients with AVM treated with SRS using regular (18-22 Gy) or low (<18 Gy) prescription doses were retrospectively analyzed. AVMs were classified into 4 groups: small (<5 mL), medium (≥5 and <10 mL), medium-large (≥10 and <15 mL), and large (≥15 mL). The maximum volumes were 22.5 mL (regular-dose group) and 23.5 mL (low-dose group). RESULTS: When treated with regular doses, the cumulative 6-yr obliteration rates for each of the 4 AVM groups were 86%, 80%, 87%, and 79%, respectively; the cumulative 10-yr significant neurological event (SNE) rates were 2.6%, 3.9%, 6.8%, and 5.3%, respectively. Regarding large AVMs, regular-dose SRS resulted in marginally better obliteration rate (6-yr cumulative rate, 79% vs 48%, P = .111) and significantly lower SNE (5-yr cumulative rate, 5% vs 31%, P = .038) and post-SRS hemorrhage rate (8-yr cumulative rate, 0% vs 54%, P = .002) compared to low-dose SRS. Multivariate analyses revealed that regular-dose SRS significantly contributed to increase in the obliteration rate and decrease in SNEs and hemorrhage. CONCLUSION: The outcomes for large AVMs were generally favorable when treated with ablative doses. Single-session SRS could be acceptable for AVMs up to ≈20 mL if treated with ablative doses.",2020 May 1,2020,Neurosurgery,86,5,685-696,eng,True,10.1093/neuros/nyz280;5535922;10.1093/neuros/nyz280,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*radiotherapy;Male;Middle Aged;Multivariate Analysis;Radiation Dosage;Radiation Injuries/etiology;Radiosurgery/adverse effects/*methods;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",Arteriovenous malformation;Gamma knife;Radiotherapy;Size limitation;Stereotactic radiosurgery;Stroke
29572169,Surgical Management of Adverse Radiation Effects After Gamma Knife Radiosurgery for Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformations: A Population-Based Cohort Study.,"OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to report our experience in the surgical treatment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (cAVMs) related permanent symptomatic adverse radiation effects (PSAREs), to clarify an appropriate surgical management and to identify the risk factors related to their development. METHODS: We evaluated 549 patients treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for cAVMs with a follow-up of at least 8 years. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to test different risk factors related to the development of PSARE. We retrospectively reviewed the records of these patients to analyze the clinical outcome. RESULTS: Fourteen patients (2.5%) developed PSARE and were submitted to surgery. Higher average treated volume represents a significant risk factors for the development of PSARE (P < 0.05); on the other hand, older age and higher average dose reduce the risk of PSARE (P < 0.05). A favorable clinical outcome was achieved in 13 patients (93%) after surgery; in 1 patient, the unfavorable outcome was due to hemorrhage that occurred months after GKRS. Serial MRI scans following either surgical removal of the nodule or Ommaya reservoir positioning showed progressive reduction of brain edema in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: The management of PSARE is controversial, especially for cAVMs treated with SRS. Surgical removal is rarely needed, but-if unavoidable-it can be a valuable option in experienced hands.

25014752,Is stereotactic radiosurgery the best treatment option for patients with a radiosurgery-based arteriovenous malformation score ≤ 1?,"OBJECTIVE: The best management of patients with brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVM) is controversial. The radiosurgery-based arteriovenous malformation (AVM) score (RBAS) was developed to predict outcomes for patients with BAVM having stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). METHODS: The RBAS is calculated for patients with BAVM having SRS at our center as part of our prospectively maintained SRS database (RBAS = [0.1] [AVM volume; cm(3)] + [0.02] [patient age; years] + [0.5] [AVM location; 0 = cerebral/cerebellar hemispheres/corpus callosum, 1 = basal ganglia/thalamus/brainstem]). Review of the SRS database from 1990 to 2009 identified 80 patients with a RBAS ≤1 and at least 1 year of follow-up. The primary end point of the study was a decline in modified Rankin Score. The mean follow-up after SRS was 68 months (range, 12-133). RESULTS: The mean patient age was 25.2 years (range, 7-44). Seventy-six patients (95%) had superficially located BAVMs; the mean BAVM volume was 2.3 cm(3) (range, 0.1-8.0). The mean RBAS was 0.76 (range, 0.21-1.00). The patients' MRS before SRS was 0 (n = 52, 65%), 1 (n = 24, 30%), 2 (n = 3, 4%), and 3 (n = 1, 1%). BAVM obliteration was confirmed in 92% of patients with follow-up beyond 3 years (70/76; 95% confidence interval 84%-97%). No patient had a hemorrhage or a radiation-related complication after SRS. The observed rate of modified Rankin Score decrease after SRS was 0% (0/80; 95% confidence interval 0%-6%). CONCLUSIONS: SRS provided a high rate of obliteration at very low risk for patients with BVAM with a RBAS ≤1.

32376156,A comparative outcomes analysis of patients treated for arteriovenous malformation with LINAC-based stereotactic radiosurgery by a standard frame-based technique or a frameless technique utilizing 3-dimensional rotational angiography.,"Previous work at our institution treating arteriovenous malformation (AVM) with radiosurgery (RS) demonstrated superior nidus visualization and geometric accuracy with use of 3-dimensional rotational angiography (3DRA) compared to biplanar digital subtraction angiography. We have since adopted a unique radiosurgical protocol that utilizes 3DRA in the planning of linear accelerator (LINAC)-based RS delivered in a frameless manner. This study seeks to compare clinical outcomes between patients treated by this novel approach and those treated by our historic frame-based protocol. Clinical data were queried for all patients treated for AVM by single-fraction RS from 2003 to 2017. RICs were identified and classified as radiologic, symptomatic, or permanent. Excellent outcome was defined as nidus obliteration without intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) or symptomatic RIC. Clinical predictors of study outcomes were identified through univariate and multivariate logistic regression using backwards elimination to optimize a predictive model. 131 AVMs in 124 patients were included with a median follow-up of 88 months. 59 AVMs received frame-based RS and 72 AVMs received frameless RS. Rate of obliteration was 64% for frame-based RS and 61% for frameless RS (p = 0.70). Radiologic, symptomatic, and permanent RICs rates were 68%, 17%, and 8%, respectively, for frame-based cases, versus 40% (p < 0.01), 8% (p = 0.13), and 3% (p = 0.15), respectively, for frameless cases. Excellent outcome was achieved in 49% of frame-based cases and 53% of frameless cases (p = 0.68). These results illustrate the safety and effectiveness of frameless LINAC-based AVM RS utilizing 3DRA.",2020 Jul,2020,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society,77,,185-190,eng,True,S0967-5868(20)30513-0;10.1016/j.jocn.2020.04.102;S0967-5868(20)30513-0;10.1016/j.jocn.2020.04.102,Comparative Study;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Angiography, Digital Subtraction;Child;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Intracranial Hemorrhages/*epidemiology;Male;Middle Aged;Particle Accelerators;Postoperative Complications/*epidemiology;Radiosurgery/adverse effects/instrumentation/*methods",Arteriovenous malformation;Excellent outcome;Frameless;Obliteration;Radiation-induced change;Radiosurgery;Rotational Angiography
30497981,Fully automated tissue segmentation of the prescription isodose region delineated through the Gamma knife plan for cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) using fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering.,"BACKGROUND: Gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) is a common treatment for cerebral arterio-venous malformations (AVMs), particularly in cases where the malformation is deep-seated, large, or in eloquent areas of the brain. Unfortunately, these procedures can result in radiation injury to brain parenchyma. The fact that every AVM is unique in its vascular morphology makes it nearly impossible to exclude brain parenchyma from isodose radiation exposure during the formulation of a GKRS plan. Calculating the percentages of the various forms of tissue exposed to specific doses of radiation is crucial to understanding the clinical responses and causes of brain parenchyma injury following GKRS for AVM. METHODS: In this study, we developed a fully automated algorithm using unsupervised classification via fuzzy c-means clustering for the analysis of T2 weighted images used in a Gamma knife plan. This algorithm is able to calculate the percentages of nidus, brain tissue, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the prescription isodose radiation exposure region. RESULTS: The proposed algorithm was used to assess the treatment plan of 25 patients with AVM who had undergone GKRS. The Dice similarity index (SI) was used to determine the degree of agreement between the results obtained using the algorithm and a visually guided manual method (the gold standard) performed by an experienced neurosurgeon. In the nidus, the SI was (74.86 ± 1.30%) (mean ± standard deviation), the sensitivity was (83.05 ± 11.91)%, and the specificity was (86.73 ± 10.31)%. In brain tissue, the SI was (79.50 ± 6.01)%, the sensitivity was (73.05 ± 9.77)%, and the specificity was (85.53 ± 7.13)%. In the CSF, the SI was (69.57 ± 15.26)%, the sensitivity was (89.86 ± 5.87)%, and the specificity was (92.36 ± 4.35)%. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed clustering algorithm provides precise percentages of the various types of tissue within the prescription isodose region in the T2 weighted images used in the GKRS plan for AVM. Our results shed light on the causes of brain radiation injury after GKRS for AVM. In the future, this system could be used to improve outcomes and avoid complications associated with GKRS treatment.",2019,2019,NeuroImage.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: This analysis is based on 48 patients with cerebral AVM greater than 4 cm treated with HSRT or RS at our institution. Fifteen patients received HSRT, with 26 Gy median total dose in 4 to 5 fractions, and 33 patients received RS with 17 Gy median total dose in 4 to 5 fractions. Median target volume was 27 cc in HSRT and 7 cc in RS; median maximum diameter was 6 cm and 5 cm, respectively. Seventeen patients experienced intracranial hemorrhage before treatment. Median follow-up was 2.6 years. RESULTS: The 3-year and 4-year actuarial complete obliteration (CO) after HSRT was 17% and 33% and after RS was 47% and 60%, respectively. Actuarial CO was higher in AVMs less than 5 cm (66% vs. 37% after 4 years). Intracranial hemorrhage after HSRT occurred in 3 of 15 patients after 18 months median, and after RS in 7 of 33 patients after 17 months median. Bleeding risk was significantly higher in patients with prior hemorrhage (p < 0.04). Preexisting neurologic dysfunction improved/dissolved in 50% and remained stable in 45%.

28173493,Staged-Volume Radiosurgery of Large Arteriovenous Malformations Improves Outcome by Reducing the Rate of Adverse Radiation Effects.,"BACKGROUND: The treatment of large arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) remains challenging. Recently, staged-volume radiosurgery (SVRS) has become an option. OBJECTIVE: To compare the outcome of SVRS on large AVMs with our historical, single-stage radiosurgery (SSRS) series. METHODS: We have been prospectively collecting data of patients treated by SVRS since 2007. There were 84 patients who had a median age of 37 years (range, 9-62 years) who were treated until July 2013. The outcomes of 76 of those who had follow-ups available were analyzed and compared with the outcomes of 122 patients treated with the best SSRS technique. RESULTS: There were 21.5% of AVMs that were deep seated, and 44% presented with hemorrhage resulting in 45% fixed neurological deficit. There were 14% of patients who had undergone embolization before radiosurgery. The median nidus treatment volume was 19.7 cm3 (6.65-68.7) and 17.5 Gy (13-22.5) prescription isodose was given. Of the 44 lesions having radiological follow-up at 4 years, 61.4% were completely obliterated. Previous embolization (50% with and 63% without) and higher Spetzler-Martin grades appeared to be the negative factors in successful obliteration, but treatment volume was not. Within 3 years after radiosurgery, the annual bleed rates of unruptured and previously ruptured AVMs were 3.2% and 5.6%, respectively. Three bleeds were fatal and 2 resulted in significant modified Rankin scale 3 morbidity. These rates differ little from SSRS. Temporary adverse radiation effects (AREs) did not change significantly, but permanent AREs dropped from 15% to 6.5% (P = .03) compared with SSRS. CONCLUSION: Obliteration and hemorrhage rates of large AVMs treated by SVRS are similar to historical SSRS. However, SVRS offers a lower rate of AREs.",2017 Feb 1,2017,Neurosurgery,80,2,180-192,eng,False,10.1227/NEU.0000000000001212;2901912;10.1227/NEU.0000000000001212,Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Child;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*radiotherapy;Middle Aged;Postoperative Complications/*prevention & control;Prospective Studies;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects/methods;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult,
19052389,Analysis of X-knife and surgery in treatment of arteriovenous malformation of brain.,"BACKGROUND: The goal of treatment in arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is total obliteration of the AVM, restoration of normal cerebral function, and preservation of life and neurological function. AIM: To analyze the results of X-knife and surgery for AVM of the brain. The endpoints for success or failure were as follows: success was defined as angiographic obliteration and failure as residual lesion, requiring retreatment, or death due to hemorrhage from the AVM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From May 2002 to May 2007, 54 patients were enrolled for this study. Grade I AVM was seen in 9%, grade II in 43%, grade III in 26%, grade IV in 9%, and grade V in 13%. Thirty-eight patients were treated by microsurgical resection out of which Grade I was seen in 5 patients, Grade II was seen in 17 patients, Grade III was seen in 9 patients and Grade V was seen in 7 patients. Rest of the sixteen patients were treated by linear accelerator radiosurgery out of which Grade II was seen in 6 patients, Grade III was seen in 5 patients and Grade IV was seen in 5 patients. The follow up was in range of 3-63 months. In follow up, digital subtraction angiography/ magnetic resonance angiography (DSA/MRA) was performed 3 months after surgery and 1 year and 2 years after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). RESULTS: Among the patients treated with X-knife, 12/16 (75%) had proven angiographic obliteration. Complications were seen in 4/16 (25%) patients. Among the patients treated with microsurgical resection, 23/38 (61%) had proven angiographic obliteration. Complications (both intraoperative and postoperative) were seen in 19/38 (50%) patients.

17937217,Is repeated radiosurgery an alternative to staged radiosurgery for very large brain arteriovenous malformations?,"OBJECT: The results of a novel radiosurgical approach to treat large arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) with repeated radiosurgery are presented and discussed. METHODS: The outcome was studied following repeated Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) for large AVMs, defined as a nidus volume of 9 ml or more. The philosophy was to treat the whole AVM with a low dose of radiation (> or = 10 Gy), and to repeat the treatment if the AVM shrank but was not obliterated. The study included 133 patients with AVMs treated at one of three different institutions. Clinical information was available for all patients, and complete radiological follow-up was available in 89 patients after the first treatment, and in 19 after the second treatment. RESULTS: The estimated obliteration rate following repeated GKS was 62%. Four patients (3%) developed neurological deficits caused by the radiation, whereas five others (4%) developed cystic changes. The annual incidence of hemorrhage was high (7%), of which 35% occurred within the 1st year after the first treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated radiosurgery seems to be a viable option for some AVMs considered to be too large for conventional radiosurgical treatment.

Treatment options for AVMs include surgical resection, embolization, or stereotactic radiosurgery, or any combination of these procedures. The risk of a chosen management strategy must include the sum of the risk of all the interventions applied to a given lesion, and this should be compared with the natural history of a given lesion in a particular clinical setting.

METHODS: A novel radiosurgery system was developed at the University of Michigan Medical Center with a standard multileaf collimator and a computer-controlled radiotherapy system. Data were accumulated prospectively on all patients undergoing treatment with this system since treatment began in 1995. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients with 37 AVMs have undergone treatment to date. At more than 3 years since treatment, 15 of 16 AVMs with a volume of less than 10 cc were proven to be obliterated by angiography or magnetic resonance imaging, and one was considered a treatment failure. At more than 24 months since therapy, all four AVMs with a volume of 10 to 25 cc were obliterated. Four patients with AVMs with a volume of more than 25 cc have undergone staged therapy, treating the entire volume to 10 Gy twice, but none has been followed long enough to demonstrate a final outcome. There were four transient and no permanent complications. CONCLUSION: Our early data indicate that stereotactic radiosurgery of cerebral AVMs with a linear accelerator and a multileaf collimator is safe and effective. Large AVMs may be especially suitable for this mode of therapy. Staged treatment of very large AVMs seems to be a promising addition to standard treatment, but longer follow-up is necessary to confirm that complete obliteration can be achieved.",2000 Jul,2000,Neurosurgery,47,1,123-8; discussion 128-30,eng,True,10.1097/00006123-200007000-00026,Clinical Trial;Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Child;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Middle Aged;Prospective Studies;Radiosurgery/*instrumentation,

16682140,Pediatric cerebral arteriovenous malformations: the role of stereotactic linac-based radiosurgery.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate retrospectively clinical outcome and obliteration rates after linac-based radiosurgery (RS) in children with cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1996 and 2002, 22 children with cerebral AVM were treated at our institution. Mean age at treatment was 11.8 years (range, 4.4-16.4 years). Classification according to Spetzler-Martin was 1 child grade I (4%), 7 grade II (32%), 12 grade III (56%), 1 grade IV (4%), and 1 grade V (4%). Median single dose was 18 Gy/80%-isodose. Median AVM volume was 4.2 mL (range, 0.4-26.5 mL). Median RS-based AVM-score was 1.07 (range, 0.61-3.55). Fifty-nine percent of children experienced intracranial hemorrhage before RS. Median follow-up was 3.1 years (range, 1.7-7.3 years). RESULTS: Actuarial complete obliteration rate (CO) was 54% after 3 years and 65% after 4 years, respectively. Median time interval to CO was 27.1 months. Intracranial hemorrhage after RS was seen in five children after median 13.9 months. Annual bleeding risk was 9.1% after 1 year and 13.6% after 2 years. Maximum diameter>or=3 cm and AVM-volume>or=6 mL were significant predictors for intracranial hemorrhage. Neurologic deficits were improved/completely dissolved in 58% of children and remained stable in 42%. No new onset of neurologic dysfunction was seen after RS. CONCLUSIONS: RS is safe and effective in pediatric cerebral AVM with high obliteration rates. Size and volume of AVM are significant predictors for intracranial bleeding.

28625906,Impact of Associated Nidal Lesions in Outcome of Brain Arteriovenous Malformations After Radiosurgery with or without Embolization.,"BACKGROUND: Radiosurgery is a valuable option to treat arteriovenous malformations. There are correlations between some morphologic nidal features and final results, and the benefits of preradiosurgical embolization have not been well established thus far. METHODS: Analysis of a longitudinal cohort of 47 consecutive patients who underwent radiosurgery with or without previous embolization. Embolizations were performed exclusively with n-butyl cyanoacrylate. Radiosurgery was delivered either as a single fraction or divided in up to 5 equal fractions. Clinical and radiologic follow-up of at least 36 months was obtained. Presence of nidal lesions, such as aneurysms, venous outflow stenosis, venous outflow ectasias, and/or intranidal arteriovenous fistulas, were evaluated, and their relation with outcome and complications were studied. RESULTS: Of the patients, 68.1% presented with hemorrhagic event; of these, 62.5% harbored intranidal arteriovenous fistulas, 83.3% had venous ectasias, and 90% had venous outflow stenosis. Occlusion rate of embolization plus radiosurgery was 46.1%, and stereotactic radiosurgery alone was 52.4% (P = 0.671). Variables significantly associated with obliteration were lower nidus volume, lack of intranidal arteriovenous fistula, higher stereotactic radiosurgery dose, and lower radiosurgical-based arteriovenous malformation scale score. CONCLUSIONS: An untreated arteriovenous fistula inside the arteriovenous malformation at the moment of stereotactic radiosurgery was associated with lower cure rates (P = 0.001). Embolization followed by radiosurgery was not superior to radiosurgery alone; however, targeted embolization of intranidal arteriovenous fistulas to increase obliteration rates and to protect the patient from bleeding during the radiosurgery latency period should be considered.",2017 Sep,2017,World neurosurgery,105,,643-650,eng,True,S1878-8750(17)30936-1;10.1016/j.wneu.2017.06.044;S1878-8750(17)30936-1;10.1016/j.wneu.2017.06.044,Comparative Study;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Arteriovenous Fistula/diagnostic imaging/*therapy;Cohort Studies;Embolization, Therapeutic/*methods/trends;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/*therapy;Longitudinal Studies;Male;Radiosurgery/*methods/trends;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",Brain arteriovenous malformation;Cerebral hemorrhage;Embolization;Endovascular treatment;Radiosurgery
28344176,Stereotactic Radiosurgery for ARUBA (A Randomized Trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformations)-Eligible Spetzler-Martin Grade I and II Arteriovenous Malformations: A Multicenter Study.,"OBJECTIVE: ARUBA (A Randomized Trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformations) found better short-term outcomes after conservative management compared with intervention for unruptured arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). However, because Spetzler-Martin (SM) grade I-II AVMs have the lowest treatment morbidity, sufficient follow-up of these lesions may show a long-term benefit from intervention. The aim of this multicenter, retrospective cohort study is to assess the outcomes after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for ARUBA-eligible SM grade I-II AVMs. METHODS: We pooled SRS data for patients with AVM from 7 institutions and selected ARUBA-eligible SM grade I-II AVMs with ≥12 months follow-up for analysis. Favorable outcome was defined as AVM obliteration, no post-SRS hemorrhage, and no permanently symptomatic radiation-induced changes. RESULTS: The ARUBA-eligible SM grade I-II AVM cohort comprised 232 patients (mean age, 42 years). The mean nidus volume, SRS margin dose, and follow-up duration were 2.1 cm(3), 22.5 Gy, and 90.5 months, respectively. The actuarial obliteration rates at 5 and 10 years were 72% and 87%, respectively; annual post-SRS hemorrhage rate was 1.0%; symptomatic and permanent radiation-induced changes occurred in 8% and 1%, respectively; and favorable outcome was achieved in 76%. Favorable outcome was significantly more likely in patients treated with a margin dose >20 Gy (83%) versus ≤20 Gy (62%; P < 0.001). Stroke or death occurred in 10% after SRS. CONCLUSIONS: For ARUBA-eligible SM grade I-II AVMs, long-term SRS outcomes compare favorably with the natural history.

22208972,Factors predictive of symptomatic radiation injury after linear accelerator-based stereotactic radiosurgery for intracerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"PURPOSE: To investigate predictive factors in the development of symptomatic radiation injury after treatment with linear accelerator-based stereotactic radiosurgery for intracerebral arteriovenous malformations and relate the findings to the conclusions drawn by Quantitative Analysis of Normal Tissue Effects in the Clinic (QUANTEC). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Archived plans for 73 patients who were treated at the British Columbia Cancer Agency were studied. Actuarial estimates of freedom from radiation injury were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used for analysis of incidence of radiation injury. Log-rank test was used to search for dosimetric parameters associated with freedom from radiation injury. RESULTS: Symptomatic radiation injury was exhibited by 14 of 73 patients (19.2%). Actuarial rate of symptomatic radiation injury was 23.0% at 4 years. Most patients (78.5%) had mild to moderate deficits according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. On univariate analysis, lesion volume and diameter, dose to isocenter, and a V(x) for doses ≥8 Gy showed statistical significance. Only lesion diameter showed statistical significance (p < 0.05) in a multivariate model. According to the log-rank test, AVM volumes >5 cm(3) and diameters >30 mm were significantly associated with the risk of radiation injury (p < 0.01). The V(12) also showed strong association with the incidence of radiation injury. Actuarial incidence of radiation injury was 16.8% if V(12) was <28 cm(3) and 53.2% if >28 cm(3) (log-rank test, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that the risk of developing symptomatic radiation injury after radiosurgery is related to lesion diameter and volume and irradiated volume. Results suggest a higher tolerance than proposed by QUANTEC.

15066303,Alpha/beta ratio for arteriovenous malformations estimated from obliteration rates after fractionated and single-dose irradiation.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Results from single-dose radiosurgery have failed to yield reasonable alpha/beta ratios for obliteration rates of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in the framework of the linear-quadratic approach. We used outcome data from single-dose and fractionated radiotherapy for AVM to approach this problem. PATIENTS AND METHODS: AVM obliteration rates observed in an updated historical series of fractionated radiotherapy and from six recent series of single-dose stereotactic radiosurgery were analyzed. Reciprocal total doses (1/D) and fraction sizes (d) of isoeffective fractionation schemes were entered into the rearranged form of the linear-quadratic equation: 1/D = (alpha/E) + (beta/E)d, and alpha/beta-ratios were calculated from the parameters of the regression line. RESULTS: Fractionated radiotherapy with 20 Gy/4 Gy fractions, 50 Gy/2 Gy fractions and single-dose radiosurgery of approximately 13 Gy were isoeffective with crude obliteration rates of 13%. The analysis yielded an alpha/beta-ratio of 3.5 Gy. For small-sized AVMs (<3 cm), alpha/beta-ratios of 4.6-6.4 Gy were obtained. CONCLUSION: These results support the view that radiosurgery for AVM can be understood as a typical late tissue effect with a high fractionation sensitivity.

20607249,Radiosurgical management of pediatric arteriovenous malformations.,"PURPOSE: Hemorrhage from an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is the commonest cause of childhood stroke. Management options for children include observation and medical management, surgical resection, endovascular embolization, or stereotactic radiosurgery, alone or in combination. METHODS: Radiosurgery is used for high-risk malformations in critical brain locations. While this goal is being achieved, there should be limited morbidity and hopefully no mortality from hemorrhage or radiation-induced brain injury. RESULTS: Physicians who consider AVM radiosurgery cite one or more of the following: (1) that radiosurgery is an effective therapy required for the management of deep-brain AVMs; (2) that radiosurgery is an effective therapy for residual AVMs after subtotal resection; (3) that radiosurgery is worthwhile in an attempt to lower management risks for AVMs in functional brain locations; (4) since embolization does not cure most AVMs, additional therapy such as radiosurgery may be required; and (5) microsurgical resection may not be the best choice for some children. CONCLUSION: Radiosurgery is the first and only biologic AVM therapy; it represents the beginnings of future cellular approaches to vascular malformation diseases. For this reason, the future of radiosurgery may be impacted positively by the development of other biologic strategies such as brain protection or endothelial sensitization.",2010 Oct,2010,Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for,26,10,1359-66,eng,False,10.1007/s00381-010-1207-x;10.1007/s00381-010-1207-x,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Cerebral Angiography;Child;Child, Preschool;Embolization, Therapeutic/methods;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Radiosurgery/*methods/trends;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome",
33153456,Changes in treatment strategy over time for arteriovenous malformation in a Japanese high-volume center.,"BACKGROUND: Despite rapid developments in devices used to treat arteriovenous malformation (AVM), a randomised trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous malformations published in 2014 recommended conservative treatment for nonhemorrhagic AVM. The purpose of the current retrospective study was to confirm how AVM treatment in Japan has changed and to assess the safety of treatment for hemorrhagic and nonhemorrhagic AVMs. METHODS: We enrolled 242 consecutive patients with AVM; each patient's treatment was selected and performed at our hospital. The type of onset, Spetzler-Martin (S-M) grade, age, sex, selected treatment, mortality, and morbidity were compared between the first and second periods of our study. RESULTS: In patients with grade I-III AVM, the selected treatment changed between the first and second periods; however, in grade IV and V patients, the selected treatment did not change. Overall, interventions by microsurgery alone decreased (p < 0.001), the proportion of total treatments including microsurgery decreased (p = 0.005), interventions using stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) alone increased (p = 0.009), and interventions including SRS increased (p = 0.002). Morbidity associated with intervention was 0.92% in the first period and 0% in the second period, and mortality was 0.92% in the first period and 1.67% in the second. CONCLUSIONS: With the development of new devices, the selected treatment was changed in patients with S-M grade I-III AVM, but was not changed in patients with grade IV and V. The complication rate was low and did not change throughout the periods. These findings suggest that the safety of treatment depends on a full understanding of device development and the selection of proper treatment, not on hemorrhagic onset.

28009228,Microsurgery for Spetzler-Ponce Class A and B arteriovenous malformations utilizing an outcome score adopted from Gamma Knife radiosurgery: a prospective cohort study.,"OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to adapt and apply the extended definition of favorable outcome established for Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) to surgery for brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs). The aim was to derive both an error around the point estimate and a model incorporating angioarchitectural features in order to facilitate comparison among different treatments. METHODS A prospective microsurgical cohort was analyzed. This cohort included patients undergoing embolization who did not proceed to microsurgery and patients denied surgery because of perceived risk of treatment. Data on bAVM residual and recurrence during long-term follow-up as well as complications of surgery and preoperative embolization were analyzed. Patients with Spetzler-Ponce Class C bAVMs were excluded because of extreme selection bias. First, patients with a favorable outcome were identified for both Class A and Class B lesions. Patients were considered to have a favorable outcome if they were free of bAVM recurrence or residual at last follow-up, with no complication of surgery or preoperative embolization, and a modified Rankin Scale score of more than 1 at 12 months after treatment. Patients who were denied surgery because of perceived risk, but would otherwise have been candidates for surgery, were included as not having a favorable outcome. Second, the authors analyzed favorable outcome from microsurgery by means of regression analysis, using as predictors characteristics previously identified to be associated with complications. Third, they created a prediction model of favorable outcome for microsurgery dependent upon angioarchitectural variables derived from the regression analysis. RESULTS From a cohort of 675 patients who were either treated or denied surgery because of perceived risk of surgery, 562 had Spetzler-Ponce Class A or B bAVMs and were included in the analysis. Logistic regression for favorable outcome found decreasing maximum diameter (continuous, OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.51-0.76), the absence of eloquent location (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.12-0.43), and the absence of deep venous drainage (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.10-0.36) to be significant predictors of favorable outcome. These variables are in agreement with previous analyses of microsurgery leading to complications, and the findings support the use of favorable outcome for microsurgery. The model developed for angioarchitectural features predicts a range of favorable outcome at 8 years following microsurgery for Class A bAVMs to be 88%-99%. The same model for Class B bAVMs predicts a range of favorable outcome of 62%-90%. CONCLUSIONS Favorable outcome, derived from GKRS, can be successfully used for microsurgical cohort series to assist in treatment recommendations. A favorable outcome can be achieved by microsurgery in at least 90% of cases at 8 years following microsurgery for patients with bAVMs smaller than 2.5 cm in maximum diameter and, in the absence of either deep venous drainage or eloquent location, patients with Spetzler-Ponce Class A bAVMs of all diameters. For patients with Class B bAVMs, this rate of favorable outcome can only be approached for lesions with a maximum diameter just above 6 cm or smaller and without deep venous drainage or eloquent location.",2017 Nov,2017,Journal of neurosurgery,127,5,1105-1116,eng,False,10.3171/2016.8.JNS161275;10.3171/2016.8.JNS161275,Comment;Journal Article,Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Microsurgery;Prospective Studies;*Radiosurgery;Treatment Outcome,AVM = arteriovenous malformation;CTA = CT angiography;DSA = digital subtraction angiography;GKRS = Gamma Knife radiosurgery;MRA = MR angiography;RCT = randomized controlled trial;VRAS = Virginia Radiosurgery AVM Scale;arteriovenous malformation;bAVM = brain AVM;brain;cohort study;mRS = modified Rankin Scale;stereotactic radiosurgery;surgery;vascular disorders
30895568,Correlation of Appearance of MRI Perinidal T2 Hyperintensity Signal and Eventual Nidus Obliteration Following Photon Radiosurgery of Brain AVMs: Combined Results of LINAC and Gamma Knife Centers.,"BACKGROUND: A wide variety of radiologic changes occur within and adjacent to the nidus of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Our objective was to study the magnetic resonance imaging(MRI)-defined changes following photon radiosurgery of AVMs and specifically to correlate the appearance of a perinidal T2 hyperintensity signal with the eventual angiographic obliteration of an AVM nidus in response to SRS treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted on 62 patients with brain AVMs who received photon SRS treatments between 2004 and 2017, using either a technique based on a linear accelerator at the Alexandria LINAC Radiosurgery Center in Egypt (21 patients/AVMs) or a technique based on a gamma unit at the Koto Memorial Gamma Knife Center in Japan (41 patients/AVMs). All patients included in the study had serial clinical and radiologic follow-ups for ≥ 2 years after SRS treatments. RESULTS: In the combined study series of 62 patients/AVMs treated with photon SRS, the follow-up MRIs revealed that 50 AVMs (80.6%) showed nonvisualized nidus and 12 AVMs (19.4%) showed decreased nidus size. Radiation-induced changes, defined as appearance of perinidal T2 hyperintensities in post-SRS MRIs, occurred in 34 patients (54.8%). Of the 35 patients with available follow-up angiographic studies, 30 AVMs (85.7%) demonstrated complete nidus obliteration at a mean of 36 months (range: 8-66 months) after SRS. Of the 30 AVMs with both MRI evidence of a nonvisualized nidus and angiographic verification of complete nidus obliteration, 20 AVMs (66.7%) were associated with prior MRI evidence of the appearance of a perinidal T2 hyperintensity signal at an average of 12 months (range: 6-45 months) after SRS. Of the five AVMs with both MRI evidence of decreased nidus size and angiographic verification of partial nidus obliteration, four AVMs (80%) showed perinidal T2 hyperintensity signal on post-SRS follow-up MRIs. Lower Spetzler-Martin grade (p = 0.013), smaller AVM volume (p = 0.017), and appearance of post-SRS perinidal T2 hyperintensity signal (p = 0.007) were the statistically significant independent predictors of AVM obliteration. The appearance of perinidal T2 hyperintensity signal in the post-SRS MRIs had a sensitivity of 66.7%, a specificity of 20%, and an overall accuracy of 60% in predicting the eventual obliteration of the AVM nidus. CONCLUSIONS: The present study may help improve our current understanding of the mechanisms behind the radiation-induced tissue changes following AVM SRS. Because the SRS-induced hemodynamic changes within the AVM nidus initiate the cascade of the subsequent formation of perinidal vasogenic brain edema, the appearance of perinidal high T2 signal in the follow-up MRIs after SRS would be a valuable indicator of the AVM response to SRS. The development of perinidal hyperintensity was the strongest predictive factor of AVM obliteration (p = 0.007), with relatively high sensitivity (66.7%) and accuracy (60%) and fairly low specificity (20%), as a prognostic sign of eventual complete angiographic obliteration of the AVM nidus following SRS.",2019 May,2019,"Journal of neurological surgery.

19123890,"Staged radiosurgery for extra-large cerebral arteriovenous malformations: method, implementation, and results.","OBJECT: The effectiveness and safety of radiosurgery for small- to medium-sized cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) have been well established. However, the management for large cerebral AVMs remains a great challenge to neurosurgeons. In the past 5 years the authors performed preplanned staged radiosurgery to treat extra-large cerebral AVMs. METHODS: An extra-large cerebral AVM is defined as one with nidus volume > 40 ml. The nidus volume of cerebral AVM is measured from the dose plan-that is, as being the volume contained within the best-fit prescription isodose. From January 2003 to December 2007, the authors treated 6 patients with extra-large AVMs by preplanned staged GKS. Staged radiosurgery is implemented by rigid transformation with translation and rotation of coordinates between 2 stages. The average radiation-targeted volume was 60 ml (range 47-72 ml). The presenting symptoms were seizure in 4 patients and a bleeding episode in 2. One patient had undergone a previous craniotomy and evacuation of hematoma. The mean interval between the 2 radiosurgical sessions was 6.9 months (range 4.5-9.1 months). The prescribed marginal dose given to the nidus volume in each stage ranged from 16 to 18.6 Gy. The expected marginal dose of total nidus was 17-19 Gy. Regular follow-up MR imaging was performed every 6 months. The mean follow-up period was 28 months (range 12-54 months). RESULTS: Most of the patients exhibited clinical improvement: relief of headache and reduced frequency of seizure attack. All patients had significant regression of nidus observed on MR imaging follow-up. Two patients had angiogram-confirmed complete obliteration of the nidus 45 and 60 months after the second-stage radiosurgical session. One patient experienced minor bleeding 8 months after the second-stage radiosurgery with mild headache. She had satisfactory recovery without clinical neurological deficit after conservative treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results indicate that staged radiosurgery is a practical strategy to treat patients with extra-large cerebral AVMs. It takes longer to obliterate the AVMs. The observed high signal T2 changes after the radiosurgery appeared clinically insignificant in 6 patients followed up for an average of 28 months. Longer follow-up is necessary to confirm its long-term safety.",2008 Dec,2008,Journal of neurosurgery,109 Suppl,,65-72,eng,False,10.3171/JNS/2008/109/12/S11;10.3171/JNS/2008/109/12/S11,Journal Article,Adult;Cerebral Angiography;Cohort Studies;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/pathology/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Radiosurgery/adverse effects/*methods;Radiotherapy Dosage;Retrospective Studies;Risk Assessment;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult,

METHODS: Between 1987 and 2006, the authors performed Gamma Knife surgery in 996 patients with brain AVMs, including 217 patients with AVMs classified as Spetzler-Martin Grade I or II. The median maximum diameter and target volumes were 1.9 cm (range 0.5-3.8 cm) and 2.3 cm(3) (range 0.1-14.1 cm(3)), respectively. The median margin dose was 22 Gy (range 15-27 Gy). RESULTS: Arteriovenous malformation obliteration was confirmed by MR imaging in 148 patients and by angiography in 100 patients with a median follow-up of 64 months (range 6-247 months). The actuarial rates of total obliteration determined by angiography or MR imaging after 1 SRS procedure were 58%, 87%, 90%, and 93% at 3, 4, 5, and 10 years, respectively. The median time to complete MR imaging-determined obliteration was 30 months. Factors associated with higher AVM obliteration rates were smaller AVM target volume, smaller maximum diameter, and greater marginal dose. Thirteen patients (6%) suffered hemorrhages during the latency period, and 6 patients died. Cumulative rates of AVM hemorrhage 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 years after SRS were 3.7%, 4.2%, 4.2%, 5.0%, and 6.1%, respectively. This corresponded to rates of annual bleeding risk of 3.7%, 0.3%, and 0.2% for Years 0-1, 1-5, and 5-10, respectively, after SRS. The presence of a coexisting aneurysm proximal to the AVM correlated with a significantly higher hemorrhage risk. Temporary symptomatic adverse radiation effects developed in 5 patients (2.3%) after SRS, and 2 patients (1%) developed delayed cysts. CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic radiosurgery is a gradually effective and relatively safe option for patients with smaller volume Spetzler-Martin Grade I or II AVMs who decline initial resection. Hemorrhage after obliteration did not occur in this series. Patients remain at risk for a bleeding event during the latency interval until obliteration occurs.

22784875,Validation of the modified radiosurgery-based arteriovenous malformation score in a linear accelerator radiosurgery experience in Hong Kong.,"The modified radiosurgery-based arteriovenous malformation (AVM) score (modified AVM score or Pollock-Flickinger AVM score [PFAS]) is a simplified grading system developed to predict outcome after gamma knife radiosurgery for cerebral AVM. The purpose of this study was to test the PFAS in a cohort of patients managed with linear accelerator (LINAC) radiosurgery. We analyzed 70 consecutive patients with cerebral AVM treated with LINAC radiosurgery in Hong Kong. The scores were determined by the following equation: Modified AVM score=(0.1×volume [cm(3)])+(0.02×age [years])+(0.5×location). The location values are as follows: hemispheric/corpus callosum/cerebellar=0; basal ganglia/thalamus/brainstem=1. A total of 74% of patients presented with ruptured AVM before radiosurgery. The overall obliteration rate was 86%. Five (7%) patients developed new permanent neurological deficits from delayed bleeding or radiation-induced complications. Modified AVM score correlated with the percentage of patients with AVM obliteration without new neurological deficits (≤1, 96%; 1.01-1.50, 78%; 1.51-2.00, 90%; >2, 50%; Spearman's rho 0.354, p=0.003).

22608804,Surgical and radiosurgical results of the treatment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"Microsurgical resection of a cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) allows for an immediate therapeutic cure. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a reasonable alternative for inoperable or high-risk lesions requiring treatment. Few series evaluate overall results that include data from both modalities as they more often focus on their treatment method of choice. In this study, we evaluated our AVM database of 129 patients seen over the past eight years at our institution: 73 were treated with microsurgery (57%) while 37 (29%) were treated with SRS. We reviewed angiographic obliteration rates, complication rates, and outcome data, excluding seven patients treated with SRS as they did not have at least two years of angiographic follow-up. Patients undergoing microsurgery had smaller AVM (mean 2.2 cm compared to 3.5 cm for SRS), a smaller proportion of eloquent AVM (53% compared to 83% for SRS), a greater proportion of AVM with superficial drainage only (75% compared to 40% for SRS), and more grade 1 and 2 AVM (78% compared to 17% for SRS). The overall obliteration rate was 80%: 92% for microsurgery and 50% for SRS. The latter increased to 92% for AVM <3 cm, but the obliteration rate was 18% for those AVM >3 cm. Transient complications, including post-SRS hemorrhage, were seen in 11% of patients overall (8% after microsurgery, 17% after SRS). At follow-up, 53% of patients had improved, 37% remained the same, 7% had become worse and 3% had died. As a result of post-SRS hemorrhage, a greater proportion of patients was worse or had died after SRS (20%) compared to those who had been treated with microsurgery (5%).",2012 Jul,2012,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society,19,7,1001-4,eng,True,10.1016/j.jocn.2012.01.004;S0967-5868(12)00007-0;10.1016/j.jocn.2012.01.004,Journal Article,Adult;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;Microsurgery/*methods;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/*methods;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome,

The object of this study was to report the results of using volume-staged Gamma Knife radiosurgery for patients affected by large and complex AVMs. METHODS Data from 20 patients with large AVMs were prospectively included in the authors' AVM database between 2004 and 2012. A staging strategy was used when treating lesion volumes larger than 10 cm(3). Hemorrhage and seizures were the presenting clinical feature for 6 (30%) and 8 (40%) patients, respectively. The median AVM volume was 15.9 cm(3) (range 10.1-34.3 cm(3)). The mean interval between stages (± standard deviation) was 15 months (± 9 months). The median margin dose for each stage was 20 Gy (range 18-25 Gy). RESULTS Obliteration was confirmed in 8 (42%) patients after a mean follow-up of 45 months (range 19-87 months). A significant reduction (> 75%) of the original nidal volume was achieved in 4 (20%) patients. Engel Class I-II seizure status was reported by 75% of patients presenting with seizures (50% Engel Class I and 25% Engel Class II) after radiosurgery. After radiosurgery, 71.5% (5/7) of patients who had presented with a worsening neurological deficit reported a complete resolution or amelioration. None of the patients who presented acutely because of hemorrhage experienced a new bleeding episode during follow-up. One (5%) patient developed radionecrosis that caused sensorimotor hemisyndrome. Two (10%) patients sustained a bleeding episode after GKRS, although only 1 (5%) was symptomatic. High nidal flow rate and a time interval between stages of less than 11.7 months were factors significantly associated with AVM obliteration (p = 0.021 and p = 0.041, respectively). Patient age younger than 44 years was significantly associated with a greater than 75% reduction in AVM volume but not with AVM obliteration (p = 0.024). CONCLUSIONS According to the results of this study, volume-staged GKRS is an effective and safe treatment strategy for large, complex, cerebral AVMs for which microsurgery or endovascular approaches could carry substantially higher risks to the patient. Radiation doses up to 20 Gy can be safely administered. The time interval between stages should be shorter than 11.7 months to increase the chance of obliteration. High nidal flow and a patient age younger than 44 years were factors associated with nidus obliteration and significant nidus reduction, respectively.",2016 Dec,2016,Journal of neurosurgery,125,Suppl 1,104-113,eng,False,10.3171/2016.7.GKS161549,Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/pathology/*radiotherapy;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/instrumentation/*methods;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult,AED = antiepileptic drug;AUC = area under the curve;AVM = arteriovenous malformation;DSA = digital subtraction angiography;GKRS = Gamma Knife radiosurgery;Gamma Knife;ROC = receiver operating characteristic;SM = Spetzler-Martin;arteriovenous malformations;clinical outcome;hemorrhage;stereotactic radiosurgery;vascular disorders;volume
27903193,Three-dimensional assessment of the effects of high-density embolization material on the absorbed dose in the target for Gamma Knife radiosurgery of arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVE Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is an intracranial vascular disorder. Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) is used in conjunction with intraarterial embolization to eradicate the nidus of AVMs. Clinical results indicate that patients with prior embolization tend to gain less benefit from GKRS. The authors hypothesized that this was partly caused by dosimetric deficiency. The actual dose delivered to the target may be smaller than the intended dose because of increased photon attenuation by high-density embolic materials. The authors performed a phantom-based study to quantitatively evaluate the 3D dosimetric effect of embolic material on GKRS. METHODS A 16-cm-diameter and 12-cm-long cylindrical phantom with a 16-cm-diameter hemispherical dome was printed by a 3D printer. The phantom was filled with radiologically tissue-equivalent polymer gel. To simulate AVM treatment with embolization, phantoms contained Onyx 18. The material was injected into an AVM model, which was suspended in the polymer gel. The phantom was attached to a Leksell frame by standard GK fixation method, using aluminum screws, for imaging. The phantom was scanned by a Phillips CT scanner with the standard axial-scanning protocol (120 kV and 1.5-mm slice thickness). CT-based treatment planning was performed with the GammaPlan treatment planning system (version 10.1.1). The plan was created to cover a fictitious AVM target volume near the embolization areas with eleven 8-mm shots and a prescription dose of 20 Gy to 50% isodose level. Dose distributions were computed using both tissue maximum ratio (TMR) 10 and convolution dose-calculation algorithms. These two 3D dose distributions were compared using an in-house program. Additionally, the same analysis method was applied to evaluate the dosimetric effects for 2 patients previously treated by GKRS. RESULTS The phantom-based analyses showed that the mean dose difference between TMR 10 and convolution doses of the AVM target was no larger than 6%. The difference for GKRS cases was 5%. There were small areas where a large dose difference was observed on the isodose line plots, and those differences were mostly at or in the vicinity of the embolization materials. CONCLUSIONS The results of both the phantom and patient studies showed a dose reduction no larger than 5% due to the embolization material placed near the target. Although the comparison of 3D dose distributions indicated small local effects of the embolic material, the clinical impact on the obliteration rate is expected to be small.",2016 Dec,2016,Journal of neurosurgery,125,Suppl 1,123-128,eng,False,10.3171/2016.7.GKS161545,Journal Article,"Combined Modality Therapy;Embolization, Therapeutic/*methods;Humans;*Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnostic imaging/*therapy;Radiosurgery/*methods;Radiotherapy Dosage",AVM;AVM = arteriovenous malformation;GKRS = Gamma Knife radiosurgery;GammaPlan;NBCA = N-butyl cyanoacrylate;TMR 10;TMR = tissue maximum ratio;arteriovenous malformation;convolution;dosimetry;embolization;stereotactic radiosurgery

11013092,Treatment of arteriovenous malformation of the brain--preliminary experience.,"With the availability of new techniques, such as intravascular embolisation and radiosurgery, the therapeutic approach to arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the brain has recently been modified. The present study reports the authors, experiences in treating AVMs over the past 13 years. Spetzler-Martin grading of AVMs was I and II in 19 cases, III in 12, IV in 5 and V in 1 case. Four therapeutic regimens were utilised: surgical resection alone, embolisation and resection, and radiosurgery alone or after surgical resection. Generally, for low-grade AVMs (Spetzler-Martin grades I, II and III), the therapeutic choice was surgical resection in 27 cases, in combination with pre-operative embolisation in two of these patients. Two cases received radiotherapy only and one case received radiosurgery after embolisation, while one case was treated conservatively. Of the five cases of grade IV, four required surgical treatment, whereas the fifth case was treated conservatively. Favourable results (good recovery and moderate disability) were obtained in 96% of the low-grade AVMs as compared with the high-grade AVMs (66%) that had a poor outcome (due to primary brain damage resulting from haemorrhage at the onset in three cases and due to postoperative re-bleeding in one case). This report summarises preliminary experience in treating intracranial AVMs by surgical resection, intravascular embolisation and radiotherapy. Good therapeutic results can be expected by combining these therapeutic modalities.",2000 Sep,2000,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society,7 Suppl 1,,24-9,eng,False,S0967-5868(00)90705-7;10.1054/jocn.2000.0705,Case Reports;Journal Article;Review,"Adult;Child;*Embolization, Therapeutic/methods;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/*therapy;Male;*Microsurgery/methods;Radiography;*Radiosurgery/methods;Vascular Surgical Procedures",
19835467,Treatment of brain arteriovenous malformations with high-flow arteriovenous fistulas: risk and complications associated with endovascular embolization in multimodality treatment. Clinical article.,"OBJECT: High-flow fistulas associated with brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) pose a significant challenge to both stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and surgical treatment. The purpose of this study was to examine the outcomes of multimodality treatment of AVMs in association with a large arteriovenous fistula (AVF), with a special focus on endovascular embolization and its associated complications. METHODS: One hundred ninety-two patients harboring cerebral AVMs underwent endovascular treatment in the authors' department between 1997 and 2003. Of these, the authors selected 74 patients presenting with an AVM associated with high-flow AVF(s) for a retrospective analysis based on the findings of superselective angiography. After endovascular embolization, 32 patients underwent resection, 33 underwent either SRS or hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT), and 3 underwent both surgery and SRS. Six patients underwent embolization only. Immediate and midterm treatment outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Fifty-seven (77%) of the 74 patients had AVMs that were Spetzler-Martin Grade III or higher. A complete resection was achieved in all 32 patients. Of patients who underwent SRS/HSRT, 13 patients (39.3%) had either complete or > 90% obliteration of the AVM, and 2 patients (6.1%) had incomplete obliteration. Fourteen patients (42.4%) with residual AVM underwent repeated radiotherapy (and remain under observation). Of the 3 patients who underwent both SRS and resection, resection was complete in 2 and incomplete in one. No follow-up was obtained in 6 patients (8.1%). An endovascular complication was observed in 4 patients (5.4%). Fistula embolization was safely performed in every patient, whereas every endovascular complication was associated with other procedures such as nidus embolization. CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular occlusion of the fistulous component was successfully achieved in every patient; every endovascular complication in this series was related to other procedures such as nidus embolization. The importance of the fistula treatment should be emphasized to minimize the endovascular complications and to maximize the treatment effect when a multimodality therapy is used to treat brain AVMs with large AVF.",2010 Oct,2010,Journal of neurosurgery,113,4,715-22,eng,False,10.3171/2009.9.JNS081588;10.3171/2009.9.JNS081588,Journal Article,"Angiography, Digital Subtraction;Arteriovenous Fistula/radiotherapy/*surgery/*therapy;Cerebral Angiography;Combined Modality Therapy/adverse effects/*methods/mortality;Embolization, Therapeutic/adverse effects/*methods/mortality;Female;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/radiotherapy/*surgery/*therapy;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Neurosurgical Procedures;Radiosurgery/adverse effects/*methods/mortality;Risk;Tomography, X-Ray Computed;Treatment Outcome",
15183483,Radiation-induced changes of brain tissue after radiosurgery in patients with arteriovenous malformations: correlation with dose distribution parameters.,"PURPOSE: To investigate the correlation of radiation-induced changes of brain tissue after radiosurgery in patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) with treatment planning and dose distribution parameters. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The data from 73 AVM patients with complete follow-up information who underwent stereotactic linear accelerator radiosurgery at our institution between 1993 and 1998 were analyzed. Patients were treated with 11-14 noncoplanar fields shaped by a micromultileaf collimator. A median dose of 19 Gy (range, 13.3-22 Gy) was prescribed to the 80% isodose, which completely encompassed the target. Patients were followed at 3-month intervals the first year and then every 6 months with MRI and neurologic examinations. No patient developed radiation necrosis. The end point of radiation-induced tissue changes on follow-up neuroimaging (i.e., edema, blood-brain barrier breakdown [BBBB], and edema and/or BBBB combined) was evaluated. Each end point was further differentiated into four levels with respect to the extent of the image change (i.e., small, intermediate, large, and very large). The correlation of each end point was investigated for several treatment planning parameters, including prescribed dose and the absolute size of the AVM target volume. In addition, a number of dose-volume variables were calculated from each patient's dose distribution in the brain, including the mean dose to a specified volume of 16 and 20 cm(3) that was given the highest dose (Dmean16 and Dmean20, respectively), and the absolute and percentage of brain volume (including the AVM target) receiving a dose of at least 8, 10, and 12 Gy (V8-V12, and V8(rel)-V12(rel), respectively). These parameters were also determined excluding the AVM target volume from the considered volume (subscript ""excl""). The correlation of all treatment planning and dose-volume parameters with outcome was assessed in univariate Cox proportional hazards models. The results were assessed by p values (statistical significance for p < or =0.05), residual deviance (ResDev) of the fits, and odds ratios. RESULTS: The prescribed dose was not predictive of outcome (p >0.05 for all end points). The AVM target volume correlated significantly with large edema, as well as large edema and/or BBBB. V12 and Dmean20 were significantly associated with all end points, except very large edema and large BBBB. Patients with V12 of 27.6 cm(3) (Dmean20 of 18.9 Gy) had a 2.8-fold (fourfold) higher risk of developing edema and/or BBBB with large extent than those with V12 of 4.2 cm(3) (Dmean20 of 8.4 Gy). For all end points, V12(rel) correlated worse with outcome compared with V12 (e.g., end point of large edema and/or BBBB: ResDev = 85.8 and 86.5 for V12 and V12(rel), respectively). Excluding the AVM target volume from the considered irradiated volume led to only small changes in the resulting correlations (e.g., end point of small edema and/or BBBB: ResDev = 99.0 and 98.7 for V12 and V12(excl), respectively, and ResDev = 96.1 and 96.1 for Dmean20 and Dmean20(excl), respectively). Throughout the analysis, V8-V12, Dmean20, and Dmean16 yielded similar results and none of these parameters could be favored over the others. CONCLUSION: Radiation-induced changes of brain tissue after AVM radiosurgery can be well predicted by single dose distribution parameters that are a function of both dose and volume. These can be used to quantify dose-volume response relations. Studies of this nature will eventually help to improve our current understanding of the mechanisms leading to radiation-induced tissue changes after AVM radiosurgery and to optimize radiosurgery treatment planning.",2004 Jul 1,2004,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",59,3,796-808,eng,False,S0360301603023289;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2003.11.033,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Blood-Brain Barrier/radiation effects;Brain/*radiation effects;Brain Edema/etiology;Child;Child, Preschool;Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Radiation Injuries/*pathology;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects/instrumentation/methods;Radiotherapy Dosage",
26339954,Leksell Gamma Knife for pediatric and adolescent cerebral arteriovenous malformations: results of 100 cases followed up for at least 36 months.,"OBJECT: The goal of this study was to evaluate advantages, risks, and failures of Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) in a large series of pediatric and adolescent patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations (cAVMs) who were followed up for at least 36 months. METHODS: Since February 1993, 100 pediatric and adolescent patients (≤ 18 years of age) with cAVMs have undergone GKRS at the authors' institution and were followed up for at least 36 months. Forty-six patients were boys and 54 were girls; the mean age was 12.8 years (range 3-18 years). Hemorrhage, either alone or combined with seizure, was the clinical onset in 70% of cases. The mean pre-GK cAVM volume was 2.8 ml; 92% of cAVMs were Spetzler-Martin (S-M) Grades I-III. Most lesions (94%) were in eloquent or deep-seated brain regions, according to S-M classification. The parameters for mean and range in treatment planning were prescription isodose 53.8% (40%-90%); prescription dose (PD) 20.2 Gy (9.0-26.4 Gy); maximal dose (MD) 37.8 Gy (18-50 Gy); and number of shots 4.7 (1-17). On the day of GKRS, stereotactic CT or stereotactic MRI and digital subtraction angiography were used. RESULTS: Obliteration rate (OR) was angiographically documented in 75 of 84 cases (89.3%) after single-session GKRS, with actuarial ORs at 3 and 5 years of 68.0% and 88.1%, respectively. A repeat treatment was performed in 7 patients (6 with obliteration), and 16 patients with cAVMs underwent staged treatment (9 of them were angiographically cured). Thus, the overall OR was 90%, with actuarial ORs at 3, 5, and 8 years of 59.0%, 76.0%, and 85.0%, respectively. Permanent symptomatic GK-related complications were observed in 11% of cases, with surgical removal of enlarged mass seen on post-RS imaging needed in 5 cases. Hemorrhage during the latency period occurred in 9% of patients, but surgical evacuation of the hematoma was required in only 1 patient. One patient died due to rebleeding of a brainstem cAVM. Radiosurgery outcomes varied according to cAVM sizes and doses: volumes ≤ 10 ml and PDs > 16 Gy were significantly associated with higher ORs and lower rates of permanent complication and bleeding during the latency period. CONCLUSIONS: The data from this study reinforce the conclusion that GKRS is a safe and effective treatment for pediatric and adolescent cAVMs, yielding a high OR with minimal permanent severe morbidity and no mortality. The very low frequency of severe hemorrhages during the latency period further encourages a widespread application of RS in such patients. Univariate analysis found that modified RS-based cAVM score, nidus volume, PD, integral dose, S-M grade, and preplanned treatment (the last 2 parameters were also confirmed on multivariate analysis) significantly influenced OR. Lower S-M grades and single-session planned treatments correlated with shorter treatment obliteration interval on univariate analysis. This statistical analysis suggests that a staged radiosurgical treatment should be planned when nidus volume > 10 ml and/or when the recommended PD is ≤ 16 Gy.",2015 Dec,2015,Journal of neurosurgery.

METHODS: A group of ten consecutive children (four boys and six girls) irradiated between 2002 and 2010 at our institution was included into the study. The mean age at the time of treatment was 15.4 and ranged between 8 and 18 years. There were two Spetzler-Martin grade IV, four grade III, and four grade II lesions. Mean AVM volume was 13.2 cm(3) and varied from 0.6 to 36.8 cm(3). In five patients, the planned dose of 16-20 Gy was delivered in single fraction, in five the total dose of 16-24 Gy was delivered in two to three fractions. One patient was reirradiated with a dose of 15 Gy, 7 years after the initial treatment. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 38.5 months. The treatment resulted in total obliteration in eight patients and partial in one. The median time to obliteration was 22 months; actuarial total obliteration rates were 20, 54, 54, and 83 % after 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of follow-up, respectively. No patient bled after the treatment. In one patient, new epileptic seizures developed after the treatment; in magnetic resonance imaging, focal necrosis was revealed. In five patients, asymptomatic imaging abnormalities were seen during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic radiotherapy appears to be an effective method of treatment for pediatric AVMs, the patients however require meticulous follow-up because of relative high incidence of radiation-induced imaging abnormalities.",2013 Apr,2013,Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for,29,4,651-6,eng,False,10.1007/s00381-012-1983-6;1983;10.1007/s00381-012-1983-6,Journal Article,Adolescent;Child;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;Radiosurgery/instrumentation/*methods;Retreatment;*Stereotaxic Techniques;Treatment Outcome,
35276397,A Machine Learning Model Predicts the Outcome of SRS for Residual Arteriovenous Malformations after Partial Embolization: A Real-World Clinical Obstacle.,"OBJECTIVE: To propose a machine learning (ML) model predicting the favorable outcome of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for residual brain arteriovenous malformation (bAVM) after partial embolization. METHODS: One hundred and thirty bAVM patients who underwent partial embolization followed by SRS were reviewed retrospectively. Patients were split at random split into training datasets (n = 100) and testing datasets (n = 30). Radiomics and dosimetric features were extracted from pre-SRS treatment images. Feature selection was performed to select appropriate radiomics and dosimetric features. Three ML algorithms were applied to construct models using selected features respectively. A total of 9 models were trained to predict favorable outcomes (obliteration without complication) of bAVMs. The efficacy of these models was evaluated on the testing dataset using mean accuracy (ACC) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS: The obliteration rate of this cohort was 70.77% (92 of 130) with a mean follow-up of 43.8 months (range, 12-108 months). Favorable outcomes were achieved in 89 patients (68.46%). Four radiomics features and 7 dosimetric features were selected for ML model construction. The dosimetric support vector machines (SVM) model showed the best performance on the training dataset, with an ACC of 0.74 and AUC of 0.78. The dosimetric SVM model also showed the best performance on the testing dataset, with an ACC of 0.83 and AUC of 0.77. CONCLUSIONS: Dosimetric features are good predictors of prognosis for patients with partially embolized bAVM followed by SRS therapy. The use of ML models is an innovative method for predicting favorable outcomes of partially embolized bAVM followed by SRS therapy.",2022 Jul,2022,World neurosurgery,163,,e73-e82,eng,False,S1878-8750(22)00288-1;10.1016/j.wneu.2022.03.007;S1878-8750(22)00288-1;10.1016/j.wneu.2022.03.007,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Disease Progression;Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/diagnostic;Machine Learning;*Radiosurgery/methods;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome,Brain arteriovenous malformation;Endovascular embolization;Machine learning model;Radiomics;Stereotactic radiosurgery

METHODS: There were 41 continuous unselected patients. The mean follow-up period was 19 months; the mean age was 28 years; the male/female ratio was 2.2:1.0; the median prescription dose was 25 Gy (range 14-25 Gy); the median prescription isodose was 50%. The median lesion volume was 4.4 cm3. The median lesion coverage was 93%; and the mean conformity index was 1.22. The authors found no relationship between lesion volume or integral dose and the development of the clinical effects based on the adverse radiation effects (AREs); however, there was a significant relationship between both target volume and integral dose with the development of AREs as well as the severity of the AREs.

22173687,A historical analysis of single-stage γ knife radiosurgical treatment for large arteriovenous malformations: evolution and outcomes.,"BACKGROUND: Large arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) remain challenging and difficult to treat, reflected by evolving strategies developed from simple radiosurgical plans, to encompass embolization and, recently, staged volume treatments. To establish a baseline for future practice, we reviewed our clinical experience. METHOD: The outcomes for 492 patients (564 treatments) with AVMs >10 cm(3) treated by single-stage radiosurgery were retrospectively analysed in terms of planning, previous embolization and size. RESULTS: Twenty-eight percent of the patients presented with haemorrhage at a median age of 29 years (range: 2-75). From 1986 to 1993 (157 patients) plans were simplistic, based on angiography using a median of 2 isocentres and a marginal dose of 23 Gy covering 45-70% of the AVM (median volume 15.7 cm(3)). From 1994 to 2000 (225 patients) plans became more sophisticated, a median of 5 isocentres was used, covering 64-95% of the AVM (14.6 cm(3)), with a marginal dose of 21 Gy. Since 2000, MRI has been used with angiography to plan for 182 patients. Median isocentres increased to 7 with similar coverage (62-94%) of the AVM (14.3 cm(3)) and marginal dose of 21 Gy. Twenty-seven percent, 30% and 52% of patients achieved obliteration at 4 years, respectively. The proportion of prior embolization increased from 9% to 44% during the study. Excluding the embolized patients, improvement in planning increased obliteration rates from 28% to 36% and finally 63%. Improving treatment plans did not significantly decrease the rate of persisting radiation-induced side effects (12-16.5%). Complication rate rose with increasing size. One hundred and twenty-three patients underwent a second radiosurgical treatment, with a 64% obliteration rate, and mild and rare complications (6%). CONCLUSIONS: Better visualization of the nidus with multimodality imaging improved obliteration rates without changing morbidity. Our results support the view that prior embolization can make interpretation of the nidus more difficult, reducing obliteration rate. It will be important to see how results of staged volume radiosurgery compare with this historical material.",2012 Mar,2012,Acta neurochirurgica,154,3,383-94,eng,True,10.1007/s00701-011-1245-5;10.1007/s00701-011-1245-5,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Child;Child, Preschool;Embolization, Therapeutic/*methods;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/epidemiology/*surgery/*therapy;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/adverse effects/*methods;Reoperation/methods;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",

18506329,Radiosurgery with a linear accelerator in cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate results achieved with radiosurgery and complications of the procedure when treating arteriovenous malformations with linear accelerator. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted between October 1993 and December 1996. Sixty-one patients with arteriovenous malformations were treated with radiosurgery utilizing a 6MV energy linear accelerator. Ages of the 32 female and 29 male patients ranged from 6 to 54 years (mean: 28.3 years). The most frequent initial symptom was cephalea (45.9%), followed by neurological deficit (36.1%). Cerebral hemorrhage diagnosed by image was observed in 35 patients (57.3%). Most arteriovenous malformations (67.2%) were graded Spetzler III and IV. Venous stenosis (21.3%) and aneurysm (13.1%) were the most frequent angioarchitecture changes. The dose administered varied from 12 to 27.5Gy in the periphery of the lesion. RESULTS: Out of twenty-eight patients that underwent conclusive angiography control, complete obliteration was achieved in 18 (72%) and treatment failed in 7 (absence of occlusion with more than 3 years of follow-up). Four were submitted to a second radiosurgery, and one of these has shown obliteration after 18 months of follow-up. DISCUSSION: Several factors were analyzed regarding the occlusion rate (gender, age, volume, localization, Spetzler, flow, embolization, total of isocenters, prescribed dose and chosen isodose) and complications (total of isocenters, localization, volume, maximum dose, prescribed dose and chosen isodose). Analyzed variables showed no statistical significance for obliteration of the vessel, as well as for treatment complications. The largest diameter of the arteriovenous malformation, its volume and the dose administered did not influence time of obliteration. CONCLUSION: Radiosurgery is effective in the treatment of arteriovenous malformations and can be an alternative for patients with clinical contraindication or with lesions in eloquent areas. In the studied variables no statistically significant correlation was observed between occlusion and treatment complications.",2008 Mar-Apr,2008,Revista da Associacao Medica Brasileira (1992),54,2,167-72,eng,False,S0104-42302008000200023;10.1590/s0104-42302008000200023,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Cerebral Hemorrhage/diagnosis;Child;Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation;Epidemiologic Methods;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Angiography;Male;Middle Aged;*Particle Accelerators;Radiosurgery/adverse effects/*methods/mortality;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",

12459366,Cognitive function in patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations after radiosurgery: prospective long-term follow-up.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the long-term cognitive function of patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) after radiosurgery. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The data of 95 AVM patients were prospectively assessed up to 3 years after radiosurgery. Of these patients, 39 had a follow-up of at least 2 years. Radiosurgery was performed using a modified linear accelerator (minimal doses to the target volume 15-22 Gy, median dose 20). The neuropsychological evaluation included testing of intelligence, attention, and memory. The effect of a preexisting intracranial hemorrhage, as well as AVM occlusion, on cognitive functions was analyzed after 1 and 2 years. RESULTS: No cognitive declines were observed during follow-up. Instead significant improvements occurred in intelligence (1 year, +6.1 IQ points; 2 years, +5.1 IQ points), memory (1 year, +18.3 percentile score; 2 years, +12.2 percentile score), and attention (1 year, +19 percentile score; 2 years, +18 percentile score). Patients without previous intracranial hemorrhage improved more than patients with intracranial hemorrhage, although this difference was not statistically significant. The role of AVM occlusion on cognitive function is not clear at present.

21277103,Outcomes of diffusion tensor tractography-integrated stereotactic radiosurgery.,"PURPOSE: To analyze the effect of use of tractography of the critical brain white matter fibers created from diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging on reduction of morbidity associated with radiosurgery. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Tractography of the pyramidal tract has been integrated since February 2004 if lesions are adjacent to it, the optic radiation since May 2006, and the arcuate fasciculus since October 2007. By visually confirming the precise location of these fibers, the dose to these fiber tracts was optimized. One hundred forty-four consecutive patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations who underwent radiosurgery with this technique between February 2004 and December 2009 were analyzed. RESULTS: Tractography was prospectively integrated in 71 of 155 treatments for 144 patients. The pyramidal tract was visualized in 45, the optic radiation in 22, and the arcuate fasciculus in 13 (two tracts in 9). During the follow-up period of 3 to 72 months (median, 23 months) after the procedure, 1 patient showed permanent worsening of pre-existing dysesthesia, and another patient exhibited mild transient hemiparesis 12 months later but fully recovered after oral administration of corticosteroid agents. Two patients had transient speech disturbance before starting integration of the arcuate fasciculus tractography, but no patient thereafter.

30029956,Severe adverse radiation effects complicating radiosurgical treatment of brain arteriovenous malformations and the potential benefit of early surgical treatment.,"Treatment of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVM) with stereotactic radiosurgery is rarely complicated by severe adverse radiation effects (ARE). The treatment of these sequelae is varied and often ineffectual. We present three cases of brain AVMs treated with SRS, all complicated by severe AREs. All three cases failed to respond to what is currently considered the standard treatment - corticosteroids - and indeed one patient died as a result of the side effects of their extended use. Two cases were successfully treated with surgical excision of the necrotic lesion resulting in immediate clinical improvement. Having considered the experience described in this paper and reviewed the published literature to date we suggest that surgical treatment of AREs should be considered early in the management of this condition should steroid therapy not result in early improvement.",2018 Sep,2018,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society,55,,25-31,eng,False,S0967-5868(18)30472-7;10.1016/j.jocn.2018.06.027;S0967-5868(18)30472-7;10.1016/j.jocn.2018.06.027,Case Reports;Journal Article,Adolescent;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*radiotherapy;Male;Middle Aged;Radiation Injuries/*pathology/*therapy;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects/methods;Treatment Outcome,AVM;Adverse radiation effects;Cerebral arteriovenous malformations;Haemorrhage;Neurosurgery;Radiation necrosis;Radiosurgery

23968165,Robotic radiosurgery versus micro-multileaf collimator: a dosimetric comparison for large or critically located arteriovenous malformations.,"BACKGROUND: Stereotactic irradiation of large or critically located arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is a special challenge for clinicians and radiation physicists. To date, no comprehensive comparison of two linac-based radiosurgery systems used for hypofractionated radiotherapy of large AVMs was published. The aim of the study was to compare dose distributions between CyberKnife (CK) system and linac with a micro-multileaf collimator (L-mMLC) in high-grade or critically located cerebral AVMs. METHODS: Two sets of plans made for 15 different patients with at least 95% target coverage were selected for comparisons. Conformity (CI), homogeneity (HI) and gradient score (GSI) indices, conformity index proposed by Lomax (CIL), conformation number (CN), quality of coverage (Q), volumes of brain receiving 12,10,8,6,4, and 2 Gy, minimum and maximum doses for critical structures in both treatment planning systems (TPS) were compared. Finally, the number of monitor units needed to deliver the prescribed dose was compared. RESULTS: The mean minimum doses in the target volume were 93.3% (CK) and 90.7% (L-mMLC),p=n.s, maximum: 119.7 and 110%, respectively (p=0.004). The mean CI was 1.46 and 1.86, HI: 1.2, and 1.11, CIL 0.7, and 0.6, CN: 0.68 and 0.58 for CK and mMLC, respectively (p<0.05). The values of GSI and Q were not significantly different. The volumes of the brain receiving low doses (4 Gy and 2 Gy) were significantly lower in the CK system. The number of monitor units necessary to deliver the prescribed dose was significantly greater in case of the CK system. CONCLUSIONS: Better conformity can favor the CK system for treatment of large AVMs at the cost of higher maximum doses and worse homogeneity. L-mMLC is superior when shorter treatment time is required. Neither system can assure satisfying dose gradients outside large targets surrounded by numerous critical structures.",2013 Aug 23,2013,"Radiation oncology (London, England)",8,,205,eng,False,10.1186/1748-717X-8-205;1748-717X-8-205;10.1186/1748-717X-8-205,Comparative Study;Journal Article,"Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Organs at Risk;Radiometry;Radiosurgery/*methods;Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted;Robotic Surgical Procedures/*methods",

11071447,Volume measurement of cerebral arteriovenous malformations from angiography.,"We designed software for measuring the volume of cerebral arteriovenous malformations from angiography and validated it against prescription volumes in radiosurgery. We aimed to create a model for the risk for complications as a function of volume, based on established outcome prediction models for Gamma Knife radiosurgery, but without the need for dose planning. We created an application for computing the volume of cerebral arteriovenous malformations from the intersection of two X-ray cones in stereotactic space. Volume measurements were compared with prescription volumes from dose planning, in phantoms and in patients treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations. Previous studies of 1128 treated patients were used to calculate the risk for complication as a function of the nidus volume. In 63 patients volumes measured with either method correlated, R2 = 0.85. Volume as measured with the intersecting cone model (ICM) correlated with predicted Gamma Knife radiosurgery complication rate, R2 = 0.84. The ICM can thus be used for measurement of AVM volumes less than 10 cm3 from angiography. Outcome models from Gamma Knife radiosurgery may be applied, but with reduced exactness. Standardised AVM volume measurement is valuable for comparing outcome and for quantification of volume reduction after therapy, notably embolisation. Thus the optimal management plan may be selected in conjunction with diagnostic or therapeutic angiography.",2000 Sep,2000,Neuroradiology,42,9,697-702,eng,False,10.1007/s002340000374,Journal Article,"Cerebral Angiography/*methods;Embolization, Therapeutic/methods;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnosis/*therapy;Radiosurgery/methods;Software;Treatment Outcome",

OBJECTIVE: To report our experience with single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for Spetzler-Martin Grade I-II AVM. METHODS: A prospectively maintained registry was reviewed for patients with nonsyndromic Spetzler-Martin Grade I-II AVM having SRS from 1990 to 2011. Patients with <24 mo of follow-up or prior radiotherapy/SRS were excluded, resulting in a study population of 173 patients. Actuarial analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox proportional hazards modeling was performed with excellent outcomes (obliteration without new deficits) as the dependent variable. RESULTS: Median post-SRS follow-up was 68 mo (range, 24-275). AVM obliteration was achieved in 132 (76%) after initial SRS. Eleven additional patients achieved obliteration after repeat SRS for an overall obliteration rate of 83%. The rate of obliteration was 60% at 4 yr and 78% at 8 yr. Post-SRS hemorrhage occurred in 7 patients (4%), resulting in 3 minor deficits (2%) and 1 death (<1%). Radiation-induced complications occurred in 5 patients (3%), resulting in minor deficits only. One hundred and thirty-seven patients (79%) had excellent outcomes at last follow-up. CONCLUSION: SRS is a safe and effective treatment for patients with Spetzler-Martin Grade I-II AVM.

16955037,Outcomes of surgery for resection of regions of symptomatic radiation injury after stereotactic radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVE: Although radiation injury after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), including radiation necrosis (RN), is often treated with surgical resection, detailed outcome data are lacking after resection of symptomatic radiation-injured regions with imaging characteristics suspicious for RN after SRS for arteriovenous malformations (AVM). We present outcomes in seven such patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of seven patients with AVMs of Spetzler-Martin Grades II (n = 1), III (n = 2), and IV (n = 4) who underwent helium ion, proton beam, or gamma knife SRS and required resection of RN-suspicious tissue 1 to 24 months after post-SRS symptom onset. Postoperative outcomes included Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score and time to symptomatic improvement. RESULTS: Symptomatic improvement required at least 9 months in the three patients with large regions suspicious for RN (>or=4 cm), whereas of four patients with smaller regions (<4 cm), three showed improvement within 2 months (P < 0.05). The remaining patient, who showed no benefit, underwent resection 2 years after the onset of RN symptoms (compared with <or= 8 mo for the other six patients). Surgery improved KPS scores in four patients with a preoperative KPS score of 50 or lower, but not in three patients with preoperative KPS scores greater than 70 (P < 0.05). Outcomes were not consistently associated with AVM size or location, SRS treatment volume or dose, associated aneurysm, or residual AVM. CONCLUSION: After SRS for AVMs, resection of symptomatic RN-suspicious tissue areas is beneficial in reversing neurological deficits and improving KPS scores in selected patients. Times to improvement were longer when larger areas were resected. Delaying such surgery after symptom onset may negatively affect improvement.",2006 Sep,2006,Neurosurgery,59,3,553-60; discussion 553-60,eng,False,00006123-200609000-00007;10.1227/01.NEU.0000227476.95859.F1,"Comparative Study;Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Adult;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Radiation Injuries/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Radiography;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects/methods;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome,

For more than 20,000 patients worldwide, angiography under stereotactic conditions has been the main imaging modality for defining and targeting the AVM nidus. The role of angulation of the X-ray tube for angiographic localization of the AVM during stereotactic Gamma Knife radiosurgery was studied with a phantom.

The skill of the neurosurgeon in operating on AVMs is now being compared with that of the gamma-knife. The decision varies from case to case and is to be taken by the neurosurgeon. This report presents three cases in which such decision making was not easy. Case 1 was a non-ruptured cingulate AVM of 2.5 cm diameter in the cingulate cortex. The operative field was anticipated to be very narrow between the parietal bridging veins. Case 2 was a tiny ruptured AVM in the speech-motor area which was buried underneath the cortex. Case 3 was a large ruptured thalamo-stiriate-capsular AVM with feeders from the anterior and posterior choroidal arteries. All cases were operated without serious morbidity. A combination of pre-operative intravascular surgery (cases 1 and 3) or postoperative gamma-knife (case 3) was adopted. In conclusion, there is no unitary rule to decide on surgery or gamma-knife for the treatment of AVMs. It depends on what good or harm the responsible surgeon or the gamma-knife does.",2000 Sep,2000,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society,7 Suppl 1,,19-23,eng,False,S0967586800907045;10.1054/jocn.2000.0704,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Adult;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;*Radiosurgery/methods;Tomography, X-Ray Computed;Vascular Surgical Procedures/methods",

A substitute to volume fractionation.,"BACKGROUND: To evaluate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of dose fractionated gamma knife radiosurgery (DFGKRS) on a daily schedule beyond the linear quadratic (LQ) model, for large volume arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 2012-16, 14 patients of large AVMs (median volume 26.5 cc) unsuitable for surgery or embolization were treated in 2-3 of DFGKRS sessions. The Leksell G frame was kept in situ during the whole procedure. 86% (n = 12) patients had radiologic evidence of bleed, and 43% (n = 6) had presented with a history of seizures. 57% (n = 8) patients received a daily treatment for 3 days and 43% (n = 6) were on an alternate day (2 fractions) regimen. The marginal dose was split into 2 or 3 fractions of the ideal prescription dose of a single fraction of 23-25 Gy. RESULTS: The median follow up period was 35.6 months (8-57 months). In the three-fraction scheme, the marginal dose ranged from 8.9-11.5 Gy, while in the two-fraction scheme, the marginal dose ranged from 11.3-15 Gy at 50% per fraction. Headache (43%, n = 6) was the most common early postoperative complication, which was controlled with short course steroids. Follow up evaluation of at least three years was achieved in seven patients, who have shown complete nidus obliteration in 43% patients while the obliteration has been in the range of 50-99% in rest of the patients. Overall, there was a 67.8% reduction in the AVM volume at 3 years. Nidus obliteration at 3 years showed a significant rank order correlation with the cumulative prescription dose (p 0.95, P value 0.01), with attainment of near-total (more than 95%) obliteration rates beyond 29 Gy of the cumulative prescription dose. No patient receiving a cumulative prescription dose of less than 31 Gy had any severe adverse reaction. In co-variate adjusted ordinal regression, only the cumulative prescription dose had a significant correlation with common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) severity (P value 0.04), independent of age, AVM volume, number of fractions and volume of brain receiving atleast 8 Gy of radiation. CONCLUSION: DFGKRS is feasible for large AVMs with a fair nidus obliteration rate and acceptable toxicity. Cumulative prescription dose seems to be the most significant independent predictor for outcome following DFGKRS with 29-30 Gy resulting in a fair nidus obliteration with least adverse events.",2017 Jul-Aug,2017,Neurology India,65,4,826-835,eng,False,10.4103/neuroindia.NI_220_17;ni_2017_65_4_826_209499;10.4103/neuroindia.NI_220_17,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological;Appointments and Schedules;Bevacizumab/therapeutic use;Combined Modality Therapy;Feasibility Studies;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/diagnostic;Male;Middle Aged;Models, Organizational;Neurosurgery/*organization & administration;Postoperative Complications/epidemiology/therapy;Prospective Studies;*Radiation Dosage;Radiosurgery/*methods/standards;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",
30922905,"Long-Term Outcomes for Pediatric Patients with Brain Arteriovenous Malformations Treated with Gamma Knife Radiosurgery, Part 2: The Incidence of Cyst Formation, Encapsulated Hematoma, and Radiation-Induced Tumor.","OBJECTIVE: Long-term data about the incidence of late adverse radiation effects (AREs) in pediatric brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) are lacking. This study addresses the incidence of late AREs, including cyst formation (CF), chronic encapsulated hematoma (CEH), and radiation-induced tumor, in pediatric patients with AVM treated with GKRS. METHODS: This is a single-institutional study involving pediatric patients with AVM who underwent GKRS between 1991 and 2014. Among 201 pediatric patients with AVM (age ≤15 years), 189 who had at least 12 months of follow-up were assessed in this study. The median treatment volume was 2.2 cm(3), and the median marginal dose was 20 Gy. RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 136 months. During the follow-up period, symptomatic radiation-induced perilesional edema was found in 5 patients (3%), CFs in 7 patients (4%), CEHs in 7 patients (4%), and radiation-induced tumors in 2 patients (1%). The cumulative incidences of late AREs including CF, CEH, and radiation-induced tumor were 1.2% at 5 years, 5.2% at 8 years, 6.1% at 10 years, 7.2% at 15 years, and 17.0% at 20 years. In the multivariate analysis, treatment volume alone was a significant factor for late AREs (P < 0.001; hazard ratio, 1.111). CONCLUSIONS: GKRS is a reasonable treatment option for pediatric AVMs to prevent future intracranial hemorrhages, particularly in the eloquent regions.

23205801,Proposed mechanism for cyst formation and enlargement following Gamma Knife Surgery for arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECT: The authors retrospectively studied the mechanism of cyst formation and enlargement after Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) for arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). METHODS: Eighteen patients in whom cyst formation developed following GKS for AVM were retrospectively identified among 775 patients who underwent GKS for AVM at Yokohama Rosai Hospital. The study group was composed of 12 male and 6 female patients ranging in age from 17 to 47 years. RESULTS: Chronic encapsulated expanding hematoma was associated with the cyst in 5 patients. The AVM nidus volume at the time of GKS ranged from 1.9 to 36 cm(3), and the prescription radiation dose was 18-25 Gy. Complete obliteration of the AVM nidus was obtained in 13 patients and partial obliteration in 5 patients. Cyst formation was detected between 2.6 and 15 years after GKS. Craniotomy was performed in 10 patients, including 2 patients in whom the incompletely obliterated nidus was removed at the same time, and an Ommaya reservoir was placed in 2 patients. Spontaneous regression of the cyst was observed in 1 patient. Serial MR imaging was performed in the other patients because the size of the cyst was stable or the lesion was asymptomatic. Histological examination of the cyst wall revealed linear hemosiderin deposits with gliosis.

21296440,Repeated linac-based radiosurgery in high-grade cerebral arteriovenous-malformations (AVM) Spetzler-Martin grade III to IV previously treated with radiosurgery.,"BACKGROUND: Aim was to access outcome and toxicity of repeated linac-based radiosurgery in incompletely obliterated cerebral AVM. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1998 and 2008, 11 patients were treated with repeated radiosurgery. The median dose to the 80%-isodose was 15 Gy (range, 12-18 Gy). During initial radiosurgery the median dose was 18 Gy (range, 9-22 Gy). RESULTS: The median time interval between initial radiosurgery and re-treatment was 9 years (range, 4-16 years). The median follow-up was 26 months (range, 2-115 months). Treatment response was seen in 8 patients (89%). Complete (partial) obliteration was achieved in 5 (3) patients (56%, 33%, respectively).The median time to complete obliteration was 26 months (range, 5-45 months). Pre-existing neurological symptoms improved in 2 patients (18%), were stable in 7 patients (64%) and worsened in 2 patients (18%). Prevalence of intracranial hemorrhage was 9% (1/11). Post-re-treatment intracranial hemorrhage rate was 2.7% (1/38 years at risk). During follow-up, no secondary malignancies or toxicity>grade III were observed.

11404705,[Cerebral arteriovenous malformations treated by radiosurgery: a series of 705 cases].,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: After a review of the main radiosurgical published series, to evaluate our own series of 705 patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations treated by radiosurgery alone or in combination with embolization or surgery. PATIENTS: and method. From January 1984 to December 1998, 705 patients were treated by a multidisciplinary team including neurosurgeons, neuroradiologists, radiophysicians and radiotherapists. Age of revelation of the cerebral arteriovenous malformations ranged between birth to 73 years (mean 27, median 25). Age at time of radiosurgery ranged between 7 and 75 years (mean 33, median 31). There were 410 males for 295 females (sex- ratio 1.4). Symptoms of revelation were hemorrhage for 59%, seizures for 23%, headaches for 14% and progressive deficits for 4%. Discovery of cerebral arteriovenous malformation was fortuitous in 4% of cases. Repartition following Spetzler's grading was 12% in grade I, 36% in grade II, 40% in grade III, 12% in grade IV and 0% in grade V. Maximal size ranged between 4 and 60 mm (mean 23, median 20). Volume ranged between 0.2 and 24.3 cc (mean 3.8, median 2.8). Majority of cerebral arteriovenous malformations were large size (42% with size higher than 25 mm) and large volume (54% higher than 10 cc. 54% of patients had treatment prior radiosurgery: 38% had embolization, 10% were operated, 4% were treated by radiosurgery (reirradiation) and 3% were operated and embolized. RESULTS: Overall complete obliteration rate was 55%. The obliteration rate was correlated with size (77% for cAVMs lower than 15 mm, 62% for cerebral arteriovenous malformations between 15 and 25 mm, and 44% for cerebral arteriovenous malformations higher than 25 mm), with volume (94% for cerebral arteriovenous malformations lower than 1 cc, 64% between 1 and 4 cc, 48% between 4 and 10 cc, and 62% for cerebral arteriovenous malformations higher than 10 cc), dose at reference isodose, minimal dose, morphological parameters (presence of dural components, arteriolovenous fistula, plexiform angioarchitecture, arterial steal, arterial recruitment, deep exclusive drainage, venous plicature, venous confluence, venous ectasia, venous reflux), sectional topography and good recovery of the target. Embolization was a confusion factor not associated with obliteration rate. After multivariate analysis, only Dmin and complete coverage of the cerebral arteriovenous malformations were correlated with obliteration rate. Delay of obliteration was significantly correlated after multivariate analysis with Dmin, complete coverage, arteriolovenulary angioarchitecture (positive correlation) and venous ectasia (negative correlation). CONCLUSION: Overall complete obliteration rate is unreliable data to assess efficacy of radiosurgical method in the tretment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations. The obliteration rate must be interpretated after stratification on several morphological and dosimetric parameters.",2001 May,2001,Neuro-Chirurgie,47,2-3 Pt 2,268-82,fre,False,75784,Comparative Study;Evaluation Study;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Age Factors;Aged;Cerebral Angiography;Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology;Child;Epilepsy/etiology;Female;Heavy Ion Radiotherapy;Humans;Intracranial Aneurysm/diagnostic imaging/surgery;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/pathology/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Paris/epidemiology;Particle Accelerators;Radiation Injuries/etiology;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects/instrumentation/methods/mortality;Radiotherapy Dosage;Retrospective Studies;Sex Factors;Shock, Septic/etiology;Treatment Outcome",
11316570,3D reconstruction of the encapsulating contour of arteriovenous malformations for radiosurgery using digital subtraction angiography.,"PURPOSE: Treatment planning for radiosurgery depends on the precise definition of radiation target volumes. For vascular pathologies such as arteriovenous malformations (AVM), the most usual technique remains standard X-ray projection imaging, most often carried out under stereotactic conditions. To further benefit from the advantages of two-dimensional digital subtraction angiography (DSA), the authors have developed a method for determining the three-dimensional shape of arteriovenous malformations from two views. METHODS AND MATERIALS: After correction of image intensifier distortion and calibration of both views, the 3D shape of the AVM was determined from two DSA projections using epipolarity geometry. The AVM-encapsulating contour was modeled by triangulation of a stack of almost parallel ellipses. The method was technically validated using artificial targets in a skull phantom. Clinical validation was carried out on 10 patients who were examined using both conventional angiography under stereotactic conditions (SX-ray) and DSA. RESULTS: There was excellent agreement between the artificial target volumes measured with SX-ray and with DSA. The correspondence between AVM volumes found for patients was not as good as with the phantom. CONCLUSIONS: The different image characteristics of the two modalities lead to some differences in AVM estimations. However, the results were sufficiently satisfactory to justify routine use of this AVM modeling technique for radiosurgery planning.",2001 May 1,2001,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",50,1,247-55,eng,False,S0360-3016(01)01441-9;10.1016/s0360-3016(01)01441-9,"Clinical Trial;Comparative Study;Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Angiography, Digital Subtraction/*methods;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnostic imaging/pathology/*surgery;Models, Biological;Phantoms, Imaging;Radiosurgery/instrumentation/*methods;Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted/instrumentation/*methods;Reproducibility of Results",

10725625,Combining stereotactic angiography and 3D time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography in treatment planning for arteriovenous malformation radiosurgery.,"PURPOSE: This study was initiated to evaluate the advantages of using three-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (3D TOF MRA), as an adjuvant to conventional stereotactic angiography, in obtaining three-dimensional information about an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) nidus and in optimizing radiosurgical treatment plans. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Following angiography, contrast-enhanced MRI and MRA studies were obtained in 22 consecutive patients undergoing Gamma Knife radiosurgery for AVM. A treatment plan was designed, based on the angiograms and modified as necessary, using the information provided by MRA. The quantitative analysis involved calculation of the ratio of the treated volume to the MRA nidus volume (the tissue volume ratio [TVR]) for the initial and final treatment plans. RESULTS: In 12 cases (55%), the initial treatment plans were modified after including the MRA information in the treatment planning process. The mean TVR for the angiogram-based plans was 1.63 (range 1.17-2.17). The mean coverage of the MRA nidus by the angiogram-based plans was 93% (range 73-99%). The mean MRA nidus volume was 2.4 cc (range 0. 6-5.3 cc). The MRA-based modifications resulted in increased conformity with the mean TVR of 1.46 (range 1.20-1.74). These modifications were caused by MRA revealing irregular nidi and/or vascular components superimposed on the angiographic projections of the nidi. In a number of cases, the information from MRA was essential in defining the nidus when the projections of the angiographic outlines showed different superior and/or inferior extent of the nidus. In two cases, MRA revealed irregular nidi, correlating well with the angiograms and showed that the angiographically acceptable plans undertreated 27% of the MRA nidus in one case and 18% of the nidus in the other case. In the remaining 10 cases (45%), both MRI and MRA failed to detect the nidus due to surgical clip artifacts and the presence of embolizing glue. CONCLUSIONS: The 3D TOF MRA provided information on irregular AVM shape, which was not visualized by angiography alone, and it was superior to MRI for defining the AVM nidus. However, when imaging artifacts obscured the AVM nidus on MRI and MRA, angiography permitted detection of AVM. Utilizing MRA as a complementary imaging modality to angiography increased accuracy of the AVM radiosurgery and allowed for optimal dose planning.",2000 Mar 15,2000,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",46,5,1149-54,eng,False,S0360301699005301;10.1016/s0360-3016(99)00530-1,Journal Article,Cerebral Angiography/*methods;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Angiography/*methods;Radiosurgery/*methods,

METHODS: A series of 97 microsurgically resected unruptured brain AVM was analyzed in terms of postoperative morbidity and lifetime loss of quality-adjusted life-years (QALY). For comparison, the natural risk of becoming disabled was modeled on the basis of published data. RESULTS: Discharge morbidity was recorded in 11 of the 69 of Spetzler-Martin (SM) grade 1 and 2 AVMs (16 %), eight of 22 (36 %) grade 3, and four of six grade 4 (67 %), permanent morbidity >mRS 1 in 3 (4.3 %) grade 1 and 2, four (18 %) grade 3, and three (50 %) grade 4. Treatment inflicted loss of QALY amounted to 0.5 years for SM grade 1-2, 2.5 years grade 3, 7.3 years for grade 4. For the SM grades 1 and 2, the treatment-related loss of 0.5 QALY was met by the natural course after 2.7-4.3 years. For the Spetzler-Martin grades 3 and 4, the treatment-induced loss QALY was not met by the natural risk within a foreseeable time. Permanent morbidity and treatment inflicted loss of QALY of patients younger than 39 years was lower than that of older patients (7 vs. 15 % and 1.0 vs. 2.1 QALY). CONCLUSIONS: Microsurgically managed SM grades 1 and 2 fared better than the modeled natural course but grades 3 and 4 AVM did not benefit from surgery.

21279394,"Contribution of technological progress, inter-operator difference and experience of operators in Gamma Knife radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformation.","BACKGROUND: Outcomes of microsurgical resection for cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) largely depend on the skill and experience of the operator, but it is still unknown whether such individual differences similarly exists in stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for AVM. The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of the inter-operator difference and technological progress in SRS for AVM. METHODS: During the past 20 years, 514 patients with AVM were treated by SRS by four neurosurgeons. Until 1992, angiography was solely used for dose planning, and computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was jointly used thereafter. In the early years, dose planning was calculated with the first-generation computer system, KULA, and manually superimposed on the radiographical images. After 1998, treatment planning was made on the computer monitor with sophisticated dose-planning software, GammaPlan. The influence of inter-operator difference, the operator's experience, and radiographical or radiosurgical technologies on the rates of obliteration and morbidity was assessed by multivariate analyses. RESULTS: The factors associated with higher obliteration rates were higher margin dose (p = 0.003) and the presence of hemorrhagic event before SRS (p = 0.002). There was no significant difference in either obliteration rate or morbidity among the five operators. However, after introduction of CT and MRI on dose planning, the risk of adverse events was significantly decreased. Especially for AVM larger than 3 cm in maximum diameter, each operator's experience (p = 0.040) and use of GammaPlan (p = 0.015) reduced morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Inter-operator difference was not a significant factor associated with the rates of obliteration and the risk of adverse events after SRS for AVM in the multivariate analyses. Progress of the sophisticated planning software and the experience of the operator were associated with lower morbidity for larger lesions.",2011 Apr,2011,Acta neurochirurgica,153,4,879-82,eng,True,10.1007/s00701-011-0946-0;10.1007/s00701-011-0946-0,Comparative Study;Journal Article,"*Clinical Competence;*Diffusion of Innovation;Education, Medical, Continuing;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/*surgery;Japan;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Multivariate Analysis;Neuronavigation/education/*trends;Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care/statistics & numerical data;Radiosurgery/education/*trends;Retrospective Studies;Robotics/trends;Software;Tomography, X-Ray Computed;Treatment Outcome",

Thin-slice MRI acquired for treatment planning did not show the AVM nidus. The patient was brought back to the angiography suite for high-resolution contrast-enhanced cone beam CT (VasoCT) acquired using an angiographic c-arm system. The lesion and nidus were visualized with VasoCT. MRI, CT and VasoCT data were transferred to radiation planning software and mutually co-registered. The nidus was annotated for radiation on VasoCT data by an experienced neurointerventional radiologist and a dose/treatment plan was completed.

19398883,Radiosurgical treatment planning for intracranial AVM based on images generated by principal component analysis--a simulation study.,"BACKGROUND: One of the most important factors in stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for intracranial arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is to determine accurate target delineation of the nidus. However, since intracranial AVMs are complicated in structure, it is often difficult to clearly determine the target delineation. PURPOSE: To investigate the usefulness of principal component analysis (PCA) on intra-arterial contrast enhanced dynamic CT (IADCT) images as a tool for delineating accurate target volumes for stereotactic radiosurgery of AVMs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: IADCT and intravenous contrast-enhanced CT (IVCT) were used to examine 4 randomly selected cases of AVM. PCA images were generated from the IADCT data. The first component images were considered feeding artery predominant, the second component images were considered draining vein predominant, and the third component images were considered background. Target delineations were first carried out from IVCT, and then again while referring to the first and second components of the PCA images. Dose calculation simulations for radiosurgical treatment plans with IVCT and PCA images were performed. Dose volume histograms of the vein areas as well as the target volumes were compared. RESULTS: In all cases, the calculated target volumes based on IVCT images were larger than those based on PCA images, and the irradiation doses for the vein areas were reduced. CONCLUSION: In this study, we simulated radiosurgical treatment planning for intracranial AVM based on PCA images. By using PCA images, the irradiation doses for the vein areas were substantially reduced.",2009 Mar,2009,The Keio journal of medicine,58,1,41-9,eng,False,10.2302/kjm.58.41,Journal Article,"Adult;Angiography;Child;Computer Simulation;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*pathology/*surgery;Middle Aged;*Principal Component Analysis;Radiosurgery/*methods;Tomography, X-Ray Computed",

Recent insights, however, suggest that these lesions may be secondary to a vascular insult such as ischemia or trauma. Herein, the authors present a rare case of a secondary cerebral AVM, occurring in a young girl who received prior cranial radiation therapy. At age 3years, she underwent surgical resection, chemotherapy, and photon radiation therapy for treatment of a fourth ventricular ependymoma. At age 19years, she developed new onset seizures and was found to have a left medial temporal lobe AVM. Her seizures were managed successfully with anti-epileptic medications and the AVM was treated with proton radiation therapy.

11020579,The rationale and technique of staged-volume arteriovenous malformation radiosurgery.,"PURPOSE: Stereotactic radiosurgery is an effective management strategy for properly selected arteriovenous malformation (AVM) patients. However, the risk of postradiosurgical radiation-related injury generally limits this procedure to patients with AVMs of an average diameter of 3 cm or less. Radiosurgery of large AVMs in a planned staged fashion was undertaken to limit the radiation exposure to the surrounding normal brain. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between April 1997 and December 1999, 10 patients with a median AVM volume of 17.4 cm(3) (range, 7.4-53.3 cm(3)) underwent staged-volume radiosurgery (23 procedures). At the first radiosurgical procedure, the total volume of the AVM is estimated and a dose plan calculated that covers 10 cm(3)-15 cm(3), or one-half the nidus volume if the AVM is critically located (brainstem, thalamus, or basal ganglia). At 6-month intervals thereafter, radiosurgery was repeated to different portions of the AVM with the previous dose plan(s) being re-created utilizing intracranial landmarks to minimize radiation overlap. Radiosurgical procedures were continued until the entire malformation has been irradiated. RESULTS: The radiation dosimetry of staged-volume AVM radiosurgery was compared to hypothetical single-session procedures for the 10 patients. Staged-volume radiosurgery decreased the 12-Gy volume by an average of 11.1% (range, 4.9-21%) (p < 0.001). The non-AVM 12-Gy volume was reduced by an average of 27.2% (range, 12.5-51.3%) (p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: Staged-volume radiosurgery of large AVMs results in less radiation exposure to the adjacent brain. Further follow-up is needed to determine whether this technique provides a high rate of AVM obliteration while maintaining an acceptable rate of radiation-related complications.",2000 Oct 1,2000,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",48,3,817-24,eng,False,S0360-3016(00)00696-9;10.1016/s0360-3016(00)00696-9,Case Reports;Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/pathology/*surgery;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/*methods;Reoperation;Time Factors,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We studied 9 patients who had undergone 10 staged GK sessions for large arteriovenous malformations. Each patient had fiducials surgically implanted in the outer table of the skull at the first GK treatment. These markers were imaged on orthogonal radiographs, which were scanned into the GK planning system. For the same patients, 8-10 pairs of internal landmarks were retrospectively identified on the three-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance imaging studies that had been obtained for treatment. The coordinate transformation between the stereotactic frame space for subsequent treatment sessions was then determined by point matching, using four surgically embedded fiducials and then using four pairs of internal anatomic landmarks. In both cases, the transformation was ascertained by minimizing the chi-square difference between the actual and the transformed coordinates. Both transformations were then evaluated using the remaining four to six pairs of internal landmarks as the test points. RESULTS: Averaged over all treatment sessions, the root mean square discrepancy between the coordinates of the transformed and actual test points was 1.2 +/- 0.2 mm using internal landmarks and 1.7 +/- 0.4 mm using the surgically implanted fiducials. CONCLUSION: The results of this study have shown that using internal landmarks to determine the coordinate transformation between subsequent magnetic resonance imaging scans for volume-staged GK arteriovenous malformation treatment sessions is as accurate as using surgically implanted fiducials and avoids an invasive procedure.",2007 Apr 1,2007,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",67,5,1578-85,eng,False,S0360-3016(06)03644-3;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2006.12.026,Journal Article,Algorithms;Brain/*anatomy & histology;Chi-Square Distribution;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;*Prostheses and Implants;Radiography;Radiosurgery/*methods,

18291487,Combined management of intracranial arteriovenous malformations with embolization and gamma knife radiosurgery: comparative evaluation of the long-term results.,"BACKGROUND: Volume reduction of large AVMs attained with endovascular embolization can be potentially helpful for their subsequent radiosurgical management. The objective of the present retrospective analysis was comparative evaluation of the long-term outcome after GKR for intracranial AVM performed with and without initial embolization of the nidus. METHODS: The long-term outcome in 15 patients with intracranial AVM treated with initial embolization and subsequent GKR was evaluated and compared with the series of 237 patients treated during the same period solely with GKR. All patients were followed at least 2 years after radiosurgery. RESULTS: Mean reductions of the nidus volume and score of the radiosurgery-based grading system for AVMs after embolization constituted 6.9 +/- 2.4 mL and 0.7 +/- 0.2, respectively (P < .001). Complete obliteration of the nidus after GKR was marked in 10 cases (67%). It was attained in 9 (90%) of 10 AVMs with postembolization nidus volume less than 12 mL, and in 1 (20%) of 5 with postembolization nidus volume more than 12 mL (P < .05). Delayed cyst formation was met once (7%). Obliteration and long-term morbidity rates did not differ significantly in patients treated with and without preradiosurgical nidus embolization, whereas nidus volume was seemingly larger in the former cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Combined management with embolization and GKR may be effective for selected cases of large intracranial AVM.

11740178,Rotating Gamma System radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"One hundred and thirty-two patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) were treated using the Rotating Gamma System, a new radiosurgical system between November 1996 and May 2000. The average size of the AVMs was 23 mm in diameter (range 6 to 69 mm). The mean dose delivered to the AVM margin was 19.2 Gy (range 13 to 25 Gy), and that delivered to the center of the AVMs was 37.6 Gy (range 32.5 to 50 Gy). One hundred and six patients were followed up for an average of 18.4 months (range 5 to 44 months). Five patients (4.7%) experienced rebleeding which took place between 5 and 13 months after treatment, but none of them died from hemorrhage. No bleeding took place after complete angiographic obliteration. Neuroimaging studies showed radiation-induced edema in 19 (22%) of the 87 patients, none of whom had severe permanent neurological deficits. Of the 68 patients followed up for more than one year, 57 underwent angiography at 1 year after treatment. The complete obliteration was demonstrated in 24 patients (42%) at 1 year. Of the 27 patients followed for more than 2 years, 23 patients underwent angiography 2 years after treatment, and complete obliteration was demonstrated in 18 patients (78%).

12007271,Is distortion correction necessary for digital subtraction angiography in the Gamma Knife treatment of intra-cranial arteriovenous malformations?,"OBJECTIVE: The published literature maintains that distortion correction of digital subtraction angiography is essential for accurate definition of the arteriovenous malformation (AVM) nidus when performing Gamma Knife radiosurgery. However, as Gamma Knife treatments usually involve small volume targets, which are purposely positioned as close to the centre of the frame as possible, we postulated that the angiographic target images should be minimally distorted. Thus, the use of uncorrected images would not significantly compromise the accuracy of the treatment. We investigated this postulate. DESIGN: Patient and phantom images with and without distortion correction were assessed. The errors measured in the angiograms were compared to those of MR and CT images of the same subjects. Any errors less than 0.5 mm in any modality were accepted as intrinsic. RESULTS: All errors measured in the study were sub-millimetre. In the patient group, errors with distortion correction averaged 0.13 mm (range 0-0.3 mm). Without distortion correction, errors averaged 0.34 mm (range 0.1-0.6 mm). By comparison, the average error for intracranial MR imaging was 0.3 mm, with a maximum of 0.6 mm. CONCLUSION: For small, intracranial AVMs distortion correction did not significantly reduce the errors associated with the definition of the stereotactic co-ordinates. We suggest that prior to the purchase of this software, similar in-house testing should be performed.",2001,2001,Stereotactic and functional neurosurgery,76,2,94-105,eng,False,56498;10.1159/000056498,Comparative Study;Journal Article,"Angiography, Digital Subtraction/*methods/statistics & numerical data;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Radiosurgery/*methods/statistics & numerical data",

11404702,[Technique of Linac radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations].,BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Description of the irradiation technique used by our group since 1986 for radiosurgery of cerebral arteriovenous malformations using Xrays minibeams from a linear accelerator. Method. The technique was elaborated by O. Betti in the early 80. He used several coronal arcs to irradiate the center of the target with X rays circular minibeams. Their diameter (6 to 20 mm) is chosen according to the size of the nidus. The patient is seated in a specially built armchair. His head is immobilized with the Talairach frame afixed in the calvarium by 4 special screws: they allow to remove the frame after stereotactic angiography and/or CTscan and to replace it to perform the stereotactic irradiation. The frame and the head rotate around an horizontal axis passing by the linac isocenter ie the center of the target volume. The combination of both movements: rotation of the Linac and rotation of the stereotactic frame covers a spherical sector representing the surface of portals of entry of the minibeams. The frame can slide on a plate allowing access to the entire brain. Results. The special seat and the frame are movable on curved rails allowing to avoid or reduce irradiation of the body of the patient. CONCLUSION: We have been using this system of irradiation in the seated position since 1986 to treat more than 900 patients.,2001 May,2001,Neuro-Chirurgie,47,2-3 Pt 2,246-52,fre,False,75791,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Dose Fractionation, Radiation;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;*Particle Accelerators;Posture;Radiosurgery/instrumentation/*methods;Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted/methods;Stereotaxic Techniques/instrumentation",
11404701,[Radiosurgery of cerebral arteriovenous malformations: methodology of the dose prescription and its implications for dosimetric results. Retrospective study of 408 cases].,"PURPOSE: To study dosimetric implications of our group dose prescription methodology on a series of 408 cerebral arteriovenous malformations. MATERIAL: and method. Between January 1990 and July 1998, 408 patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations that had never been irradiated before, were treated radiosurgically in a single fraction at Tenon Hospital. 223 patients were treated with a single isocentre and 185 with multiple isocenters. Dosimetric characteristics have been studied as a function of the global quality index of planning, defined our group as the standard deviation of the differential dose volume histogram calculated in the lesion. RESULTS: One percent correlation obtained between some dosimetric data and the global quality index of planning allowed to modelize by linear equations the connection between this quality index and minimum isodose in the lesion, mean doses and isodoses in the underdosed part of the lesion and in the complete lesion. This was done for mono isocentric cases and multi isocentric cases. CONCLUSION: Before the choice of the therapeutic dose and prescription isodose, it is therefore possible from the global quality index of planning to foresee isodoses modelized by the defined equations. So, the radiotherapist can compensate using the prescription since conformity is not perfect and thus attenuate healthy tissues overdosage.",2001 May,2001,Neuro-Chirurgie,47,2-3 Pt 2,239-45,fre,False,75793,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Cohort Studies;Dose Fractionation, Radiation;Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/pathology/*surgery;Models, Theoretical;Paris/epidemiology;Radiation Injuries/etiology/prevention & control;Radiography;Radiosurgery/adverse effects/instrumentation/*methods;Radiotherapy Dosage;Retrospective Studies;Stereotaxic Techniques;Treatment Outcome",
14575848,Comparison of an image registration technique based on normalized mutual information with a standard method utilizing implanted markers in the staged radiosurgical treatment of large arteriovenous malformations.,"PURPOSE: To compare a noninvasive technique based on normalized mutual information for registering image sets associated with staged radiosurgical treatments of large arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), with a gold-standard method using radiographically evident markers implanted in the skull. METHODS: Nine patients receiving multistage treatment of large AVMs at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) gamma knife facility were included in this study. For each patient, the transformations of shot coordinates between a reference treatment stage and subsequent treatment stages were determined at UCSF, based on radiographically defined coordinates of implanted markers in each stereotactic space. A magnetic resonance (MR) image set was acquired for each treatment stage, and used for treatment planning. The two MR image sets for each treatment pair were sent to Yale for an unbiased, independent analysis of shot transformations. An image registration technique based on normalized mutual information was used to produce a single fused image study for each treatment pair. External copper sulfate fiducial markers for both image sets were evident on the fused images, allowing coordinates in both stereotactic systems to be defined. Coordinate transformation between the two systems was determined, based on digitized coordinates of seven common fiducial marker images. RESULTS: The average measured overall root-mean-square discrepancy between the Yale and UCSF transformed shot coordinates is 1.1 +/- 0.3 mm. The corresponding error in Yale transformed coordinates is 1.0 +/- 0.3 mm, assuming an inherent 0.5 mm error in the UCSF method. CONCLUSIONS: The normalized mutual information method can be used to obtain good image registration between successive sessions in staged treatments. Further improvements in the reported methodology are outlined.

METHODS: Positioning of the patient in the lateral decubitus position during LGK treatment switches the x and y axis coordinates. This increases the range of the x axis from 52 to 148 mm to 40 to 160 mm (i.e., 12 mm in each direction). RESULTS: Conversion of the coordinates of the isocenters is easily performed with simple mathematical algorithms and does not impair the precision of target positioning at the isocenters during LGK radiosurgery. CONCLUSION: LGK treatment in the lateral decubitus position is a simple accurate procedure for the treatment of far-lateral lesions that cannot be reached with normal supine positioning.",2002 Dec,2002,Neurosurgery,51,6,1512-7; discussion 1518-9,eng,False,,"Case Reports;Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;*Posture;Radiosurgery/*instrumentation;Temporal Lobe/*blood supply,

24257221,Factors Determining the Clinical Complications of Radiosurgery for AVM.,"PURPOSE: To identify the predictors of symptomatic post-radiation T2 signal change in patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVM) treated with radiosurgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The charts of 211 consecutive patients with arteriovenous malformations treated with either gamma knife radisurgery or linear accelerator radiosurgery between 2000-2009 were retrospectively reviewed. 168 patients had a minimum of 12 months of clinical and radiologic follow-up following the procedure and complete dosage data. Pretreatment characteristics and dosimetric variables were analyzed to identify predictors of adverse radiation effects. RESULTS: 141 patients had no clinical symptomatic complications. 21 patients had global or focal neurological deficits attributed to symptomatic edema. Variables associated with development of symptomatic edema included a non-hemorrhagic symptomatic presentation compared to presentation with hemorrhage, p=0.001; OR (95%CI) = 6.26 (1.99, 19.69); the presence of venous rerouting compared to the lack of venous rerouting, p=0.031; OR (95% CI) = 3.25 (1.20, 8.80); radiosurgery with GKS compared to linear accelerator radiosurgery p = 0.012; OR (95% CI) = 4.58 (1.28, 16.32); and the presence of more than one draining vein compared to a single draining vein p = 0.032; OR (95% CI) = 2.82 (1.06, 7.50). CONCLUSIONS: We postulated that the higher maximal doses used with gamma knife radiosurgery may be responsible for the greater number of adverse radiation effects with this modality compared to linear accelerator radiosurgery. We found that AVMs with greater venous complexity and therefore instability resulted in more adverse treatment outcomes, suggesting that AVM angioarchitecture should be considered when making treatment decisions.

METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed 61 brainstem AVMs in their institution between 2011 and 2017. The rupture risk was represented by annualised haemorrhagic rate. Patients were divided into five groups: conservation, microsurgery, embolisation, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and embolisation+SRS. Neurofunctional outcomes were evaluated by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Subgroup analysis was conducted between different management modalities to compare the long-term outcomes in rupture or unruptured cohorts. RESULTS: All of 61 brainstem AVMs (12 unruptured and 49 ruptured) were followed up for an average of 4.5 years. The natural annualised rupture risk was 7.3%, and the natural annualised reruptured risk in the ruptured cohort was 8.9%. 13 cases were conservative managed and 48 cases underwent intervention (including 6 microsurgery, 12 embolisation, 21 SRS and 9 embolisation+SRS). In the selection of interventional indication, diffuse nidus were often suggested conservative management (p=0.004) and nidus involving the midbrain were more likely to be recommended for intervention (p=0.034). The risk of subsequent haemorrhage was significantly increased in partial occlusion compared with complete occlusion and conservative management (p<0.001, p=0.036, respectively). In the subgroup analysis, the follow-up mRS scores of different management modalities were similar whether in the rupture cohort (p=0.064) or the unruptured cohort (p=0.391), as well as the haemorrhage-free survival (p=0.145). In the adjusted Bonferroni correction analysis of the ruptured cohort, microsurgery and SRS could significantly improve the obliteration rate compared with conservation (p<0.001, p=0.001, respectively) and SRS may have positive effect on avoiding new-onset neurofunctional deficit compared with microsurgery and embolisation (p=0.003, p=0.003, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Intervention has similar neurofunctional outcomes as conservation in these brainstem AVM cohorts. If intervention is adopted, partial obliteration should be avoided because of the high subsequent rupture risk.

33645357,Planning of gamma knife radiosurgery (GKR) for brain arteriovenous malformations using triple magnetic resonance angiography (triple-MRA).,"PURPOSE: Intra-arterial Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) is the gold standard technique for radiosurgery target delineation in brain Arterio-Venous Malformations (AVMs). This study aims to evaluate whether a combination of three Magnetic Resonance Angiography sequences (triple-MRA) could be used for delineation of brain AVMs for Gamma Knife Radiosurgery (GKR). METHODS: Fifteen patients undergoing DSA for GKR targeting of brain AVMs also underwent triple-MRA: 4D Arterial Spin Labelling based angiography (ASL-MRA), Contrast-Enhanced Time-Resolved MRA (CE-MRA) and High Definition post-contrast Time-Of-Flight angiography (HD-TOF). The arterial phase of the AVM nidus was delineated on triple-MRA by an interventional neuroradiologist and a consultant neurosurgeon (triple-MRA volume). Triple-MRA volumes were compared to AVM targets delineated by the clinical team for delivery of GKR using the current planning paradigm, i.e., stereotactic DSA and volumetric MRI (DSA volume). Difference in size, degree of inclusion (DI) and concordance index (CcI) between DSA and triple-MRA volumes are reported. RESULTS: AVM target volumes delineated on triple-MRA were on average 9.8% smaller than DSA volumes (95%CI:5.6-13.9%; SD:7.14%; p = .003). DI of DSA volume in triple-MRA volume was on average 73.5% (95%CI:71.2-76; range: 65-80%). The mean percentage of triple-MRA volume not included on DSA volume was 18% (95%CI:14.7-21.3; range: 7-30%). CONCLUSION: The technical feasibility of using triple-MRA for visualisation and delineation of brain AVMs for GKR planning has been demonstrated. Tighter and more precise delineation of AVM target volumes could be achieved by using triple-MRA for radiosurgery targeting.

26943847,Stereotactic radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations: evaluation of long-term outcomes in a multicenter cohort.,"OBJECTIVE In this multicenter study, the authors reviewed the results following Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), determined predictors of outcome, and assessed predictive value of commonly used grading scales based upon this large cohort with long-term follow-up. METHODS Data from a cohort of 2236 patients undergoing GKRS for cerebral AVMs were compiled from the International Gamma Knife Research Foundation. Favorable outcome was defined as AVM obliteration and no posttreatment hemorrhage or permanent symptomatic radiation-induced complications. Patient and AVM characteristics were assessed to determine predictors of outcome, and commonly used grading scales were assessed. RESULTS The mean maximum AVM diameter was 2.3 cm, with a mean volume of 4.3 cm(3). A mean margin dose of 20.5 Gy was delivered. Mean follow-up was 7 years (range 1-20 years). Overall obliteration was 64.7%. Post-GRKS hemorrhage occurred in 165 patients (annual risk 1.1%). Radiation-induced imaging changes occurred in 29.2%; 9.7% were symptomatic, and 2.7% had permanent deficits. Favorable outcome was achieved in 60.3% of patients. Patients with prior nidal embolization (OR 2.1, p < 0.001), prior AVM hemorrhage (OR 1.3, p = 0.007), eloquent location (OR 1.3, p = 0.029), higher volume (OR 1.01, p < 0.001), lower margin dose (OR 0.9, p < 0.001), and more isocenters (OR 1.1, p = 0.011) were more likely to have unfavorable outcomes in multivariate analysis. The Spetzler-Martin grade and radiosurgery-based AVM score predicted outcome, but the Virginia Radiosurgery AVM Scale provided the best assessment.

25376574,Changing times and early debates.,"The machine was soon being called the Gamma Knife. Its spread led to increasing numbers of papers from different centers but particularly Pittsburgh. As mentioned in the preface, the introduction of new methods in medicine is seldom without problems. There were a number of squabbles about the treatment of various indications. It was suggested that for AVMs, the GKS was unnecessary. For meningiomas, there was marked skepticism within the milieu itself in the early days. Metastases were not treated in Stockholm because of Leksell's opposition to the treatment of malignant disease, and indeed, these tumors became generally popular indications rather later. There was a thought that pituitary adenomas could be better treated with GKS but it proved too unreliable, and for these tumors, GKS remains an ancillary treatment method.

35405319,Awake Microsurgical Resection for a Precentral Gyrus Arteriovenous Malformation-Three-Dimensional Video and Anatomic Landmarks.,"Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are complex, heterogeneous, and uncommon neurovascular disorders that frequently manifest in young adults. Parenchymal AVMs are thought to be congenital, but this has been recently questioned in the literature.(1)(,)(2) AVMs can change over time and cause focal neurological signs or neurocognitive deficits.(3) The clinical presentation of an AVM is variable and depends mainly on the occurrence of bleeding as well as its location, size, and ability to take flow from adjacent areas.(4) AVMs can be treated by a single modality or a combination of different modalities. According to the Expert Consensus on the Management of Brain Arteriovenous Malformations, neurosurgery may be the best option for Spetzler-Martin grade 2 AVMs.(5) However, the treatment of these lesions when located in eloquent areas, especially in the central lobe, is controversial. Awake craniotomy allows identification of eloquent gyrus and can potentially facilitate resection with functional preservation. An alternative is stereotactic radiosurgery, but a qualitative comparative analysis revealed higher obliteration rate with awake AVM excision compared with stereotactic radiosurgery.(6) Awake craniotomy was the earliest surgical procedure known, and it has become fashionable again. It was used in the past for surgical management of intractable epilepsy, but its indications are increasing, and it is a widely recognized technique for resection of mass lesions involving the eloquent cortex and for deep brain stimulation.(7) Its application for resection of vascular lesions, including AVMs, is still limited.

33826718,Hemorrhage Following Complete Arteriovenous Malformation Resection With No Detectable Recurrence: Insights From a 27-Year Registry.,"BACKGROUND: Although recurrence and de novo formation of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) have been reported following complete resection, the occurrence of hemorrhage in the same location of an AVM with no detectable lesion (lesion-negative hemorrhage) has not been described after microsurgery. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the incidence and properties of lesion-negative hemorrhage following complete microsurgical resection. METHODS: A prospectively maintained registry of AVM patients seen at our institution between 1990 and 2017 was used. Microsurgically treated patients were selected, and the incidence of a lesion-negative hemorrhage was calculated and described with a Kaplan-Meier curve. Baseline characteristics as well as functional outcome at last follow-up were compared between patients with and without a lesion-negative hemorrhage. RESULTS: From a total of 789 AVM patients, 619 (79%) were treated, and 210 out of 619 patients (34%) underwent microsurgery with or without preoperative embolization or radiosurgery. The microsurgically treated cohort was followed up for a mean of 6.1 ± 3.0 yr after surgery with 5 (2.4%) patients experiencing postresection lesion-negative hemorrhage (3.9 per 1000 person-years) at an average of 8.6 ± 9.0 yr following surgery. Follow-up angiograms after hemorrhage (up to 2 mo posthemorrhage) confirmed the absence of a recurrent or de novo AVM in all cases. All patients with a lesion-negative hemorrhage initially presented with rupture before resection (Fisher P = .066; log-rank P = .057). The occurrence of a lesion-negative hemorrhage was significantly associated with worse modified Rankin scale scores at last follow-up (P = .031). CONCLUSION: A lesion-negative hemorrhage can occur following complete microsurgical resection in up to 2.4% of patients.

38700839,"Characterization of Pediatric Infratentorial Arteriovenous Malformations: A Retrospective, Multicenter Cohort Study.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Infratentorial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) harbor different characteristics compared with supratentorial AVMs. This study aims to explore the unique characteristics of pediatric infratentorial AVMs and their response to single session stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). METHODS: The International Radiosurgery Research Foundation database of pediatric patients with AVM (age <18 years) who underwent SRS was retrospectively reviewed. Baseline demographics, AVM characteristics, outcomes, and complications post-SRS were compared between infratentorial and supratentorial pediatric AVMs. Unfavorable outcome was defined as the absence of AVM obliteration, post-SRS hemorrhage, or permanent radiation-induced changes at last follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 535 pediatric AVMs managed with SRS with a median follow-up of 67 months (IQR 29.0-130.6) were included, with 69 being infratentorial and 466 supratentorial. The infratentorial group had a higher proportion of deep location (58.4% vs 30.3%, P = <.001), deep venous drainage (79.8% vs 61.8%, P = .004), and prior embolization (26.1% vs 15.7%, P = .032). There was a higher proportion of hemorrhagic presentation in the infratentorial group (79.7% vs 71.3%, P = .146). There was no statistically significant difference in the odds of an unfavorable outcome (odds ratio [OR] = 1.36 [0.82-2.28]), AVM obliteration (OR = 0.85 [0.5-1.43]), post-SRS hemorrhage (OR = 0.83 [0.31-2.18]), or radiologic radiation-induced changes (OR = 1.08 [0.63-1.84]) between both cohorts. No statistically significant difference on the rates of outcomes of interest and complications were found in the adjusted model. CONCLUSION: Despite baseline differences between infratentorial and supratentorial pediatric AVMs, SRS outcomes, including AVM obliteration and post-SRS hemorrhage rates, were comparable amongst both groups.

21121781,Gamma Knife surgery for large cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECT: Treatment of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is problematic due to many factors, including lesion size, lesion location, unacceptable complications, and negative outcomes. To overcome the limitation imposed by a large nidus volume, neurosurgeons have used Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) in a variety of ways, including combined with other treatment modalities, as volume-staged radiosurgery, and as repeat radiosurgery. We performed repeat radiosurgeries in patients who harbored large AVMs (> 30 cm(3)) and analyzed the AVM obliteration rates and complications. METHODS: The authors reviewed the cases of 44 patients at a single institution who underwent GKS between 1992 and 2007 for treatment of an AVM whose nidus was 30 cm(3) or larger. The mean age of the patients was 27 years (range 4.5-62.3 years), and the median duration of follow-up was 109.4 months (range 27-202 months). The mean AVM nidus volume was 48.8 cm(3) (range 30.3-109.5 cm(3)), and the mean radiation dose delivered to the margin of the nidus was 13.9 Gy (range 8.4-17.5 Gy). The authors determined complete AVM nidus obliteration based on findings on both MR images and digital subtraction angiograms. When they did not detect complete obliteration after GKS, they performed 1 or more additional GKSs separated by a minimum interval of 3 years. RESULTS: The overall obliteration rate following repeat GKS was 34.1%, and the estimated obliteration rate at 120 months was 41.8%. Three patients (6.8%) experienced hemorrhages after GKS, and 2 patients (4.5%) developed cysts. One patient (2.3%) experienced a newly developed seizure following GKS, and another patient (2.3%) was found to have radiation necrosis. CONCLUSIONS: Even though complete obliteration of the large AVMs after repeat GKS took a long time, the complication rate was quite acceptable. In addition, the estimated obliteration rate at long-term follow-up was respectable. Repeat GKS should be considered as a primary treatment option for symptomatic large AVMs to overcome the limitation imposed on successful obliteration by the large volume of the nidus.",2010 Dec,2010,Journal of neurosurgery,113 Suppl,,2-8,eng,False,10.3171/2010.7.GKS101043;10.3171/2010.7.GKS101043,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adolescent;Adult;Brain/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Cerebral Angiography;Cerebral Hemorrhage/diagnostic imaging/etiology;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Necrosis/etiology;Radiosurgery/adverse effects/*instrumentation;Reoperation;Seizures/etiology;Treatment Outcome",
36411595,Susceptibility weighted imaging for qualitative grading of persistent arteriovenous shunting in deep-seated arteriovenous malformations after stereotactic radiation surgery.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To investigate Susceptibility Weighted Imaging (SWI) signal changes in the draining vein of deep-seated arterio-venous malformations (AVMs) following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). METHODS AND MATERIALS: This is a retrospective study of 32 patients with deep-seated AVMs who were treated with SRS. Pre-SRS treatment and post-SRS treatment MRI were performed at 6, 12, and 24-month intervals. Deep-seated AVMs were classified based on their anatomical location and venous drainage pattern. AVM nidal volume (cm(3)) was estimated using the ABC/2 method. AV shunting of the AVM draining veins were graded according to its SWI signal intensity: hyperintense (grade III), mixed signal intensity (grade II), hypointense (grade I) and absent (grade 0). Conventional time-of-flight (TOF)-MRA and contrast enhanced (CE)-MRA sequences were performed to document the patency of the vein. RESULTS: Pre-SRS treatment AVM draining veins were either grade III 18/32 (56%) or grade II 14/32 (44%). Using mixed effects analysis, we demonstrate that each month following the SRS treatment nidal volumes decreased at the rate of 0.51 cm(3)/per month (CI -0.61 to (-0.40)) p =.00. Following the treatment, there was a clinically significant relationship between the signal and nidal volume: signal 0 corresponded with average nidal volume of 1.81 cm(3) (CI 1.40-2.21), signal 1 with nidal volume of 2.06 cm(3) (CI 1.69-2.44), signal 2 with nidal volume 2.73 cm(3) (CI 2.35-3.11) and signal 3 with nidal volume 3.13 cm(3) (CI 2.70-3.56) p = .00.

37757652,CyberKnife based fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy as an upfront treatment for cerebral arteriovenous malformation.,"BACKGROUND: To explore the therapeutic outcomes of CyberKnife based fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (CKFRT) for patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM). METHODS: Between January 2008 and October 2020, 45 patients underwent CKFRT for cerebral AVMs as a first treatment. The delineation of AVM targets included AVM nidus. The mean target volume was 4.07 cm(3), and 9 lesions (20%) were larger than 10.0 cm(3). The mean marginal dose was 24 Gy (range, 20-35 Gy). CKFRT was delivered in median 3 fractions (range, 2 ∼ 5 fractions). AVM obliteration following CKFRT was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging or angiography. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 47 (5-148) months, complete obliteration and partial obliteration of AVM after CKFRT were obtained in 23 (51%) and 13 (29%) patients, respectively. Median time to complete obliteration was 39 (15-63) months. The cumulative probability of complete obliteration rate at 3 years was 47%. Complete obliteration rate of AVM was associated with Radiosurgery-based AVM score, which was consisted of AVM volume, patients age, and AVM location. One (2%) patient had hemorrhage during the follow-up period.

19946691,Multimodality treatment of cerebral AVMs in children: a single-centre 20 years experience.,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to review our experience with a multimodality treatment approach in the management of cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in children. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed a consecutive series of 56 children who harboured a cerebral AVM and were treated at our institution between 1988 and 2008. During the whole treatment period, a combined treatment strategy, including microsurgery, endovascular treatment and gamma knife radiosurgery, was used. RESULTS: Of the 56 patients (median age, 14.0; range, 3 months-18 years) reported, 36 (64.3%) were admitted after AVM rupture; of these, only one AVM (1.8%) was considered untreatable. In 30.9% (17/55) of the treated patients, a single treatment measure was sufficient to attain angiographic cure of the AVM. Among these, six patients (10.9%) had microsurgical AVM resection, four patients (7.3%) underwent endovascular treatment, and another seven patients (12.7%) underwent radiosurgical management of the AVM. The majority of the population (38/55; 69.1%) underwent combined treatment: 21 patients (38.2%) received embolisation followed by radiosurgery of the remnant nidus, ten patients (18.2%) underwent embolisation with subsequent surgical resection of the residual AVM, three patients (5.5%) had radiosurgery after incomplete surgical AVM nidus resection and another four patients (7.3%) required a combination of all three treatment modalities to achieve permanent angiographic cure of the AVM. We observed good clinical outcomes (Glasgow Outcome Scale 5 and 4) in 94.6% of the children. Complete angiographic obliteration was achieved in 93.3% of the patients treated. CONCLUSION: A multimodality treatment approach in children harbouring cerebral AVMs leads to excellent angiographic and clinical outcomes.",2010 May,2010,Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for,26,5,681-7,eng,False,10.1007/s00381-009-1039-8;10.1007/s00381-009-1039-8,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Child;Child, Preschool;Combined Modality Therapy;Embolization, Therapeutic;Female;Humans;Infant;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*therapy;Male;Neurosurgical Procedures;Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies",
27153173,Embolization of the choroidal artery in the treatment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVE The anterior and posterior choroidal arteries are often recruited to supply arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) involving important paraventricular structures, such as the basal ganglia, internal capsule, optic radiation, lateral geniculate body, and medial temporal lobe. Endovascular embolization through these arteries is theoretically dangerous because they supply eloquent territories, are of small caliber, and lack collaterals. This study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of embolization through these arteries. METHODS This study retrospectively reviewed 13 patients with cerebral AVMs who underwent endovascular embolization through the choroidal arteries between 2006 and 2014. Embolization was performed as a palliative procedure before open surgery or Gamma Knife radiosurgery. Computed tomography and MRI were performed the day after embolization to assess any surgical complications. The incidence and type of complications and their association with clinical outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS Decreased blood flow was achieved in all patients after embolization. Postoperative CT detected no hemorrhagic complications. In contrast, postoperative MRI detected that 4 of the 13 patients (30.7%) developed infarctions: 3 patients after embolization through the anterior choroidal artery, and 1 patient after embolization through the lateral posterior choroidal artery. Two of the 4 patients in whom embolization was from the cisternal segment of the anterior choroidal artery (proximal to the plexal point) developed symptomatic infarction of the posterior limb of the internal capsule, 1 of whom developed morbidity (7.7%). The treatment-related mortality rate was 0%. Additional treatment was performed in 12 patients: open surgery in 9 and Gamma Knife radiosurgery in 3 patients. Complete obliteration was confirmed by angiography at the last follow-up in 10 patients. Recurrent bleeding from the AVMs did not occur in any of the cases during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS Ischemic complications are possible following the embolization of cerebral AVMs through the choroidal artery, even with modern neurointerventional devices and techniques. Although further study is needed, embolization through the choroidal artery may be an appropriate treatment option when the risk of surgery or radiosurgery is considered to outweigh the risk of embolization.",2017 Apr,2017,Journal of neurosurgery,126,4,1114-1122,eng,False,10.3171/2016.2.JNS152370;10.3171/2016.2.JNS152370,Comment;Journal Article,"*Embolization, Therapeutic;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome",AChA = anterior choroidal artery;AVM = arteriovenous malformation;DWI = diffusion-weighted imaging;GK = Gamma Knife;ICA = internal carotid artery;LPChA = lateral posterior choroidal artery;NBCA = N-butyl cyanoacrylate;PChA = posterior choroidal artery;arteriovenous malformation;choroidal artery;complications;embolization;interventional neurosurgery;vascular disorders
38728853,Changes in inpatient brain arteriovenous malformation management in the United States following the ARUBA trial: analysis of an interrupted time series design.,"The November 2013 online publication of ARUBA, the first multi-institutional randomized controlled trial for unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), has sparked over 100 publications in protracted debates METHODS: This study sought to examine inpatient management patterns of brain AVMs from 2009 to 2016 and observe if changes in U.S. inpatient management were attributable to the ARUBA publication using interrupted time series of brain AVM studies from the National Inpatient Sample data 2009-2016. Outcomes of interest were use of embolization, surgery, combined embolization and microsurgery, radiotherapy, and observation during that admission. An interrupted time series design compared management trends before and after ARUBA. Segmented linear regression analysis tested for immediate and long-term impacts of ARUBA on management. RESULTS: Elective and asymptomatic patient admissions declined 2009-2016. In keeping with the ARUBA findings, observation for unruptured brain AVMs increased and microsurgery decreased. However, embolization, radiosurgery, and combined embolization and microsurgery also increased. For ruptured brain AVMs, treatment modality trends remained positive with even greater rates of observation, embolization, and combined embolization and microsurgery occurring after ARUBA (data on radiosurgery were scarce). None of the estimates for the change in trends were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The publication of ARUBA was associated with a decrease in microsurgery and increase in observation for unruptured brain AVMs in the US. However, inpatient radiotherapy, embolization, and combined embolization and surgery also increased, suggesting trends moved counter to ARUBA's conclusions. This analysis suggested that ARUBA had a small impact as clinicians rejected ARUBA's findings in managing unruptured brain AVMs.",2024 Jul,2024,Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,242,,108293,eng,False,S0303-8467(24)00180-X;10.1016/j.clineuro.2024.108293;S0303-8467(24)00180-X;10.1016/j.clineuro.2024.108293,Journal Article,"Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/therapy;United States;*Embolization, Therapeutic/methods;*Interrupted Time Series Analysis;Female;Inpatients;Microsurgery;Male;Radiosurgery/trends;Adult;Middle Aged;Neurosurgical Procedures;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",Brain arteriovenous malformation;Embolization;Microsurgery;Population-based;Treatment
32065836,Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Spetzler-Martin Grade I and II Arteriovenous Malformations: International Society of Stereotactic Radiosurgery (ISRS) Practice Guideline.,"BACKGROUND: No guidelines have been published regarding stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in the management of Spetzler-Martin grade I and II arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). OBJECTIVE: To establish SRS practice guidelines for grade I-II AVMs on the basis of a systematic literature review. METHODS: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)-compliant search of Medline, Embase, and Scopus, 1986-2018, for publications reporting post-SRS outcomes in ≥10 grade I-II AVMs with a follow-up of ≥24 mo. Primary endpoints were obliteration and hemorrhage; secondary outcomes included Spetzler-Martin parameters, dosimetric variables, and ""excellent"" outcomes (defined as total obliteration without new post-SRS deficit). RESULTS: Of 447 abstracts screened, 8 were included (n = 1, level 2 evidence; n = 7, level 4 evidence), representing 1102 AVMs, of which 836 (76%) were grade II. Obliteration was achieved in 884 (80%) at a median of 37 mo; 66 hemorrhages (6%) occurred during a median follow-up of 68 mo. Total obliteration without hemorrhage was achieved in 78%. Of 836 grade II AVMs, Spetzler-Martin parameters were reported in 680: 377 were eloquent brain and 178 had deep venous drainage, totaling 555/680 (82%) high-risk SRS-treated grade II AVMs. CONCLUSION: The literature regarding SRS for grade I-II AVM is low quality, limiting interpretation. Cautiously, we observed that SRS appears to be a safe, effective treatment for grade I-II AVM and may be considered a front-line treatment, particularly for lesions in deep or eloquent locations. Preceding publications may be influenced by selection bias, with favorable AVMs undergoing resection, whereas those at increased risk of complications and nonobliteration are disproportionately referred for SRS.",2020 Sep 1,2020,Neurosurgery,87,3,442-452,eng,False,10.1093/neuros/nyaa004;5739575;nyaa004;10.1093/neuros/nyaa004,Journal Article;Systematic Review,"Adolescent;Adult;Arteriovenous Fistula/*surgery;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/*methods;Societies, Medical",Arteriovenous malformation;Guidelines;Selection bias;Spetzler-Martin grade;Stereotactic radiosurgery
37948702,Long-term outcomes of deep pediatric arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVE: Multimodality treatment has been shown to be the optimal management strategy for pediatric arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Deep AVMs represent a subset of AVMs for which optimal management may be achieved with a combination of radiosurgery and highly selective embolization, in the absence of compelling features requiring operative intervention. The objective of this study was to identify predictors of good functional outcomes in pediatric patients with deep AVMs. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of the outcomes of 79 patients with deep AVMs from January 1988 through December 2021 was performed. Deep AVMs were defined as those with the majority of the nidus centered in the basal ganglia, thalamus, or brainstem. Collected data included patient demographics and presenting symptoms, presenting modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score, radiographic findings and outcomes, management strategy, complications, and clinical outcomes as indicated by follow-up mRS score. A good outcome was defined as a follow-up mRS score ≤ 2, while a poor outcome was defined as a follow-up mRS score ≥ 3. Statistical analysis was performed to identify factors associated with functional outcomes. RESULTS: With a mean follow-up duration of 85.6 months, there was a 72.2% angiographic obliteration rate, with 75.9% of patients having a good clinical outcome (mRS score ≤ 2). Presenting symptoms and radiographic characteristics were not significantly associated with long-term functional outcomes. There was a significantly higher rate of posttreatment hemorrhage in patients with a poor versus good outcome (11.8% vs 0%, p = 0.010). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, poor long-term functional outcome was only associated with poor presenting mRS score (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Satisfactory angiographic obliteration rates and good long-term functional outcomes can be achieved for deep AVMs, with stereotactic radiosurgery as the cornerstone of multimodality treatment.",2024 Jan 1,2024,Journal of neurosurgery.

35077887,Predictive Factors for Arteriovenous Malformation Obliteration After Stereotactic Radiosurgery: A Single-Center Study.,"BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is particularly useful for treatment of deep arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in eloquent territory with a high associated surgical risk. Prior studies have demonstrated high rates of AVM obliteration with SRS (60%-80%) in a latency period of 2-4 years for complete obliteration. Studies have identified several factors associated with successful obliteration of the AVM nidus; however, these present inconsistent and conflicting data. The aim of this single-center study was to examine factors associated with successful obliteration of AVMs treated with SRS. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of 210 consecutive patients undergoing SRS for brain AVMs between 2010 and 2019. The χ(2) test and logistic regression analysis were used to identify patient and AVM factors associated with successful obliteration. RESULTS: Younger age (P = 0.034) and prior embolization (P = 0.012) were associated with complete obliteration. The presence of coronary artery disease was associated with incomplete obliteration (P = 0.04). No AVM characteristics were statistically associated with complete obliteration, although superficial venous drainage (P = 0.08) and frontal location (P = 0.06) trended toward significance. CONCLUSIONS: Successful obliteration of the AVM nidus was significantly associated with younger age and prior embolization. The presence of coronary artery disease negatively affected obliteration rates. These results add to the mixed results seen in the literature and emphasize the need for continued studies to delineate more specific patient and AVM factors that contribute to successful obliteration.",2022 Apr,2022,World neurosurgery,160,,e529-e536,eng,True,S1878-8750(22)00073-0;10.1016/j.wneu.2022.01.060;S1878-8750(22)00073-0;10.1016/j.wneu.2022.01.060,Journal Article,"*Embolization, Therapeutic/methods;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/radiotherapy/surgery;*Radiosurgery/methods;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome",AVM;Obliteration;Stereotactic radiosurgery
35643401,"Stereotactic Radio Surgery, Embolization and Conservative Management for Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformation: A New Zealand Experience of Long-Term Outcomes.","OBJECTIVE: Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) can be treated by microsurgery, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) as a stand-alone procedure, or combining embolization and conservative management. This single-center, retrospective review explored the outcomes of patients treated with SRS alone, embolization before SRS (ESRS), or conservative management for cerebral AVMs. METHODS: Demographic details, Spetzler-Martin grade, SRS dose, obliteration, time to obliteration, imaging modality, rebleed, disease-specific mortality, and post-SRS complications were collected. Chi-square tests of independence and 1-way analysis of variance/Kruskal-Wallis tests were performed. RESULTS: Two-hundred and thirty-nine patients were treated with SRS alone, 37 were treated with ESRS, and 83 were conservatively managed. Obliteration rates were 78% (SRS alone) and 70% (ESRS). Rebleed rates were comparable among SRS alone (4%), ESRS (0%), and conservative management (8%). Disease-specific mortality rates were significantly lower for SRS alone (1%) and ESRS (0%) compared with conservative management (6%, X(2) [2, n = 358] = 7.50, P = 0.024). Post-SRS complications occurred with SRS alone only and included radiation necrosis (n = 5), cavernous malformations (n = 2), and stroke (n = 1). Obliteration, rebleed, and disease-specific mortality rates were comparable among pediatric (<18 years), nonelderly (18-59 years), and elderly (≥60 years) age groups. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that SRS and ESRS are safe and effective treatments for cerebral AVM (when quantified by obliteration, rebleed, and disease-specific mortality rates). With multinational, prospective, randomized controlled trials with long follow-up periods, the effectiveness and safety of SRS and ESRS compared with conservative management for AVM will be further clarified.",2022 Aug,2022,World neurosurgery,164,,e992-e1000,eng,True,S1878-8750(22)00728-8;10.1016/j.wneu.2022.05.088;S1878-8750(22)00728-8;10.1016/j.wneu.2022.05.088,Journal Article,Aged;Child;Conservative Treatment;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery;New Zealand;Prospective Studies;*Radiosurgery/methods;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome,Arteriovenous malformation;Embolization;Embolization and SRS;LINAC SRS;Stereotactic radiosurgery conservative management
27285542,Delayed hemorrhage from the tissue of an occluded arteriovenous malformation after stereotactic radiosurgery: report of 3 cases.,"Stereotactic radiosurgery is widely used to treat cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), with the goal of complete angiographic obliteration. A number of case series have challenged the assumption that absence of residual AVM on follow-up angiograms is consistent with elimination of the risk of hemorrhage. The authors describe 3 cases in which patients who had angiographic evidence of AVM occlusion presented with late hemorrhage in the area of their prior lesions. They compare the radiographic, angiographic, and histological features of these patients with those previously described in the literature. Delayed hemorrhage from the tissue of occluded AVMs has been reported as early as 4 and as late as 11 years after initial stereotactic radiosurgery. In all cases for which data are available, hemorrhage occurred in the area of persistent imaging findings despite negative findings on conventional angiography. The hemorrhagic lesions that were resected demonstrated a number of distinct histological findings. While rare, delayed hemorrhage from the tissue of occluded AVMs may occur from a number of distinct, angiographically occult postirradiation changes. The hemorrhages in the authors' 3 cases were symptomatic and localized. The correlation of histological and imaging findings in delayed hemorrhage from occluded AVMs is an area requiring further investigation.",2017 Jun,2017,Journal of neurosurgery,126,6,1899-1904,eng,False,10.3171/2016.4.JNS152320;10.3171/2016.4.JNS152320,Case Reports;Journal Article,Cerebral Hemorrhage/*etiology;Child;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*radiotherapy;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult,AVM = arteriovenous malformation;EVG = elastic Van Gieson;GKS = Gamma Knife surgery;SRS = stereotactic radiosurgery;angiography;arteriovenous malformation;hemorrhage;stereotactic radiosurgery;vascular disorders
39641868,Lesion filling index predicts brain arteriovenous malformation obliteration after Gamma knife radiosurgery: a hemodynamic analysis.,"Hemodynamics significantly influences the clinical outcomes of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVM). This study aimed to determine if the lesion filling index (LFI), obtained via quantitative digital subtraction angiography (QDSA), can predict complete complete obliteration after Gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS). We retrospectively reviewed AVM patients who underwent GKRS and DSA exams from 2011 to 2021. Clinical, angioarchitectural, and QDSA hemodynamic features were analyzed. The LFI, derived from QDSA, was evaluated as a predictor of complete complete obliteration post-SRS using Cox proportional hazards and Kaplan-Meier analyses. Among 118 AVMs with a mean follow-up of 5.76 ± 2.76 years, post-SRS complete obliteration was linked to reduced nidus volume (7.27 ± 12.3 vs. 19.2 ± 35.7 mm³, p = 0.049), smaller nidus diameter (26.0 ± 14.9 vs. 34.1 ± 19.8 mm, p = 0.015), and absence of feeding artery dilation (21.1% vs. 46.3%, p = 0.008). Higher Arterial Diagnostic Window (ADW) (972.27 ± 1615.53 vs. 515.29 ± 730.26, p = 0.036), higher LFI (905.31 ± 2288.37 vs. 249.65 ± 1092.46, p = 0.037), and lower Transnidal Relative Velocity (TRV), a parameter defined as the maximum diameter of AVM divided by the full width at half maximum (74.31 ± 95.67 vs. 137.80 ± 152.01, p = 0.021), were also associated with complete obliteration. After adjusting for confounders, only two variables-absence of feeding artery dilation (HR 0.35, 95%CI 0.16-0.78, p = 0.010) and higher LFI (HR 1.00, 95%CI 1.00-1.00, p = 0.006) remained significant predictors. The ROC curve identified 188.4 as the LFI cutoff, and Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed LFI's predictive value (log-rank test, χ² = 12.776, p < 0.001). Elevated LFI and absence of feeding artery dilation predict AVM complete obliteration after GKRS, indicating that overfilling and low blood flow in the nidus may promote complete obliteration.",2024 Dec 6,2024,Neurosurgical review,47,1,889,eng,False,10.1007/s10143-024-03135-z;10.1007/s10143-024-03135-z;10.1007/s10143-024-03135-z,Journal Article,"Humans;*Radiosurgery/methods;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery;Male;Female;Adult;Middle Aged;*Hemodynamics/physiology;Retrospective Studies;*Angiography, Digital Subtraction;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult;Adolescent;Cerebral Angiography",Brain arteriovenous malformation;Gamma knife radiosurgery;Hemodynamics;Quantitative digital subtraction angiography
36585868,Long-term outcome of a tailored embolization strategy with Gamma Knife radiosurgery for high-grade brain arteriovenous malformations: a single-center experience.,"OBJECTIVE: The safety and efficacy of embolization with Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for high-grade brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) are uncertain. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the long-term outcome of a tailored embolization strategy with GKRS and identify the independent factors associated with bAVM obliteration. METHODS: Between January 2014 and January 2017, a consecutive cohort of 159 patients with high-grade bAVMs who underwent embolization with GKRS was enrolled in this prospective single-center cohort study. All patients received a tailored embolization strategy with GKRS. The primary outcome was defined as bAVM obliteration. Secondary outcomes were neurological function and complications. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 40.4 months, 5 patients were lost to follow-up. One hundred eighteen of the remaining 154 patients had favorable neurological outcomes with complete bAVM obliteration. A decrease in bAVM nidus size was observed in 36 patients. Five patients developed intracranial hemorrhage during the latency period, and 2 patients died. The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the obliteration rate increased each year and reached the peak point at approximately 3 years. The multivariate Cox regression analysis of factors affecting bAVM obliteration revealed that postembolization bAVM volume < 10 cm3 (p = 0.02), supratentorial location (p < 0.01), staged embolization prior to GKRS (p < 0.01), and mean Spetzler-Martin (SM) grade (p < 0.01) were independent factors associated with a high obliteration rate. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggested that high-grade bAVMs treated using a tailored embolization strategy with GKRS were associated with a favorable clinical outcome and obliteration rate. Postembolization bAVM volume < 10 cm3, supratentorial location, staged embolization prior to GKRS, and low mean SM grade were associated with a high obliteration rate.",2023 Jul 1,2023,Journal of neurosurgery,139,1,176-183,eng,True,10.3171/2022.11.JNS221363;10.3171/2022.11.JNS221363,Journal Article,Humans;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects;Treatment Outcome;Cohort Studies;Prospective Studies;Retrospective Studies;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications;Brain;Follow-Up Studies,Gamma Knife;arteriovenous malformation;embolization;obliteration;stereotactic radiosurgery;vascular disorders
22910397,Vascular complications of stereotactic radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVE: Although vasculopathy and de novo aneurysm formation are known complications of traditional radiation therapy, their occurrence following AVM SRS is rare and thus infrequently addressed in the literature. We sought to evaluate these phenomena through a review of our institutional experience. METHODS: Our review afforded 32 patients treated with LINAC-based SRS over an eight year period. We noted obliteration rates, complication rates and long-term outcomes, with particular attention paid to follow-up angiographic studies. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 4.3 years, the overall obliteration rate was 50%, increasing to 87% for AVMs less than 3cm. Eight patients had nine hemorrhages following SRS (25%). One occurred in the context of a de novo arterial pseudoaneurysm and another in the context of a new venous varix. Two patients with post-SRS hemorrhage had intranidal aneurysms that were not as apparent on initial angiography. Two patients that did not suffer from latency period hemorrhage developed dysplastic changes of feeding arteries, and one patient suffered from early venous thrombosis with resultant permanent hemiparesis from infarction. After a mean follow-up of 4.3 years, 8 patients were clinically improved (25%), 19 were the same (59%), and 5 were worse (16%), including 2 that died as a result of latency period hemorrhage. CONCLUSION: While radiosurgery of AVMs is safe and successful in the vast majority of cases, vasculopathic complications including de novo aneurysm and varix development, early venous occlusion and stenotic vasculopathy, while infrequent, can occur.

10874151,Acute complications following gamma knife radiosurgery are rare.,"BACKGROUND: Gamma knife radiosurgery (GKR) is a safe and effective alternative to surgery for intracranial lesions. Most studies evaluating toxicity after GKR have concentrated on the delayed radiation effects. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 835 consecutive GKR cases for early (within 7 days) neurological complications or death. RESULTS: We identified a total of 18 patients (2.2%) who had a neurological event or death. Five (0.6%) patients developed new focal deficits, 12 (1.4%) patients experienced a seizure and there were three (0.4%) deaths. Two deaths were related to development of seizures and neurological deterioration. One death was caused by a respiratory arrest related to the patient's primary cancer. Of the five patients with neurological deficits, none had a persistent deficit. In two cases the neurological deficits were due to an increase in edema. Whether this occurred as a result of the gamma knife treatment or was the natural progression of the tumor is unclear. CONCLUSIONS: Complications after GKR are uncommon and the risk of a permanent deficit arising from an acute neurological event is exceedingly low.",2000 May,2000,Surgical neurology,53,5,498-502; discussion 502,eng,False,S0090-3019(00)00219-6;10.1016/s0090-3019(00)00219-6,Journal Article,Acute Disease;Adult;Aged;Brain Neoplasms/surgery;Female;Gamma Rays;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Radiation Injuries/*etiology;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects/mortality;Retrospective Studies,
28217873,Radiosurgery for Arteriovenous Malformations and the Impact on Headaches.,"BACKGROUND: Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) can underlie many diverse neurological signs and symptoms. Headaches are a common presentation that can have a significant impact on quality of life. OBJECTIVE: The authors investigated Gamma Knife(®) stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) outcomes in patients with AVMs and associated headaches. METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed 102 patients with AVMs who underwent SRS between 1995 and 2013. The patient's headache symptoms led to their AVM diagnosis or developed post hemorrhage of their AVM. Information regarding headache characteristics was obtained from the patient's medical records and at follow-up using a scripted clinical interview. The median imaging follow-up was 61.7 months and clinical follow-up was 89.7 months. The median treatment volume at SRS was 4.1 cm(3) and the median marginal dose was 20 Gy. RESULTS: The actuarial AVM obliteration rate was 60% at 5 years and 78% at 10 years. Patients reported that their overall headache severity decreased by -43.6% and their headache frequency was reduced by -53.4%. Headache reduction was reported in 49.1% of patients at 1 year and 69.5% at 5 years. The median time until improvement was 6.5 months. After SRS, headache medication usage decreased in 29% of patients. Permanent adverse radiation effects after SRS occurred in 3% of patients. Until obliteration was complete, the annual risk of a hemorrhage after SRS was 0.4% per year. CONCLUSION: Although recall bias related to a retrospective analysis can impact outcomes, headache symptoms associated with AVMs may potentially be decreased or eliminated in a subset of patients treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery.",2017 May,2017,Headache,57,5,737-745,eng,True,10.1111/head.13055;10.1111/head.13055,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Arteriovenous Fistula/complications/diagnostic imaging/*therapy;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/diagnostic;Male;Middle Aged;Outcome Assessment, Health Care/*statistics & numerical data;Radiosurgery/adverse effects/*methods;Vascular Headaches/diagnostic imaging/etiology/*therapy;Young Adult",arteriovenous malformation;gamma knife;headache;migraine;stereotactic radiosurgery
26695091,Long-term Outcomes of Patients With Giant Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations.,"BACKGROUND: Giant intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are rare cerebrovascular lesions that pose management challenges. OBJECTIVE: To further clarify outcomes in patients with giant cerebral AVMs managed with conservative or interventional therapies. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all patients diagnosed with AVMs evaluated at our institution from 1990 to 2013. Patients with a single intracranial AVM >6 cm were included. Patients were divided into 2 groups: conservative management or intervention (microsurgery, radiosurgery, or embolization). Functional outcome was assessed with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS: A total of 55 patients with giant AVMs were included, and 35 patients (63.6%) had clinical follow-up with a mean of 11.8 years. Spetzler-Martin grades were as follows: grade III, n = 2 (3.6%); grade IV, n = 15 (27.3%); and grade V, n = 38 (69.1%). Twenty-four patients (43.6%) were conservatively managed. The patients in the conservatively managed group had larger AVMs (P < .05) with more frequent involvement of the temporal lobe (P = .02). Five patients (26.3%) in the conservatively managed group and 5 (31.3%) in the intervention group experienced hemorrhage during follow-up, translating to an annualized risk of 2.7% and 4.1%, respectively. No significant difference in risk of first subsequent hemorrhage was observed (P = .78). Despite comparable mRS scores at presentation, we observed a trend toward better outcomes (mRS < 2) in patients undergoing conservative management (P = .06) compared with the intervention group at last follow-up. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that interventions for giant AVMs should be considered cautiously because hemorrhagic risk is similar regardless of management strategy and functional outcome is likely to be same or better in the conservatively managed population.

Embolization is a critical component in the management of many patients with cerebral AVMs. Embolization may be used as an independent curative therapy or more commonly in an adjuvant fashion prior to either micro- or radiosurgery.

METHODS: Factors associated with the obliteration rate and neurologic complications were studied retrospectively in pediatric patients who underwent LINAC-based SRS for AVM between June 1995 and May 2014. RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 36 males and 33 females, with a median age at the time of SRS of 14 years (range, 7-18 years). The mean AVM volume was 8.5 ± 8.7 cc (range, 0.6-41.8 cc). The median marginal dose of radiation delivered was 15 Gy (range, 9-20 Gy). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated complete obliteration of the AVM in 44 of the 69 patients (63.8%), at a mean follow up of 27.5 months (range, 12-90 months). On subgroup analysis, 41 of the 53 AVMs of ≤14 cc in volume (77.3%) were obliterated. AVMs with a modified AVM radiosurgery score <1 had significantly shorter obliteration times from the time of SRS (P = .006). On multivariate analysis, the mean marginal dose of radiation delivered to the AVM was the sole significant predictor of obliteration (odds ratio, 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 1 to 2.4). CONCLUSIONS: A modest median marginal dose of 15 Gy (16 Gy in the obliterated AVM group vs. 12 Gy in the nonobliterated group) resulted in an obliteration rate of 66.7% after LINAC-based SRS for intracranial AVM, with low rate.",2016 Nov,2016,World neurosurgery,95,,425-433,eng,False,S1878-8750(16)30392-8;10.1016/j.wneu.2016.06.007;S1878-8750(16)30392-8;10.1016/j.wneu.2016.06.007,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Angiography, Digital Subtraction;Cerebral Angiography;Child;Cohort Studies;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/*radiotherapy;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Particle Accelerators;Radiosurgery/*methods;*Radiotherapy Dosage;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome",Arteriovenous malformation;Intracranial;Linear accelerator;Stereotactic radiosurgery
21990534,Supernova hemorrhage: obliterative hemorrhage of brain arteriovenous malformations following γ knife radiosurgery.,"Hemorrhage represents the most feared complication of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in both untreated patients and those treated with gamma knife radiosurgery. Radiosurgery does not immediately lead to obliteration of the malformation, which often does not occur until years following treatment. Post-obliteration hemorrhage is rare, occurring months to years after radiosurgery, and has been associated with residual or recurrent AVM despite prior apparent nidus elimination. Three cases are reported of delayed intracranial hemorrhage in patients with cerebral AVMs treated with radiosurgery in which no residual AVM was found on catheter angiography at the time of delayed post-treatment hemorrhage. That the pathophysiology of these hemorrhages involves progressive venous outflow occlusion is speculated and the possible mechanistic link to subsequent vascular rupture is discussed.",2012 Sep,2012,Journal of neurointerventional surgery,4,5,364-7,eng,False,10.1136/neurintsurg-2011-010098;neurintsurg-2011-010098;10.1136/neurintsurg-2011-010098,Case Reports;Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Cerebral Hemorrhage/*diagnosis/*etiology;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects;Treatment Outcome,
11504101,Management of cysts arising after radiosurgery to treat intracranial arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVE: The proper treatment for patients with cyst formation after arteriovenous malformation radiosurgery is unknown. METHODS: The treatment of six patients who developed cysts after arteriovenous malformation radiosurgery is described. Four patients had undergone gamma knife radiosurgery (two patients developed cysts after repeat procedures), and two patients had undergone linear accelerator-based radiosurgery. The median prescription isodose volume at the time of the first radiosurgical procedure was 13.2 cm3 (range, 8.0-28.7 cm3). RESULTS: The cysts were discovered a median of 48 months (range, 24-89 mo) after radiosurgery. Three patients were originally without symptoms, and observation with serial imaging was performed; two of those patients developed symptoms 13 and 40 months later, whereas one patient has remained without symptoms for 51 months. Initial treatments for patients with symptomatic cysts included cyst aspiration (n = 3) and placement of a cystoperitoneal shunt (CPS) (n = 2). The median cyst volume was 14 cm3 (range, 4-63 cm3). Cyst recurrence occurred within 2 months for patients who underwent aspiration alone, necessitating placement of a CPS. Shunt placement eliminated the cysts for four patients, at a median follow-up time of 16 months (range, 9-27 mo). One patient's cyst persisted despite CPS placement, and cyst excision was performed. No morbidity occurred with any of the cyst treatments. CONCLUSION: Cyst formation after arteriovenous malformation radiosurgery may occur many years after the procedure. Although most symptomatic cysts can be effectively treated with CPSs, cyst excision may be necessary if the mass effect is not relieved with the less invasive approach.",2001 Aug,2001,Neurosurgery,49,2,259-64; discussion 264-5,eng,False,10.1097/00006123-200108000-00004,Journal Article,Adult;Brain Diseases/diagnosis/*etiology/*therapy;Cysts/diagnosis/*etiology/*therapy;Drainage;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects;Recurrence,

Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) can obliterate the nidus by delivering a precise high dose of ionising radiation in a single fraction. This paper updates long term AVM obliteration rates, time to obliteration and retreatment outcomes in LINAC delivered SRS treatment at the Royal Adelaide Hospital. A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained AVM SRS database supplemented by clinical case notes, patient correspondence and electronic medical records was performed. 89 AVMs received primary SRS treatment for which the crude obliteration rate was 61% (68% for 79 patients with adequate follow up). Higher marginal dose, smaller nidus size and lower Pollock-Flickinger (PF) score were significantly associated with AVM obliteration. The crude obliteration rates for patients with adequate follow-up and AVM diameter < 3 cm vs ≥ 3 cm were 76% vs 48%, respectively, and 93% with PF score < 1.0. Median time to obliteration was 36 months. Higher dose and lower PF score were associated with earlier obliteration. The crude obliteration rate after second SRS was 56% (9/16 patients) and no significant associations were found. These obliteration rates after primary and retreatment LINAC SRS are comparable to other studies. Marginal dose and PF score were the main predictors of obliteration overall as well as early (<36 months) obliteration.",2022 Aug,2022,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society,102,,54-59,eng,True,S0967-5868(22)00248-X;10.1016/j.jocn.2022.06.003;S0967-5868(22)00248-X;10.1016/j.jocn.2022.06.003,Journal Article,Brain;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/radiotherapy/surgery;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome,Arteriovenous malformation;Linear accelerator;Obliteration;Retreatment;Stereotactic radiosurgery
34087891,The predictors of clinical outcomes in brainstem arteriovenous malformations after stereotactic radiosurgery.,"The brainstem arteriovenous malformations (BS-AVMs) have a high morbidity and mortality and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has been widely used to treat BS-AVMs. However, no consensus is reached in the explicit predictors of obliteration for BS-AVMs after SRS.To identify the predictors of clinical outcomes for BS-AVMs treated by SRS, we performed a retrospective observational study of BS-AVMs patients treated by SRS at our institution from 2006 to 2016. The primary outcomes were obliteration of nidus and favorable outcomes (AVM nidus obliteration with mRS score ≤2). For getting the outcomes more accurate, we also pooled the results of previous studies as well as our study by meta-analysis.A total of 26 patients diagnosed with BS-AVMs, with mean volume of 2.6 ml, were treated with SRS. Hemorrhage presentation accounted for 69% of these patients. Overall obliteration rate was 42% with mean follow-up of more than five years and two patients (8%) had a post-SRS hemorrhage. Favorable outcomes were observed in 8 patients (31%). Higher margin dose (>15Gy) was associated with higher obliteration (P = .042) and small volume of nidus was associated with favorable outcomes (P = .036). After pooling the results of 7 studies and present study, non-prior embolization (P = .049) and higher margin dose (P = .04) were associated with higher obliteration rate, in addition, the lower Virginia Radiosurgery AVM Scale (VRAS) was associated with favorable outcomes (P = .02) of BS-AVMs after SRS.In the BS-AVMs patients treated by SRS, higher margin dose (19-24Gy) and non-prior embolization were the independent predictors of higher obliteration rate. In addition, smaller volume of nidus and lower VRAS were the potential predictors of long-term favorable outcomes for these patients.",2021 Jun 4,2021,Medicine,100,22,e26203,eng,False,10.1097/MD.0000000000026203;e26203;00005792-202106040-00074;MD-D-20-10350;10.1097/MD.0000000000026203,Journal Article;Observational Study,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Brain Stem/*blood supply/pathology;Clinical Decision Rules;Embolization, Therapeutic/statistics & numerical data;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnosis/mortality/*radiotherapy;Intracranial Hemorrhages/epidemiology;Male;Meta-Analysis as Topic;Middle Aged;Prognosis;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects/methods;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",
28885118,Stereotactic radiosurgery for Spetzler-Martin Grade IV and V arteriovenous malformations: an international multicenter study.,"OBJECTIVE Due to the complexity of Spetzler-Martin (SM) Grade IV-V arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), the management of these lesions remains controversial. The aims of this multicenter, retrospective cohort study were to evaluate the outcomes after single-session stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for SM Grade IV-V AVMs and determine predictive factors. METHODS The authors retrospectively pooled data from 233 patients (mean age 33 years) with SM Grade IV (94.4%) or V AVMs (5.6%) treated with single-session SRS at 8 participating centers in the International Gamma Knife Research Foundation. Pre-SRS embolization was performed in 71 AVMs (30.5%). The mean nidus volume, SRS margin dose, and follow-up duration were 9.7 cm(3), 17.3 Gy, and 84.5 months, respectively. Statistical analyses were performed to identify factors associated with post-SRS outcomes. RESULTS At a mean follow-up interval of 84.5 months, favorable outcome was defined as AVM obliteration, no post-SRS hemorrhage, and no permanently symptomatic radiation-induced changes (RIC) and was achieved in 26.2% of patients. The actuarial obliteration rates at 3, 7, 10, and 12 years were 15%, 34%, 37%, and 42%, respectively. The annual post-SRS hemorrhage rate was 3.0%. Symptomatic and permanent RIC occurred in 10.7% and 4% of the patients, respectively. Only larger AVM diameter (p = 0.04) was found to be an independent predictor of unfavorable outcome in the multivariate logistic regression analysis. The rate of favorable outcome was significantly lower for unruptured SM Grade IV-V AVMs compared with ruptured ones (p = 0.042). Prior embolization was a negative independent predictor of AVM obliteration (p = 0.024) and radiologically evident RIC (p = 0.05) in the respective multivariate analyses. CONCLUSIONS In this multi-institutional study, single-session SRS had limited efficacy in the management of SM Grade IV-V AVMs. Favorable outcome was only achieved in a minority of unruptured SM Grade IV-V AVMs, which supports less frequent utilization of SRS for the management of these lesions. A volume-staged SRS approach for large AVMs represents an alternative approach for high-grade AVMs, but it requires further investigation.",2018 Aug,2018,Journal of neurosurgery,129,2,498-507,eng,True,2017.3.JNS162635;10.3171/2017.3.JNS162635;2017.3.JNS162635;10.3171/2017.3.JNS162635,Journal Article;Multicenter Study,Adult;Child;Cohort Studies;Female;Humans;Internationality;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/classification/*radiotherapy;Male;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Severity of Illness Index,AVM = arteriovenous malformation;Gamma Knife;IGKRF = International Gamma Knife Research Foundation;RBAS = radiosurgery-based AVM score;RIC = radiation-induced changes;SM = Spetzler-Martin;SRS = stereotactic radiosurgery;Spetzler-Martin Grade IV and V;VRAS = Virginia Radiosurgery AVM Scale;intracranial arteriovenous malformation;intracranial hemorrhages;stereotactic radiosurgery;stroke;vascular disorders;vascular malformations
33845293,Characteristics of pial brain arteriovenous malformations with transdural arterial supply.,"PURPOSE: Transdural blood supply (TDBS) to pial brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVM) is uncommon and believed to be related to vascular endothelial growth factor - induced angiogenesis. The aim of this study was to define the BAVM characteristics in relation to presence and volume of TDBS. METHODS: BAVMs managed at our institution between January 2006 and December 2016 who subsequently underwent complete digital subtraction angiography (DSA) were included. They were classified based on presence of TDBS as well as volume of TDBS. RESULTS: Of the 641 BAVM patients managed during the recruitment period, 387 (391 BAVMs) had complete pretreatment DSAs. Forty-three (11.0 %, 10 ruptured) BAVMs exhibited TDBS. With TDBS group had a significantly greater proportion of large nidus (> 3.1 cm) than the Without TDBS group (85.1 % vs 19.5 %, p < 0.01) and were more frequently temporal (32.6 % vs 14.7 %, p < 0.01) and occipital (25.6 % vs 13.5 %, p < 0.05) in location. In unruptured BAVMs, the presence of headaches was significantly more prevalent when the malformation harboured TDBS compared to not (57.6 vs 34.8 %, p < 0.05). The annual rupture rate among unruptured BAVMs treated by conservative management was 4.7 % in the With TDBS (n = 12) group and 0% (n = 21) in BAVMs with TDBS that underwent treatment including surgery, endovascular therapy, or radiosurgery. CONCLUSION: BAVMs with TDBS are more likely to be associated with a large nidus and located in the temporal and occipital lobes. Headache is more frequently associated with the presence of TDBS.

METHODS: Electronic databases-Ovid MEDLINE and PubMed-were searched for studies in which there was evidence of exclusion treatment of low-grade BAVMs treated either by endovascular, surgical, radiosurgical, or multimodality treatment. The primary outcome of interest was angiographic obliteration post-treatment and at follow-up. The secondary outcomes of interest were functional outcome (mRS), mortality rate, and hemorrhagic complication. Descriptive statistics were used to calculate rates and means. RESULTS: Eleven studies involving 1809 patients with low-grade BAVMs were included. Among these, 1790 patients treated by either endovascular, surgical, radiosurgical, or multimodality treatment were included in this analysis. Seventy-two percent of BAVMs were Spetzler-Martin grade II. The overall (i.e., including all exclusion treatment modalities) complete obliteration rate ranged from 36.5 to 100%. The overall symptomatic hemorrhagic complication rate ranged from 0 to 7.3%; procedure-related mortality ranged from 0 to 4.7%. CONCLUSION: Our systematic review of the literature reveals a high overall obliteration rate for low-grade BAVMs, either ruptured or unruptured, with low mortality rate and an acceptable post-treatment hemorrhagic complication rate.

30980204,What is the best therapeutic approach to a pediatric patient with a deep-seated brain AVM?,"Although brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) account for a very small proportion of cerebral pathologies in the pediatric population, they are the cause of roughly 50% of spontaneous intracranial hemorrhages. Pediatric bAVMs tend to rupture more frequently and seem to have higher recurrence rates than bAVMs in adults. Thus, the management of pediatric bAVMs is particularly challenging. In general, the treatment options are conservative treatment, microsurgery, endovascular therapy (EVT), gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS), proton-beam stereotactic radiosurgery (PSRS), or a combination of the above. In order to identify the best approach to deep-seated pediatric bAVMs, we performed a systematic review, according to the PRISMA guidelines. None of the options seem to offer a clear advantage over the others when used alone. Microsurgery provides the highest obliteration rate, but has higher incidence of neurological complications. EVT may play a role when used as adjuvant therapy, but as a stand-alone therapy, the efficacy is low and the long-term side effects of radiation from the multiple sessions required in deep-seated pediatric bAVMs are still unknown.

Finally, PSRS offers promising results with a more accurate radiation that avoids the surrounding tissue, but data is limited due to its recent introduction.

24093574,Stereotactic radiosurgery of intracranial arteriovenous malformations.,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) has been performed since the 1970s. When an AVM is treated with radiosurgery, radiation injury to the vascular endothelium induces the proliferation of smooth muscle cells and the elaboration of extracellular collagen, which leads to progressive stenosis and obliteration of the AVM nidus. Obliteration after AVM radiosurgery ranges from 60% to 80%, and relates to the size of the AVM and the prescribed radiation dose. The major drawback of radiosurgical AVM treatment is the risk of bleeding during the latent period (typically 2 years) between treatment and AVM thrombosis.",2013 Oct,2013,Neurosurgery clinics of North America,24,4,561-74,eng,False,S1042-3680(13)00033-8;10.1016/j.nec.2013.05.002;S1042-3680(13)00033-8;10.1016/j.nec.2013.05.002,Journal Article;Review,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Arteriovenous Fistula/*surgery;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Intracranial Hemorrhages/epidemiology/surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/adverse effects/*methods;Young Adult",Arteriovenous malformation;Gamma knife;Linear accelerator;Radiosurgery

30465384,Role Of Radiosurgery In Arteriovenous Malformations.,"BACKGROUND: Intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) consist of an abnormal nidus of blood vessels that shunt blood directly from an artery to a vein and thereby bypass an intervening capillary bed. AVMs may be found as an incidental finding. They may be associated with intracranial haemorrhage, seizures, headaches or neurological deficits. There are different treatment options for AVM. These include observation, microsurgery, Stereotactic radio surgery (SRS), endovascular embolization and intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). METHODS: Data was collected using searching engines like Pubmed, Google scholar, Embase, Cinahl and Medline. MeSH and Non-MeSH terms were used like Arterio-venous malformations, microsurgery, endovascular embolization. RESULTS: Multiple interventional radiosurgical techniques have been introduced in recent years. The most effective and least risk-associated methods are Stereotactic radiosurgery, Microsurgery, Embolization and Intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). However, the outcome of such treatment modalities depends upon Site of malformation, grade of AVM, patient's age/gender, dose and volume of radiosurgery. Digital substraction angiography (DSA) and MR angiography (MRA) are most suitable methods for the follow-up of AVMs. CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic radiosurgery is the most suitable technique for AVMs considering the good prognosis and the risks associated with this procedure. However, large AVMs require multidisciplinary approach for better results.",2018 Jul-Sep,2018,"Journal of Ayub Medical College, Abbottabad : JAMC",30,3,449-457,eng,False,3598/2003,Journal Article;Review,"Angiography, Digital Subtraction;*Embolization, Therapeutic;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/*therapy;Magnetic Resonance Angiography;Microsurgery;*Radiosurgery;*Vascular Surgical Procedures",Arterio-venous malformations;Endovascular embolization;Microsurgery;Stereotactic radio-surgery

36396047,The Era of Onyx Embolization: A Systematic and Literature Review of Preoperative Embolization Before Stereotactic Radiosurgery for the Management of Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformations.,"INTRODUCTION: The current treatment paradigm for intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) focuses on reducing the risk of intracranial hemorrhage using various therapeutic means including embolization, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), and microsurgical resection. To improve AVM obliteration rates with SRS, pre-radiosurgical embolization has been trialed in a number of studies to reduce the volume of the AVM nidus prior to radiosurgery. This study aimed to review the efficacy of pre-radiosurgical embolization in the pre-Onyx era compared to the current Onyx era. METHODS: A systematic review was performed using PubMed to identify studies with 20 or more AVM patients, embolization material, and obliteration rates for both embolization + stereotactic radiosurgery (E+SRS) and SRS-only groups. RESULTS: Seventeen articles consisting of 1133 eligible patients were included in this study. A total of 914 (80.7%) patients underwent embolization prior to SRS. Onyx was used as the embolysate in 340 (37.2%) patients in the E+SRS cohorts. Mean obliteration rate for the embolized cohort was 46.9% versus 46.5% in the SRS-only cohort. When comparing obliteration rates based on embolysate material, obliteration rate was 42.1% with Onyx+SRS and 50.0% in the non-Onyx embolysate + SRS cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Onyx (ethylene vinyl-alcohol copolymer dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and suspended in micronized tantalum powder) has been increasingly used for the embolization of intracranial AVMs with increased success regarding its ease of use from a technical standpoint and performs similarly to other embolysate materials.",2023 Feb,2023,World neurosurgery,170,,90-98,eng,False,S1878-8750(22)01610-2;10.1016/j.wneu.2022.11.058;S1878-8750(22)01610-2;10.1016/j.wneu.2022.11.058,Journal Article;Review;Systematic Review,"Humans;*Radiosurgery;Treatment Outcome;*Embolization, Therapeutic;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery;Combined Modality Therapy;Retrospective Studies;Follow-Up Studies",Cerebral arteriovenous malformation;Embolization;Onyx;Radiosurgery
35107672,Microsurgical Treatment of Deep and Eloquent AVMs.,"Over the past 30 years, the treatment of deep and eloquent arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) has moved away from microneurosurgical resection and towards medical management and the so-called minimally invasive techniques, such as endovascular embolization and radiosurgery. The Spetzler-Martin grading system (and subsequent modifications) has done much to aid in risk stratification for surgical intervention; however, the system does not predict the risk of hemorrhage nor risk from other interventions. In more recent years, the ARUBA trial has suggested that unruptured AVMs should be medically managed. In our experience, although these eloquent regions of the brain should be discussed with patients in assessing the risks and benefits of intervention, we believe each AVM should be assessed based on the characteristics of the patient and the angio-architecture of the AVM, in particular venous hypertension, which may guide us to treat even high-grade AVMs when we believe we can (and need to) to benefit the patient. Advances in imaging and intraoperative adjuncts have helped us in decision making, preoperative planning, and ensuring good outcomes for our patients. Here, we present several cases to illustrate our primary points that treating low-grade AVMs can be more difficult than treating high-grade ones, mismanagement of deep and eloquent AVMs at the behest of dogma can harm patients, and the treatment of any AVM should be tailored to the individual patient and that patient's lesion.",2022,2022,Advances and technical standards in neurosurgery,44,,17-53,eng,False,10.1007/978-3-030-87649-4_2;10.1007/978-3-030-87649-4_2,Journal Article,"*Embolization, Therapeutic;Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging;Microsurgery;*Radiosurgery;Treatment Outcome",ARUBA trial;AVM;Arteriovenous malformation;Deep AVM;Deep venous drainage;Eloquent brain;Microneurosurgery;Spetzler–Martin
11904049,Interactive use of cerebral angiography and magnetoencephalography in arteriovenous malformations: technical note.,"OBJECTIVE: To minimize the risks associated with treating cortical cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), we developed a technique combining functional imaging and cerebral angiography. The functional loci obtained by performing magnetoencephalography (MEG) are projected onto stereoscopic pairs of a stereotactically derived digital subtraction angiogram. The result is a simultaneous three-dimensional perspective of the angioarchitecture of an AVM and its relationship to the sensorimotor cortex. METHODS: Eight patients underwent multimodality brain imaging, including magnetic resonance imaging, functional mapping via MEG, and stereotactic angiography using a modified Compass fiducial system (Compass International, Rochester, MN). The coordinates derived by performing MEG were superimposed onto stereotactic, stereoscopic, angiographic pairs using custom-made distortion correction and coordinate transfer software. RESULTS: The magnetoencephalographic angiogram allowed simultaneous viewing of the angioarchitecture of the AVM nidus, the feeding vessels, and the draining veins and their relationship to the normal cerebral vasculature and functional cortex. This imaging technique was particularly valuable in identifying en passant vessels that supplied functional cortex and was used during the treatment of these lesions. CONCLUSION: The techniques of MEG and cerebral angiography were combined to provide simultaneous viewing of both modalities in a three-dimensional perspective. This technique can aid in risk stratification in the management of patients with cerebral AVMs. In addition, this technique can facilitate the selective targeting of vessels, thus potentially reducing the risks associated with embolization of these formidable lesions.",2002 Apr,2002,Neurosurgery,50,4,903-10; discussion 910-1,eng,False,10.1097/00006123-200204000-00047,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;*Cerebral Angiography;Embolization, Therapeutic;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnosis/therapy;*Magnetoencephalography;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery;Retreatment",
34509251,Comparison of management approaches in deep-seated intracranial arteriovenous malformations: Does treatment improve outcome?,"Deep-seated intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) represent a subset of AVMs characterized by variably reported outcomes regarding the risk of hemorrhage, microsurgical complications, and response to stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). We aimed to compare outcomes of microsurgery, SRS, endovascular therapy, and conservative follow-up in deep-seated AVMs. A prospectively maintained database of AVM patients (1990-2017) was queried to identify patients with ruptured and unruptured deep-seated AVMs (extension into thalamus, basal ganglia, or brainstem). Comparisons of hemorrhage-free survival and poor functional outcome (modified Rankin scale [mRS] > 2) were performed between conservative management, microsurgery (±pre-procedural embolization), SRS (±pre-procedural embolization), and embolization utilizing multivariable Cox and logistic regression analyses controlling for univariable factors with p < 0.05. Of 789 AVM patients, 102 had deep-seated AVMs (conservative: 34; microsurgery: 6; SRS: 54; embolization: 8). Mean follow-up time was 6.1 years and did not differ significantly between management groups (p = 0.393). Complete obliteration was achieved in 49% of SRS patients. Upon multivariable analysis controlling for baseline rupture with conservative management as a reference group, embolization was associated with an increased hazard of hemorrhage (HR = 6.2, 95%CI [1.1-40.0], p = 0.037), while microsurgery (p = 0.118) and SRS (p = 0.167) provided no significant protection from hemorrhage. Controlling for baseline mRS, microsurgery was associated with an increased risk of poor outcome (OR = 9.2[1.2-68.3], p = 0.030), while SRS (p = 0.557) and embolization (p = 0.541) did not differ significantly from conservative management.

23205802,"Risks of history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and other factors related to radiation-induced changes following Gamma Knife surgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations.","OBJECT: Diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension may be associated with complications following fractionated radiotherapy. To date no studies have determined the risk of radiation toxicity in patients with DM or hypertension who have undergone Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) for brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). The goal of the present study was to determine associations between DM or hypertension and other factors in the development of radiotoxicity, as measured by radiation-induced changes (RICs) on MR images following radiosurgery for AVM. METHODS: Using univariate methods and multivariate logistic regression, the authors compared the RIC status in patients 18 years of age and older with these patients' history of, or medication use for, DM or hypertension; tobacco use; patient age and sex; AVM volume; Spetzler-Martin AVM severity scale (Grades I and II vs Grades III-V); AVM surgery, AVM embolization, or hemorrhage prior to radiosurgery; AVM location; number of draining veins; and radiosurgery margin dose. RESULTS: Radiation-induced changes occurred in 38% of 539 adults within a mean (± standard deviation) of 12 ± 10 months after radiosurgery, as observed during a median follow-up time of 55 months. Among patients in whom RICs occurred, 34% had headaches, neurological deficits, or new-onset seizures. Larger RICs were associated with worse symptoms. According to a univariate analysis, DM (3% of patients), larger AVM volume, worse Spetzler-Martin grade, lack of AVM surgery prior to radiosurgery, lack of hemorrhage prior to radiosurgery, and smaller margin dose of radiation had significant associations with the presence of RICs. Hypertension (20%), patient sex, tobacco use, number of draining veins, superficial or deep location of the lesion, and AVM embolization prior to radiosurgery had no association with the presence of RICs. According to a multivariate analysis, larger AVM volume, worse Spetzler-Martin grade, and no AVM surgery prior to radiosurgery predicted the occurrence of an RIC. Diabetes mellitus had borderline significance. CONCLUSIONS: Vascular factors such as hypertension, patient sex, and tobacco use did not convey additional risks of radiotoxicity, but DM remained a possible cardiovascular risk factor in the development of RICs.",2012 Dec,2012,Journal of neurosurgery,117 Suppl,,144-9,eng,False,10.3171/2012.6.GKS1245;10.3171/2012.6.GKS1245,"Journal Article;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",Adult;Brain/*surgery;*Diabetes Complications;Diabetes Mellitus/surgery;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Headache/etiology;Humans;Hypertension/*complications/surgery;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects/instrumentation;Retrospective Studies;Risk Factors;Seizures/etiology,

We present its successful implementation for a radiosurgical complication after the treatment of a deep, large arteriovenous malformation. We also review the literature on hyperbaric oxygenation for radiation-induced complications. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 25-year-old man underwent radiosurgical treatment for a large arteriovenous malformation. Three years later, substantially smaller remaining nidus was retreated. Five months after that treatment, the patient developed edema around the nidus and hemiparesis. This problem was refractory to high-dose steroids. INTERVENTION: The patient underwent a course of 25 hyperbaric oxygenation treatments. Within 1 month, the edema and hemiparesis had improved, allowing steroids to be tapered. A follow-up examination 1 year later revealed complete thrombosis of the arteriovenous malformation and minimal neurological deficit.

RESULTS: The number of patients with ruptured or eloquently localized AVMs was more in combination of microsurgery + embolization. On the other hand, the duration, preoperative versus postoperative hemoglobin levels, and usage of blood products did not differ between treatment groups.

34293174,Does Variceal Drainage Affect Arteriovenous Malformation Obliteration and Hemorrhage Rates After Stereotactic Radiosurgery? A Case-Matched Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is widely accepted as a minimally invasive alternative to surgery in the management of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Dilated AVM outflow veins or varices may be caused by high-flow or partial outflow obstruction, which may increase the risk of a hemorrhage before or after SRS. OBJECTIVE: To compare the obliteration and hemorrhage risks in patients with and without AVM varices (AVMv). METHODS: From our prospective database of 1012 AVM patients who underwent Gamma Knife® (Elekta) SRS, we identified 103 patients with AVMv, and 847 patients without varices. The median follow-up was 52 mo. Balancing variable score matching was performed to compare obliteration and hemorrhage rates between the 2 groups. RESULTS: Obliteration rates in the AVMv group were 38% at 3 yr, 65% at 4 yr, and 70% at 5 yr. Patients with an AVMv had no difference in the final obliteration rate compared to patients who did not have variceal drainage (P = .35). Actuarial hemorrhage after SRS in the matched patients with AVMv was 4.9%, 13%, and 13.7%, at 1, 3, and 5 yr, respectively. The rate of hemorrhage in the group with no varix was 2.9%, 5.4%, and 9.1% at 1, 3, and 5 yr, respectively (P = .14). CONCLUSION: The presence of AVM variceal venous drainage did not affect the obliteration rate and did not confer a higher risk of a subsequent hemorrhage both before and after SRS.",2021 Sep 15,2021,Neurosurgery,89,4,680-685,eng,True,10.1093/neuros/nyab256;6325676;10.1093/neuros/nyab256,Journal Article,Drainage;Follow-Up Studies;Hemorrhage;Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/surgery;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome,Arteriovenous malformations;Hemorrhage;Radiosurgery;Varix
21345621,Pretreatment predictors of adverse radiation effects after radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformation.,"PURPOSE: To identify vascular and dosimetric predictors of symptomatic T2 signal change and adverse radiation effects after radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformation, in order to define and validate preexisting risk models. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 125 patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVM) were treated at our institution between 2005 and 2009. Eighty-five patients have at least 12 months of clinical and radiological follow-up. Any new-onset headaches, new or worsening seizures, or neurological deficit were considered adverse events. Follow-up magnetic resonance images were assessed for new onset T2 signal change and the volume calculated. Pretreatment characteristics and dosimetric variables were analyzed to identify predictors of adverse radiation effects. RESULTS: There were 19 children and 66 adults in the study cohort, with a mean age of 34 (range 6-74). Twenty-three (27%) patients suffered adverse radiation effects (ARE), 9 patients with permanent neurological deficit (10.6%). Of these, 5 developed fixed visual field deficits. Target volume and 12 Gy volume were the most significant predictors of adverse radiation effects on univariate analysis (p < 0.001). Location and cortical eloquence were not significantly associated with the development of adverse events (p = 0.12). No additional vascular parameters were identified as predictive of ARE. There was a significant target volume threshold of 4 cm(3), above which the rate of ARE increased dramatically. Multivariate analysis target volume and the absence of prior hemorrhage are the only significant predictors of ARE. The volume of T2 signal change correlates to ARE, but only target volume is predictive of a higher volume of T2 signal change. CONCLUSIONS: Target volume and the absence of prior hemorrhage is the most accurate predictor of adverse radiation effects and complications after radiosurgery for AVMs. A high percentage of permanent visual field defects in this series suggest the optic radiation is a critical radiosensitive structure.",2012 Feb 1,2012,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",82,2,803-8,eng,False,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2010.12.014;S0360-3016(10)03711-9;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2010.12.014,Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Analysis of Variance;Child;Female;Headache/etiology;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods;Male;Middle Aged;Paresis/etiology;Radiation Injuries/*diagnosis;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects/methods;Radiotherapy Dosage;Retrospective Studies;Risk Assessment/methods;Seizures/etiology;Vision Disorders/etiology;Young Adult,

11013088,Seizure control after radiosurgery on cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"Among 462 cases of cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) treated with gamma-radiosurgery, the initial presentations were haemorrhage in 68%, epilepsy in 12.8%, neurological deficits in 3.2%, minor symptoms in 7.6% and asymptomatic in 4.5% respectively. There were 79 cases (17.1%) who had had a convulsive seizure before radiosurgery and they were classified into two groups: 58 cases presented with seizure as an initial symptoms (group A) and the other 21 cases mostly had seizures following intracranial haemorrhage (group B). Before radiosurgery, generalised seizure was the predominant seizure pattern in both groups, followed by pure partial and complex partial seizures. There was no major difference in seizure patterns or seizure frequency in group A and B. At radiosurgery AVMs were treated with a mean maximum dose of 37.2 Gy and a marginal dose of 19.8 Gy. Seizures had apparently decreased in most of the cases at the last follow-up (mean 24 months) according to the obliteration of the nidus. Seizures were either decreased or had disappeared in 91.6% of group A and 62.5% of group B patients. The overall results indicate that seizures improved in 85.5%, were changed in 11.6% and deteriorated in 2.9% of patients. Radiosurgery is effective not only for the obliteration of nidus of cerebral AVM, but also for seizure control, even before complete occlusion of the nidus.",2000 Sep,2000,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society,7 Suppl 1,,6-9,eng,True,S096758680090701X;10.1054/jocn.2000.0701,Journal Article,Adult;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/*surgery;Middle Aged;*Radiosurgery/methods;Seizures/complications/*surgery;Treatment Outcome,
26587641,Surgical Strategies for Acutely Ruptured Arteriovenous Malformations.,"Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are focal neurovascular lesions consisting of abnormal fistulous connections between the arterial and venous systems with no interposed capillaries. This arrangement creates a high-flow circulatory shunt with hemorrhagic risk and hemodynamic abnormalities. While most AVMs are asymptomatic, they may cause severe neurological complications and death. Each AVM carries an annual rupture risk of 2-4%. Intracranial hemorrhage due to AVM rupture is the most common initial manifestation (up to 70% of presentations), and it carries significant morbidity and mortality. This complication is particularly important in the young and otherwise healthy population, in whom AVMs cause up to one-third of all hemorrhagic strokes. A previous rupture is the single most important independent predictor of future hemorrhage. Current treatment modalities for AVM are microsurgery, endovascular embolization, and radiosurgery. In acutely ruptured AVMs, early microsurgical excision is usually avoided. The standard is to wait at least 4 weeks to allow for patient recovery, hematoma liquefaction, and inflammatory reactions to subside. Exceptions to this rule are small, superficial, low-grade AVMs with elucidated angioarchitecture, for which early simultaneous hematoma evacuation and AVM excision is feasible. Emergent hematoma evacuation with delayed AVM excision (unless, as mentioned, the AVM is low grade) is recommended in patients with a decreased level of consciousness due to intracranial hemorrhage, posterior fossa or temporal lobe hematoma of >30 ml, or hemispheric hematoma of >60 ml. The applicability of endovascular techniques for acutely ruptured AVMs is not clear, but feasible options, until a definitive treatment is determined, include occluding intranidal and distal flow-related aneurysms and 'sealing' any rupture site or focal angioarchitectural weakness when one can be clearly identified and safely accessed. Radiosurgery is not performed in acutely ruptured AVMs because its therapeutic effects occur in a delayed fashion.",2015,2015,Frontiers of neurology and neuroscience,37,,166-81,eng,False,10.1159/000437121;000437121;10.1159/000437121,Journal Article,"Acute Disease;*Embolization, Therapeutic;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/*surgery;Intracranial Hemorrhages/diagnosis/*surgery;*Radiosurgery/methods;Treatment Outcome",
35876672,Stereotactic Radiosurgery Provides Long-Term Safety for Patients With Arteriovenous Malformations in the Diencephalon and Brainstem: The Optimal Dose Selection and Long-Term Outcomes.,"BACKGROUND: Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the diencephalon (DC) and brainstem (BS) are difficult to treat. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a reasonable option; however, an optimal radiosurgical dose needs to be established to optimize long-term outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate dose-dependent long-term outcomes of SRS for DC/BS-AVMs. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the long-term outcomes of 118 patients who had SRS-treated DC/BS-AVMs. The outcomes included post-SRS hemorrhage, AVM obliteration, neurological outcomes, and disease-specific survival. According to margin doses, the patients were classified into low (<18 Gy), medium (18-20 Gy), and high (>20 Gy) dose groups. RESULTS: SRS reduced the annual hemorrhage rate from 8.6% to 1.6% before obliteration and 0.0% after obliteration. The cumulative hemorrhage rate in the low dose group was likely to be higher than that in the other groups ( P = .113). The cumulative obliteration rates in the entire cohort were 74% and 83% at 5 and 10 years, respectively, and were significantly lower in the low dose group than in the other groups (vs medium dose: P = .027, vs high dose: P = .016). Multivariate analyses demonstrated that low dose SRS was significantly associated with worse obliteration rates (hazard ratio 0.18, 95% CI 0.04-0.79; P = .023). CONCLUSION: SRS with a margin dose of 18 to 20 Gy for DC/BS-AVMs may be optimal, providing a higher obliteration rate and lower risk of post-SRS hemorrhage than lower dose SRS. Dose reduction to <18 Gy should only be optional when higher doses are intolerable.",2022 Sep 1,2022,Neurosurgery,91,3,485-495,eng,True,10.1227/neu.0000000000002064;00006123-202209000-00015;10.1227/neu.0000000000002064,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Brain Stem;Diencephalon;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/etiology/radiotherapy/surgery;Margins of Excision;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome,

METHODS: Fourteen patients with Spetzler Martin (SM) grades IV and V large AVMs who underwent HFSRT between January 2013 and July 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. All patients received HFSRT at a dose of 30-36 Gy in 5 to 6 fractions. They were followed up annually with clinical and imaging assessments to evaluate obliteration rates. RESULTS: The median age at presentation was 15 years (range 8-21 years). Ten (71%) were SM grade 4 AVMs and the rest were SM grade 5 AVMs. The majority presented with headache (8 [57%]), and 3 (21%) presented with bleeding. The median nidus volume was 39.4 cc (IQR, 31.4-52.4). Two (14%) patients had infratentorial AVMs. All of them had deep venous drainage. The median clinical follow-up duration was 75 months (range 31-107 months). There was complete obliteration of the nidus in 3 (21%) patients with a median time to obliteration of 39 months. HFSRT resulted in a reduction of the AVM volume to 12 cc or less in nearly 70% of patients. None of the patients experienced re-bleeding. 79% reported an improvement in their symptoms. CONCLUSION: HFSRT is a highly effective treatment for high-grade AVMs in children, which can result in either complete elimination or significant reduction of the nidus volume or make it suitable for additional treatment, such as single-session stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).",2024 Apr,2024,Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for,40,4,1185-1192,eng,False,10.1007/s00381-023-06244-0;10.1007/s00381-023-06244-0;10.1007/s00381-023-06244-0,Journal Article,Humans;Child;Adolescent;Young Adult;Adult;Retrospective Studies;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery;*Radiosurgery/methods;Treatment Outcome;Radiation Dose Hypofractionation;Follow-Up Studies,Arteriovenous malformations;Hypofractionated;Pediatric;Radiotherapy;Stereotactic
26355435,Radiosurgery for Large Arteriovenous Malformations as a Single-Session or Staged Treatment.,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The treatment of large arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) presents a challenge and the effectiveness of radiosurgery decreases with increasing treatment volume. Here, we analyzed and compared single-session treatment for AVMs >15 cm3 with staged treatment, when the volume of a large AVM was divided into 2 or more compartments, which were subsequently treated at intervals of a few months. In the event that complete obliteration was not achieved within 3 years, repeat radiosurgery was considered. METHODS/RESULTS: Between 1993 and 2011, gamma-knife radiosurgery was performed on 50 patients with large AVMs. A total of 27 of them, with volumes ranging from 15.1 to 27 cm3 (median = 17.8), were treated in a single session, with a marginal dose ranging from 10 to 17 Gy (median = 15). Complete obliteration was achieved in 7 (26%) of these; in 14 patients the treatment was repeated after a median of 38 months. The volume of AVMs subjected to repeat treatment regressed and ranged from 6.76 to 16.4 cm3 (median = 7.7), with the marginal dose ranging from 13 to 18 Gy (median = 17); 10 patients later achieved complete obliteration at a median of 79 months after the initial treatment. Overall, 63% of patients achieved complete obliteration of AVM after treatment. Rebleeding in a latent period was recorded in 3 patients (11%) and symptomatic collateral edema in 2 (7%); 23 patients were treated using the staged method, with the interval between staged treatments usually being 6 months. Their overall AVM volume ranged from 13.2 to 46.6 cm3 (median = 23.3), the volume for a single stage ranged from 4.5 to 31.3 cm3 (median 11.7), and the marginal dose ranged from 10 to 18 Gy (median = 17). Complete obliteration was achieved in 4 (17%) of them, in 8 patients the treatment was repeated at a median of 53 months after the first treatment, and a third retreatment was performed on 2 patients 98 and 102 months, respectively, after the first treatment. The volume for repeated treatment of AVMs ranged from 0.81 to 7.7 cm3 (median = 3.3), with the marginal dose ranging from 14 to 20 Gy (median 17.5). Of all the retreated patients, 5 AVMs subsequently achieved complete obliteration. Overall, 9 patients (39%) were totally cured. Rebleeding in a latent period was observed in 1 of these patients (4.3%) and symptomatic edema in another 1 (4.3%).

32859467,Radiotherapy of non-tumoral refractory neurological pathologies.,"Intracranial radiotherapy has been improved, primarily because of the development of stereotactic approaches. While intracranial stereotactic body radiotherapy is mainly indicated for treatment of benign or malignant tumors, this procedure is also effective in the management of other neurological pathologies; it is delivered using GammaKnife® and linear accelerators. Thus, brain arteriovenous malformations in patients who are likely to experience permanent neurological sequelae can be managed by single session intracranial stereotactic body radiotherapy, or radiosurgery, in specific situations, with an advantageous benefit/risk ratio. Radiosurgery can be recommended for patients with disabling symptoms, which are poorly controlled by medication, such as trigeminal neuralgia, and tremors, whether they are essential or secondary to Parkinson's disease. This literature review aims at defining the place of intracranial stereotactic body radiotherapy in the management of patients suffering from non-tumoral refractory neurological pathologies. It is clear that the multidisciplinary collaboration of experienced teams from Neurosurgery, Neurology, Neuroradiology, Radiation Oncology and Medical Physics is needed for the procedures using high precision radiotherapy techniques, which deliver high doses to locations near functional brain areas.",2020 Oct,2020,Cancer radiotherapie : journal de la Societe francaise de radiotherapie,24,6-7,523-533,eng,False,S1278-3218(20)30182-7;10.1016/j.canrad.2020.06.012;S1278-3218(20)30182-7;10.1016/j.canrad.2020.06.012,Journal Article;Review,Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*radiotherapy;*Radiosurgery;Trigeminal Neuralgia/*radiotherapy,Arteriovenous malformations;Malformations artérioveineuses;Névralgie faciale;Radiotherapy;Radiothérapie;Tremblement;Tremor;Trigeminal neuralgia
29882061,Combined treatment approach to cerebral arteriovenous malformation in pediatric patients: stereotactic radiosurgery to partially Onyx-embolized AVM.,"PURPOSE: Treatment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM)-the most common cause of stroke in the pediatric population-can be challenging due to the complexity of size, morphology, and location. There is a significant risk in comparison to AVM treatment among adults. Thus, AVM treatment in the pediatric population imposes unique challenges. Recent improvements include optimized catheter techniques and better embolization materials, such as Onyx, a non-adhesive liquid embolic agent used in the adult population. These improvements have increased the success rate of total and near-total obliteration of cerebral AVM. However, the use of Onyx causes significant distortion of the MR and CT images, which must be accounted for in any radiation treatment planning predicated on CT and MRI. These image distortions impact on the actual delivered dose to the nidus and behoove heterogeneity correction. Our group has previously shared a solution for heterogeneity correction in the adult population. The purpose of this study is to show our experience in this unique group of pediatric patients. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of pediatric patients, who were undergoing combined endovascular embolization followed by SRS. The cohort consists of 14 patients undergoing SRS treatment in our institute between November 2006 and December 2012 with a mean follow-up of 49.9 months. Within this cohort, we retrospectively reviewed 12 consecutive pediatric patients who underwent a combined endovascular and SRS approach with a mean follow-up of 52.1 months and two patients receiving SRS-only treatment were excluded. RESULTS: In our cohort of 14 patients, 7 (50%) were male, with a mean age of 17.3 years (12.0-22.9) at the time of radiosurgery treatment. Mean age of beginning the combined modality treatment was 15.3 years (8.4-20). The median time from diagnosis to SRS was 24.3 months (11.1-64.4 months) in the complete cohort and 25.6 months (11.1-64.4) in the multimodality group. The overall median follow-up period was 49.9 months (range 12.8-118.8 months) in the complete cohort and 52.1 months (range 12.8-118.8 months) in the multimodality group. Eleven (78.6%) patients had at least one episode of hemorrhage prior to treatment. Spezler-Martin grades at baseline ranged from 2 to 5 (mean 3.2). Fifty percent had grade IV and V. Patients underwent a median of 2 (range 1-5) embolization procedures. The radiosurgical treatment dose to the margin of the angiography-based nidus: median prescription dose of 21.49 Gy (14.39-27.51) with a median max dose of 27.77 Gy (18.93-32.52). The median treatment volume was 0.6 cm(3) (0.1-7.3 cm(3)). The Onyx embolization reduced the nidus target volume by a median of 66.7% (12.0-92.7%). We confirmed 10/14 (71%) complete closures. In 2/14 (14.2%) additional patients, a significant flow reduction was noted. In 1/14 (7.1%) patients, no significant change was noted during the observation period and two (14.2%) patients were without follow-up information. In two patients, post-treatment edema was noted; however, none was clinically significant and resolved without additional intervention or treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This cohort comprises the largest combined Onyx-SRS pediatric experience in the literature. In conjunction with our adult group study, we show that the use of Onyx reduces the SRS treatment target volume significantly. Importantly, we implemented the heterogeneity correction to avoid increased radiation exposure to normal surrounding brain tissue. The combined approach appears to be safe provided that the above-mentioned corrections are implemented.",2018 Nov,2018,Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for,34,11,2269-2274,eng,False,10.1007/s00381-018-3854-2;10.1007/s00381-018-3854-2;10.1007/s00381-018-3854-2,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Child;Cohort Studies;Combined Modality Therapy/*methods;Dimethyl Sulfoxide/therapeutic use;Embolization, Therapeutic/*methods;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*therapy;Male;Polyvinyls/therapeutic use;Radiosurgery/*methods;Retrospective Studies;Young Adult",Arteriovenous malformation (AVM);Onyx-embolization;Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)
11013106,Strategic embolisation for successful resection of a large cerebral arteriovenous malformation.,"The risks accompanied by the treatment of cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) are still cumulative despite recent progress in available treatment options. Pre-operative embolisation is one such option, however, it seldom makes the surgical resection difficult. The excessive embolised nidus makes the surgical resection difficult because it cannot be compressed during the resection surgery and embolised nidus as a 'glue ball' with marginal hypervascular territory is most difficult to remove. The aim of pre-operative embolisation for successful surgical resection is to put glue into the marginal part of the nidus so as to make a cleavage between the surrounding normal tissues. Remaining feedings via the dilatated leptomeningeal anastomoses from surrounding normal cortical arteries do not interfere with the resection and can be eliminated easily by coagulating the pia matter around the nidus. Strategic planning with regard to the systemic course of treatment, including the manner of resection, is important for effective pre-operative embolisation.",2000 Sep,2000,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society,7 Suppl 1,,86-7,eng,False,S0967586800907197;10.1054/jocn.2000.0719,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Adult;Combined Modality Therapy;*Embolization, Therapeutic/methods;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/surgery/*therapy;Male;Radiosurgery",
23082882,Long-term outcome of Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations graded by the Spetzler-Martin classification.,"OBJECT: The object of this study was to assess outcomes in patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) treated by Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS); lesions were stratified by size, symptomatology, and Spetzler-Martin (S-M) grade. METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective analysis of 102 patients treated for an AVM with single-dose or staged-dose SRS between 1993 and 2004. Lesions were grouped by S-M grade, as hemorrhagic or nonhemorrhagic, and as small (< 3 cm) or large (≥ 3 cm). Outcomes included death, morbidity (new neurological deficit, new-onset seizure, or hemorrhage/rehemorrhage), nidus obliteration, and Karnofsky Performance Scale score. RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 8.5 years (range 5-16 years). Overall nidus obliteration (achieved in 75% of patients) and morbidity (19%) correlated with lesion size and S-M grade. For S-M Grade I-III AVMs, nonhemorrhagic and hemorrhagic combined, treatment yielded obliteration rates of 100%, 89%, and 86%, respectively; high functional status (Karnofsky Performance Scale Score ≥ 80); and 1% mortality. For S-M Grade IV and V AVMs, outcomes were less favorable, with obliteration rates of 54% and 0%, respectively. The AVMs that were not obliterated had a mean reduction in nidus volume of 69% (range 35%-96%). On long-term follow-up, 10% of patients experienced hemorrhage/rehemorrhage (6% mortality rate), which correlated with lesion size and S-M grade; the mean interval to hemorrhage was 81 months. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with S-M Grade I-III AVMs, SRS offers outcomes that are favorable and that, except for the timing of obliteration, appear to be comparable to surgical outcomes reported for the same S-M grades.

The aim of this multicenter, retrospective cohort study is to compare the SRS outcomes for unruptured versus ruptured pediatric AVMs. Methods- The International Radiosurgery Research Foundation pediatric AVM database from 1987 to 2018 was reviewed retrospectively. Favorable outcome was defined as AVM obliteration, no post-SRS hemorrhage, and no permanently symptomatic radiation-induced changes. Associations between prior hemorrhage and outcomes were adjusted for baseline differences, inverse probability weights, and competing risks. Results- The study cohort comprised 153 unruptured and 386 ruptured AVMs. Favorable outcome was achieved in 48.4% and 60.4% of unruptured and ruptured AVMs, respectively (adjusted odds ratio, 1.353; P=0.190). Cumulative AVM obliteration probabilities were 51.2%, 59.4%, 64.2%, and 70.0% for unruptured and 61.0%, 69.3%, 74.0%, and 79.3% for ruptured AVMs at 4, 6, 8, and 10 years, respectively (subhazard ratio, 1.311; P=0.020). Cumulative post-SRS hemorrhage probabilities were 4.5%, 5.6%, 5.6%, and 9.8% for unruptured and 4.7%, 6.1%, 6.1%, and 10.6% for ruptured AVMs at 4, 6, 8, and 10 years, respectively (subhazard ratio, 1.086; P=0.825). Probabilities of AVM obliteration (adjusted subhazard ratio, 0.968; P=0.850) and post-SRS hemorrhage (adjusted subhazard ratio, 1.663; P=0.251) were comparable between the 2 cohorts after inverse probability weight adjustments. Symptomatic (15.8% versus 8.1%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.400; P=0.008) and permanent (9.2% versus 5.0%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.441; P=0.045) radiation-induced change were more common in unruptured AVMs. Conclusions- The overall outcomes after SRS for unruptured versus ruptured pediatric AVMs are comparable.

Targets defined by different imaging modalities may be inconsistent in practice. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study is to review and analyze the consistency between targets defined by different imaging modalities in radiosurgery for AVMs. METHODS: From March 2007 to June 2011, AVM patients for radiosurgery whose targets were delineated by angiography/computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were reviewed. Spetzler-Martin grades, hemorrhage history, and treatment volumes were checked. Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) between targets were calculated and analyzed. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were enrolled. The mean DSCs were between 0.37 and 0.51 for targets by different modalities. There was no significant difference in DSCs regarding Spetzler-Martin grades and hemorrhage history. For CT-delineated target volumes <3 cm3, MRI-delineated target volumes <5 cm3, and angiography-delineated target volumes <2 cm3, the DSCs between the different image modalities were significantly decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Consistency between targets delineated using different image modalities was likely to be unsatisfactory and worsen significantly in niduses with volumes <5 cm3.

METHODS: In 219 patients who underwent SRS during the period from 1990 to 2016, the Supp-SM grade was calculated for SM grade III (n = 154) or SM grade IV-V (n = 65) AVMs. The Supp-SM grades in these patients were 4 (n = 14, 6%), 5 (n = 36, 16%), 6 (n = 67, 31%), 7 (n = 76, 35%), and 8-9 (n = 26, 12%). Sixty patients (27%) had deep AVMs (basal ganglia, thalamus, or brainstem). Thirty-nine patients (18%) had volume-staged SRS; 41 patients (19%) underwent repeat SRS. The median follow-up period was 69 months for SM grade III AVMs and 113 months for SM grade IV-V AVMs. RESULTS: AVM obliteration was confirmed in 163 patients (74%) at a median of 38 months after initial SRS. The obliteration rates at 4 and 8 years were 59% and 76%, respectively. Thirty-one patients (14%) had post-SRS deficits from hemorrhage (n = 7, 3%) or radiation injury (n = 24, 11%). Six patients (3%) died after SRS (hemorrhage, n = 5; radiation injury, n = 1). The rates of neurological decline or death at 4 and 8 years were 11% and 18%, respectively. Factors predictive of nonobliteration were deep location (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.39-0.82, p = 0.003) and increasing AVM volume (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.93-0.99, p = 0.002). Increasing AVM volume was the only factor associated with neurological decline (HR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02-1.08, p = 0.002). The Supp-SM grading score did not correlate with either obliteration (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.82-1.09, p = 0.43) or neurological decline (HR 1.15, 95% CI 0.84-1.56, p = 0.38). CONCLUSIONS: The Supp-SM grading system was not predictive of outcomes after SRS of intermediate- or high-grade AVM. In a cohort that included a high percentage (47%) of ""inoperable"" AVMs according to Supp-SM grade (≥ 7), most patients had obliteration after SRS, although there was a high risk of neurological decline.",2023 Mar 1,2023,Journal of neurosurgery,138,3,804-809,eng,True,10.3171/2022.5.JNS22761;10.3171/2022.5.JNS22761,Journal Article,Humans;Follow-Up Studies;Treatment Outcome;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects;Retrospective Studies;*Radiation Injuries/etiology,arteriovenous malformation;complication;outcomes;stereotactic radiosurgery;vascular disorders
31201498,Long-term outcomes in pediatric unruptured brain arteriovenous malformation treated by nonconservative management: a single center analysis.,"PURPOSE: The best management of pediatric unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations (ubAVM) should be further elucidated. METHODS: Pediatric patients who presented to our facility with ubAVM and were treated nonconservatively were retrospectively analyzed regarding demographics, presenting symptoms, AVM characteristics, treatment modality, and outcome. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were included. There were 9 male and 4 female patients with an average age (± SD) of 7.8 ± 4.6 years. The most common presenting symptom was seizure. The mean Spetzler Martin (SM) grade was 3.2. Seven patients were treated by surgical excision, 8 by embolization, 6 by radiosurgery, and during the mean follow-up period of 8.9 years (2.6-14.4 years), there were no hemorrhage. Complete ubAVM obliteration was achieved in all 7 patients (100%) who underwent surgical excision. AVM was obliterated in 5 out of 9 patients whose SM grade was 3 or 4. Modified Rankin scale was good (mRS 0-2) in all 13 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Since the lifetime hemorrhage rate of pediatric ubAVM is high, it may be better to proceed with nonconservative treatment, especially when surgical excision is amenable. Nonconservative treatment could be an appropriate treatment with acceptable neurological outcome even in those with moderate to high-grade AVMs in selected cases.",2019 Aug,2019,Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for,35,8,1363-1369,eng,False,10.1007/s00381-019-04221-0;10.1007/s00381-019-04221-0;10.1007/s00381-019-04221-0,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Arteriovenous Fistula/*therapy;Child;Embolization, Therapeutic/*methods;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*therapy;Male;Neurosurgical Procedures/*methods;Radiosurgery/*methods;Retrospective Studies;Time;Treatment Outcome",Brain arteriovenous malformation;Nonconservative management;Unruptured AVM

20871453,Stereotactic radiosurgery with or without embolization for intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas.,"BACKGROUND: Treatment options for dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) have expanded with the application of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). OBJECTIVE: To assess the role of SRS with or without embolization, we reviewed our entire DAVF experience. METHODS: Between 1991 and 2006, 40 patients with 44 DAVFs underwent Gamma knife SRS. Twenty-eight patients had upfront SRS before or after embolization and 12 patients underwent delayed SRS for recurrent or residual DAVFs after initial embolization. The median patient age was 60 years (range, 29-90). DAVFs were diagnosed in 7 patients after they sustained an intracranial hemorrhage. The median SRS target volume was 2.0 mL (range, 0.2-8.2 mL) and the median marginal dose was 21.0 Gy (range, 15-25 Gy). RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 45 months (range, 23-116 mo), a total of 28 patients (harboring 32 DAVFs) had obliteration confirmed by imaging. We found a 83% obliteration rate in patients who had upfront SRS with embolization and a 67% obliteration rate in patients who only had SRS. One patient died of an intracerebral hemorrhage 2 months after SRS. Cavernous carotid fistulas were associated with higher rates of occlusion (P = .012) and symptom improvement (P = .010) than were transverse-sigmoid sinus-related fistulas. CONCLUSION: When upfront SRS is possible in conjunction with embolization, successful DAVF obliteration is possible in most patients, especially those with carotid cavernous fistulas. SRS should target the entire fistula regardless of whether it precedes or follows embolization. In selected patients with a small-volume, low-risk DAVF, SRS alone is an effective treatment option in most patients.",2010 Nov,2010,Neurosurgery,67,5,1276-83; discussion 1284-5,eng,False,10.1227/NEU.0b013e3181ef3f22;10.1227/NEU.0b013e3181ef3f22,Controlled Clinical Trial;Journal Article,"Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Arteriovenous Fistula/*therapy;Combined Modality Therapy;Embolization, Therapeutic/*methods;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*therapy;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/*methods;Treatment Outcome",
30117771,Multimodal management of arteriovenous malformations of the basal ganglia and thalamus: factors affecting obliteration and outcome.,"OBJECTIVE: Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the basal ganglia and thalamus are particularly difficult lesions to treat, accounting for 3%-13% of all AVMs in surgical series and 23%-44% of malformations in radiosurgery series. The goal of this study was to report the results of multimodal management of basal ganglia and thalamic AVMs and investigate the factors that influence radiographic cure and good clinical outcomes. METHODS: This study was a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database of all patients treated at the authors' institution. Clinical, radiological, follow-up, and outcome data were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to explore the influence of various factors on outcome. RESULTS: The results and data analysis pertaining to 123 patients treated over 32 years are presented. In this cohort, radiographic cure was achieved in 50.9% of the patients. Seventy-five percent of patients had good clinical outcomes (stable or improved performance scores), whereas 25% worsened after treatment. Inclusion of surgery and radiosurgery independently predicted obliteration, whereas nidus diameter and volume predicted clinical outcomes. Nidus volume/diameter and inclusion of surgery predicted the optimal outcome, i.e., good clinical outcomes with lesion obliteration. CONCLUSIONS: Good outcomes are possible with multimodal treatment in these complex patients. Increasing size and, by extension, higher Spetzler-Martin grade are associated with worse outcomes. Inclusion of multiple modalities of treatment as indicated could improve the chances of radiographic cure and good outcomes.",2019 Aug 1,2019,Journal of neurosurgery,131,2,410-419,eng,True,2018.2.JNS172511;10.3171/2018.2.JNS172511;2018.2.JNS172511;10.3171/2018.2.JNS172511,Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Arteriovenous Fistula/*diagnostic imaging/*therapy;Basal Ganglia/*diagnostic imaging;Combined Modality Therapy/methods;Disease Management;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnostic imaging/*therapy;Male;Neurosurgical Procedures/methods/trends;Prospective Studies;Radiosurgery/methods/trends;Retrospective Studies;Thalamus/*diagnostic imaging;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult,AVM = arteriovenous malformation;BGT = basal ganglia and thalamus;EVT = endovascular treatment;GKS = Gamma Knife surgery;LINAC = linear accelerator;PostTP = posttreatment period;PreTP = pretreatment period;SRS = stereotactic radiosurgery;arteriovenous malformation;basal ganglia;mRS = modified Rankin Scale;microsurgery;multimodal treatment;radiosurgery;thalamus;vascular disorders

21771938,Brain arteriovenous malformations.,"An arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a particular abnormality of blood vessels. Brain AVMs are congenital, but symptoms usually do not appear until the second decade of life - if at all. The most common presenting symptom is a brain hemorrhage, but other possible symptoms include neurological deficits, seizures and headaches. Until recently, the gold standard for diagnosing AVM was conventional angiography. However, computed tomography and magnetic resonance angiography are now the first-line diagnostic tools for AVMs. This article reviews the presenting symptoms, diagnostic procedures and treatment options for brain AVMs, including embolization, micro-surgery and radiosurgery.

36700732,"Comparison of Single-Session, Neoadjuvant, and Adjuvant Embolization Gamma Knife Radiosurgery for Arteriovenous Malformation.","BACKGROUND: The purpose of intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) treatment is to prevent bleeding or subsequent hemorrhage with complete obliteration. For large, difficult-to-treat AVMs, multimodal approaches including surgery, endovascular embolization, and gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) are frequently used. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the outcomes of AVMs treated with single-session, neoadjuvant, and adjuvant embolization GKRS. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed a database of 453 patients with AVMs who underwent GKRS between January 2007 and December 2017 at our facility. The obliteration rate, incidence of latent period bleeding, cyst formation, and radiation-induced changes were compared among the 3 groups, neoadjuvant-embolized, adjuvant-embolized, nonembolized group. In addition, the variables predicting AVM obliteration and complications were investigated. RESULTS: A total of 228 patients were enrolled in this study. The neoadjuvant-embolized, adjuvant-embolized, and nonembolized groups comprised 29 (12.7%), 19 (8.3%), and 180 (78.9%) patients, respectively. Significant differences were detected among the 3 groups in the history of previous hemorrhage and the presence of aneurysms ( P < .0001). Multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed a significant inverse correlation between neoadjuvant embolization and obliteration occurring 36 months after GKRS (hazard ratio, 0.326; P = .006). CONCLUSION: GKRS with either neoadjuvant or adjuvant embolization is a beneficial approach for the treatment of AVMs with highly complex angioarchitectures that are at risk for hemorrhage during the latency period. Embolization before GKRS may be a negative predictive factor for late-stage obliteration (>36 months). To confirm our conclusions, further studies involving a larger number of patients and continuous follow-up are necessary.",2023 May 1,2023,Neurosurgery,92,5,986-997,eng,True,10.1227/neu.0000000000002308;00006123-202305000-00011;10.1227/neu.0000000000002308,Journal Article,Humans;Treatment Outcome;Retrospective Studies;Neoadjuvant Therapy;*Radiosurgery;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications;Follow-Up Studies,
24726288,Single-fraction proton beam stereotactic radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE(S): To evaluate the obliteration rate and potential adverse effects of single-fraction proton beam stereotactic radiosurgery (PSRS) in patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). METHODS AND MATERIALS: From 1991 to 2010, 248 consecutive patients with 254 cerebral AVMs received single-fraction PSRS at our institution. The median AVM nidus volume was 3.5 cc (range, 0.1-28.1 cc), 23% of AVMs were in critical/deep locations (basal ganglia, thalamus, or brainstem), and the most common prescription dose was 15 Gy(relative biological effectiveness [RBE]). Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to assess factors associated with obliteration and hemorrhage. RESULTS: At a median follow-up time of 35 months (range, 6-198 months), 64.6% of AVMs were obliterated. The median time to total obliteration was 31 months (range, 6-127 months), and the 5-year and 10-year cumulative incidence of total obliteration was 70% and 91%, respectively. On univariable analysis, smaller target volume (hazard ratio [HR] 0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.86-0.93, P<.0001), smaller treatment volume (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.90-0.96, P<.0001), higher prescription dose (HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.07-1.26, P=.001), and higher maximum dose (HR 1.14, 95% CI 1.05-1.23, P=.002) were associated with total obliteration. Deep/critical location was also associated with decreased likelihood of obliteration (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.47-0.98, P=.04). On multivariable analysis, critical location (adjusted HR [AHR] 0.42, 95% CI 0.27-0.65, P<.001) and smaller target volume (AHR 0.81, 95% CI 0.68-0.97, P=.02) remained associated with total obliteration. Posttreatment hemorrhage occurred in 13 cases (5-year cumulative incidence of 7%), all among patients with less than total obliteration, and 3 of these events were fatal. The most common complication was seizure, controlled with medications, both acutely (8%) and in the long term (9.1%). CONCLUSIONS: The current series is the largest modern series of PSRS for cerebral AVMs. PSRS can achieve a high obliteration rate with minimal morbidity.

29040773,Treatment Outcomes of A Randomized Trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformation-Eligible Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformation Patients.,"BACKGROUND: The guideline for treating unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations (ubAVMs) remains controversial. A Randomized Trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformations (ARUBA) reported lower risk of stroke or death with conservative management compared to interventional treatment. There were numerous limitations to the study, including short follow-up period and disproportionate number of patients treated with surgery and embolization. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether treatment of ARUBA-eligible patients have acceptable outcomes at our institution. METHODS: Retrospective analysis was performed on 673 patients with brain AVMs treated at our institution between 2001 and 2014. One hundred five patients were ARUBA eligible and included in the study. Patients were divided into the microsurgery or Gamma Knife Radiosurgery (GKS; Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden) arm depending on their final treatment. Mean follow-up period was 43 mo (range 4-136 mo). Primary outcome was stroke or death. RESULTS: A total of 8 (7.6%) patients had a stroke or died. The overall risk of stroke or death was 11.4% (5 of 44 patients) for the microsurgery arm and 4.9% (3 of 61 patients) for the GKS arm. The annual rates of stroke or death were 2.1%, 4.0%, and 1.2% for the entire patient cohort, microsurgery arm, and GKS arm, respectively. AVM obliteration rates at the end of the follow-up period were 95.5% and 47.5% for the microsurgery and GKS arms, respectively. CONCLUSION: We report a lower overall risk of stroke or death in our ARUBA-eligible patients following treatment than ARUBA.

34303557,The Irradiated Brain Volume Within 12 Gy Is a Predictor for Radiation-Induced Changes After Stereotactic Radiosurgery in Patients With Unruptured Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformations.,"PURPOSE: Our purpose was to determine whether the coverage of brain parenchyma within the 12 Gy radiosurgical volume (V12) correlates with the development of radiation-induced changes (RICs) in patients with unruptured cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM) after undergoing stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). METHODS AND MATERIALS: This study conducted regular follow-up examinations of 165 patients with unruptured AVMs who had previously undergone SRS. The RICs identified in T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans at any time point in the first 3 years after SRS were labeled ""early RICs."" The RICs identified in T2-weighted MRI scans at 5-year follow-up brain images were labeled ""late RICs."" Fully automated segmentation was used to analyze the MRI scans from these patients, whereupon the volume and proportion of brain parenchyma within the V12 was calculated. Logistic regression analysis was used to characterize the factors affecting the incidence of early and late RICs of any grade after SRS. RESULTS: The median duration of follow-up was 70 months (range, 36-222). Early RICs were identified in 124 of the 165 patients with the highest grades as followed: grade 1 (103 patients), grade 2 (19 patients), and grade 3 (2 patients). Only 103 patients had more than 5 years follow-up, and late RICs were identified in 70 of 103 patients. Seventeen of 70 patients with late RICs were symptomatic. The median volume and proportion of brain parenchyma within the V12 was 22.4 cm(3) (range, 0.6-63.9) and 58.7% (range, 18.4-76.8). Univariate analysis revealed that AVM volume and the brain volume within the V12 were correlated with the incidence of both early and late RICs after SRS. Multivariable analysis revealed that only the brain volume within the V12 was significantly associated with the incidence of early and late RICs after SRS. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with unruptured AVM, the volume of brain parenchyma within the V12 was an important factor associated with the incidence of early and late RICs after SRS. Before SRS, meticulous radiosurgical planning to reduce brain parenchyma coverage within the V12 could reduce the risk of complications.",2021 Nov 1,2021,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",111,3,785-793,eng,False,S0360-3016(21)00679-9;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2021.05.135;S0360-3016(21)00679-9;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2021.05.135,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Brain/diagnostic imaging;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/radiotherapy;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome,
37074063,Risk for Brain Arteriovenous Malformation Rupture During Pregnancy and Puerperium.,"BACKGROUND: The hemorrhage risk of unruptured and untreated cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) has been shown to be higher for female patients than male patients in their child bearing ages. Although it has been neurosurgical practice to advise female patients in their childbearing ages to postpone pregnancy until proven AVM obliteration, there is no literature consensus regarding this potential hemorrhage risk increase. OBJECTIVE: To accurately quantify the risk increase for AVM hemorrhage during pregnancy. METHODS: This study is based on data from previous publications, consisting of known age at the first AVM hemorrhage in 3425 patients. The risk increase during pregnancy could be calculated from the difference in age distribution for the first AVM hemorrhage between male patients and female patients, taking the average pregnancy time per female into account. A comparison was also made with data for all hospital discharges (13 751) in Germany 2008 to 2018 with the diagnosis brain AVM. RESULTS: The average pregnancy and puerperium time was 1.54 years per female in the patient population, which was used to determine the annual AVM hemorrhage risk during pregnancy to be around 9%. The increased risk during pregnancy was further evidenced by analysis of a subgroup of 105 female patients, for which pregnancy status at the time of hemorrhage was known. CONCLUSION: The quantified annual risk for AVM hemorrhage during pregnancy is about 3 times higher than that of male patients at corresponding age. This provides an important basis for advising female patients with patent AVMs about the increased risk for hemorrhage that a pregnancy would entail.",2023 Oct 1,2023,Neurosurgery,93,4,918-923,eng,False,10.1227/neu.0000000000002496;00006123-202310000-00024;10.1227/neu.0000000000002496,Journal Article,Humans;Male;Female;Pregnancy;Postpartum Period;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/epidemiology/diagnosis;Rupture;Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects;Brain;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome,
21512177,Hemorrhage risk of cerebral arteriovenous malformations before and during the latency period after GAMMA knife radiosurgery.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To evaluate the hemorrhage rates of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM) and the risk factors of hemorrhage before and after Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKS). METHODS: The annual hemorrhage rate was calculated as the number of hemorrhages divided by the patient-years at risk. Characteristics of patients and AVM related to hemorrhagic or nonhemorrhagic presentation were evaluated by logistic regression. Risk factors predicting AVM hemorrhage during the period from the diagnosis to GKS of AVM and during the latency period after radiosurgery were evaluated using Cox regression hazards model. RESULTS: The annual hemorrhage rate before GKS was 2.0% assuming patients were at risk for hemorrhage since their birth. The hemorrhage rate calculated between the diagnosis and GKS of AVM was 6.6% and reduced to 2.5% after GKS until obliteration of the AVM. Although small and deep nidi and those with deep and single draining veins tended to present themselves with hemorrhage, only nidi with single draining veins and those ruptured before were more likely to bleed once the AVM had been diagnosed. These factors no longer predisposed the nidus to a rupture after radiosurgery and the only predicting factor for hemorrhage was a low radiosurgical prescription dose to the margin of nidus. CONCLUSIONS: The AVM hemorrhage rate seems to reduce after GKS. After radiosurgery, none of the patients or nidus-related risk factors remained relevant to the occurrence of hemorrhage. The nidus treated with a high radiosurgical dose is less likely to bleed.",2011 Jun,2011,Stroke,42,6,1691-6,eng,False,10.1161/STROKEAHA.110.602706;STROKEAHA.110.602706;10.1161/STROKEAHA.110.602706,Journal Article,Adult;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/pathology/*surgery;Intracranial Hemorrhages/*etiology;Male;Middle Aged;Postoperative Complications/*etiology;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects;Risk Factors;Treatment Outcome,
39283113,Comparison of Repeat Versus Initial Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations: A Retrospective Multicenter Matched Cohort Study.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Studies comparing neurological and radiographic outcomes of repeat to initial stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) intracranial arteriovenous malformations are scarce. Our aim was to perform a retrospective matched comparison of patients initially treated with SRS with those undergoing a second radiosurgical procedure. METHODS: We collected data from arteriovenous malformations managed in 21 centers that underwent initial and repeated radiosurgery from 1987 to 2022. Based on arteriovenous malformations volume, margin dose, deep venous drainage, deep, and critical location, we matched 1:1 patients who underwent an initial SRS for treatment-naive arteriovenous malformations and a group with repeated SRS treatment. RESULTS: After the selection process, our sample consisted of 328 patients in each group. Obliteration in the initial SRs group was 35.8% at 3 and 56.7% at 5 years post-SRS, while the repeat SRS group showed obliteration rates of 33.9% at 3 years and 58.6% at 5 years, without statistically significant differences (P = .75 and P = .88, respectively). There were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups for obliteration rates (hazard ratio = 0.93; 95% CI, 0.77-1.13; P = .5), overall radiation-induced changes (RIC) (OR = 1.1; 95% CI, 0.75-1.6; P = .6), symptomatic RIC (OR = 0.78; 95% CI, 0.4-1.5; P = .4), and post-SRS hemorrhage (OR = 0.68; 95% CI; P = .3).

36262095,Brain arteriovenous malformation flow after stereotactic radiosurgery: Role of quantitative MRA.,"BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a current therapeutic option for treatment of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) located in deep or eloquent brain regions. Obliteration usually occurs in a delayed fashion, with an expected latency of 3-5 years. Here, we assess how AVM flow correlates with volume before and after SRS treatment. METHODS: Patients with supratentorial AVM treated with SRS at our institution between 2012-2022 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were included if Quantitative Magnetic Resonance Angiography (QMRA) study was performed at baseline and at least at the first follow-up. Correlation between AVM flow and volume before and after treatment was evaluated. AVM flow and volume were additionally assessed for obliteration using the non-parametric receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS: Twelve patients with radiologic follow-up imaging were included. Eight patients presented AVM rupture, one of which occurred after radiosurgical treatment. Three patients underwent embolization prior SRS. Mean AVM initial volume was 3.8 cc (0.1-12.4 cc), mean initial flow 174 ml/min (11-604 ml/min), both variables showed progressive reduction at follow-up (range 3-57 months); and flow decreased with volume reduction (p < 0.001). Area under the ROC was 0.914 for both AVM flow and volume with obliteration (p = 0.019). CONCLUSIONS: AVM flow significantly decreased after SRS treatment, reflecting volume reduction. Baseline AVM flow and volume both predicted obliteration. QMRA provides additional non-invasive information to monitor patients after radiosurgical treatment.",2024 Apr,2024,"Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology,",30,2,242-249,eng,False,10.1177/15910199221133174;10.1177_15910199221133174;10.1177/15910199221133174,Journal Article,Humans;*Radiosurgery/methods;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/surgery/radiotherapy;Female;Male;Retrospective Studies;*Magnetic Resonance Angiography;Adult;Middle Aged;Treatment Outcome;Aged;Adolescent;Cerebrovascular Circulation,Brain AVM;SRS;flow;volume
16670050,Embolization of arteriovenous fistula after radiosurgery for multiple cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"Cerebral arteriovenous malformation (CAVM) associated with arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is rare. It may be difficult to identify hemodynamic details of mixed CAVM and AVF, even when using x-ray cerebral angiography (digital subtraction angiography). We report on a 37-year-old male patient with headache that led to an initial diagnosis of deep frontotemporal CAVM. The first DSA revealed engorged, tortuous, and high-flow venous drainage in addition to clusters of vasculature niduses. The patient was initially treated using gamma-knife radiosurgery (GKRS), which resulted in partial nidus obliteration, documented by a series of follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, the high-flow venous drainage remained, seen on MRI as engorged venous pouches. Clinically, the patient was bothered by persistent headache and bruits after GKRS. Follow-up DSA 3 years after GKRS confirmed a small remnant CAVM nidus and a nearby AVF, separated from and lateral to the original CAVM nidus in the ipsilateral deep temporal lobe. When the initial DSA was reviewed, it revealed that the AVF was difficult to define because of superimposition of the nidus and engorged drainage vessels. Embolization of the AVF using electrodetachable coils resulted in total occlusion of the AVF. The patient's symptoms resolved immediately after embolization. This case suggests that superselective angiography using a microcatheter may be necessary for the initial diagnosis of CAVM associated with AVF with high-flow and engorged venous drainage. For CAVM patients with persistent symptoms after radiosurgery and engorged venous drainage when CAVM is expected to be cured, a microcatheter and superselective endovascular approach may offer diagnosis. Immediate embolization for associated AVF in the same angiographic session may thereby improve neurologic deficits and reduce hemorrhagic risk during the latency after GKRS.",2005 Dec,2005,The Kaohsiung journal of medical sciences,21,12,571-7,eng,False,S1607-551X(09)70210-4;10.1016/S1607-551X(09)70210-4,"Case Reports;Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adult;Arteriovenous Fistula/*therapy;*Embolization, Therapeutic;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;*Radiosurgery",
16021387,Intensity-modulated radiosurgery for childhood arteriovenous malformations.,"PURPOSE: Presentation of intensity-modulated radiosurgery (IMRS) for the treatment of inoperable, complex shaped pediatric arterio-venous malformations AVM. METHOD: Between 03/99 and 11/04, IMRS was delivered to seven children aged six to 18 years. Prescribed minimum doses ranged from 17.5 to 20 Gy (median 18 Gy). Radiosurgery planning and delivery used a serial tomotherapeutic IMRT technique (Peacock IMRT, North American Scientific/Nomos, Cranberry Township, PA) over two to four couch angles. A linear accelerator attached binary multi-leaf collimator was used to generate pencil beams of 10 mm by either 8.5 or 4.0 mm. Treatment planning employed an inverse treatment planning optimization algorithm. Parameters submitted to the treatment planning system were: prescription dose (PD), volume of target allowed to receive less dose (standard 3%), minimum dose (0.5 Gy less than PD), and maximum dose (200% of PD). Planning system specific IMRS target and tissue types were selected to prioritize dose conformality over dose homogeneity. The prescription isodose encompassed at least 95% of the target volume. We calculated conformality (CI) and homogeneity indices (HI) to characterize the quality of IMRS plans, and summarized preliminary clinical outcomes. FINDINGS: Target volumes ranged from 0.71 to 63.02 cm(3) (median 13.8 cm(3), 6/7 AVM larger than 10 cm(3)). Median CI was 1.07 (range 1.05 to 1.7) according to RTOG criteria. Median HI was 1.12 (range 1.09 to 1.23). During limited follow-up (median 32 months, range 5 to 53 months), two AVM completely obliterated at 19 and 22 months, and partial obliteration (>75%) was observed in three cases. No treatment-related side effects, other than acute nausea and temporary headaches interpreted as being associated with changes in cerebral blood distribution, were observed. CONCLUSIONS: IMRS can allow for highly conformal planning and delivery of radiosurgery radiation doses even if pediatric AVM target volumes are large and/or highly complex in shape. This technique has been seen to result in favorable preliminary outcomes, thus supporting future exploration of this technique in pediatric and adult patients.",2005 Nov,2005,Acta neurochirurgica,147,11,1141-9; discussion 1149-50,eng,False,10.1007/s00701-005-0572-9,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Age Factors;Algorithms;Brain/growth & development/radiation effects;Cerebral Angiography;Cerebral Arteries/pathology/physiopathology/*surgery;Child;Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/physiopathology/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Postoperative Complications/prevention & control;Preoperative Care;Radiation Dosage;Radiosurgery/adverse effects/instrumentation/*methods;Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated/adverse effects/instrumentation/*methods;Secondary Prevention;Treatment Outcome",

We performed a retrospective review between 1 January 1999 and 31 December 2017 for ruptured bAVM in a regional neurosurgical centre in Hong Kong. All other vascular pathologies and unruptured cases were excluded. Thirty-three eligible patients were included for analysis. The median age at presentation was 12 (3-18), with a slight male preponderance. Presenting complaints included headache (60.6%), motor deficits (24.2%), and seizure (6.1%). Glasgow coma scale (GCS) on presentation (median, IQR) was 15 (13-15). bAVMs were lobar in 57.6%, infratentorial in 27.3%, and basal ganglia in 9.1%. Follow-up was 101 ± 61 months and ranged from 24 to 229 months. 12 (36.4%) patients underwent emergency haematoma evacuation with or without bAVM excision because of neurological deterioration in the acute phase. 7 (21.2%) patients underwent interval excision and 11(33.3%) patients underwent stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). There was no residual bAVM and no Clavien-Dindo complications greater than grade II in interval surgery group. Those who underwent SRS had a significantly higher Spetzler-Martin grade; bAVM obliteration was achieved at 73.3%, without any major symptomatic post-radiosurgery complications. There was 1 (3%) mortality and 30 (90.9%) patients recovered well with minor non-disabling deficits (GOS 5).

24180569,Durable thrombosis in a rat model of arteriovenous malformation treated with radiosurgery and vascular targeting.,"OBJECT: Radiosurgical treatment of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) has the significant shortcomings of being limited to lesions smaller than 3 cm in diameter and of a latency-to-cure time of up to 3 years. A possible method of overcoming these limitations is stimulation of thrombosis by using vascular targeting. Using an animal model of AVM, the authors examined the durability of the thrombosis induced by the vascular-targeting agents lipopolysaccharide and soluble tissue factor conjugate (LPS/sTF). METHODS: Stereotactic radiosurgery or sham radiation was administered to 32 male Sprague-Dawley rats serving as an animal model of AVM; 24 hours after this intervention, the rats received an intravenous injection of LPS/sTF or normal saline. The animals were killed at 1, 7, 30, or 90 days after treatment. Immediately beforehand, angiography was performed, and model AVM tissue was harvested for histological analysis to assess rates of vessel thrombosis. RESULTS: Among rats that received radiosurgery and LPS/sTF, induced thrombosis occurred in 58% of small AVM vessels; among those that received radiosurgery and saline, thrombosis occurred in 12% of small AVM vessels (diameter < 200 μm); and among those that received LPS/sTF but no radiosurgery, thrombosis occurred at an intermediate rate of 43%. No systemic toxicity or intravascular thrombosis remote from the target region was detected in any of the animals. CONCLUSIONS: Vascular targeting can increase intravascular thrombosis after radiosurgery, and the vessel occlusion is durable. Further work is needed to refine this approach to AVM treatment, which shows promise as a way to overcome the limitations of radiosurgery.",2014 Jan,2014,Journal of neurosurgery,120,1,113-9,eng,False,10.3171/2013.9.JNS122056;10.3171/2013.9.JNS122056,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Animals;Cerebral Angiography;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Male;Models, Animal;Radiosurgery/*methods;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Thrombosis/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Treatment Outcome",
30071340,Effect of Advanced Age on Stereotactic Radiosurgery Outcomes for Brain Arteriovenous Malformations: A Multicenter Matched Cohort Study.,"BACKGROUND: The effect of age on adult brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM) outcomes after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) remains unclear. The aim of this study is to compare AVM outcomes between elderly (age ≥60 years) and nonelderly adult patients. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed pooled data comprising patients who underwent SRS for AVMs between 1987 and 2014 at 8 centers participating in the International Gamma Knife Research Foundation. Adult (age ≥18 years) patients with ≥12 months follow-up were dichotomized into elderly and nonelderly cohorts, and matched in a 1:1 ratio. Favorable outcome was AVM obliteration without permanent symptomatic radiation-induced changes (RIC) or post-SRS hemorrhage. RESULTS: The study cohort consisted of 1845 patients (188 elderly vs. 1657 nonelderly) who met the inclusion criteria, and subsequent matching resulted in 181 patients in each cohort. In the matched cohorts, rates of obliteration (54.7% vs. 64.6%; P = 0.054) favorable outcome (51.4% vs. 61.3%; P = 0.056) were no different between the elderly and nonelderly cohorts. The rates of post-SRS hemorrhage (9.9% vs. 5.5%; P = 0.115), RIC (26.5% vs. 30.9%; P = 0.353), symptomatic RIC (9.4% vs. 9.4%; P = 1.000), and permanent symptomatic RIC (3.3% vs. 2.2%; P = 0.750) were also not significantly different between the elderly and nonelderly cohorts. Elderly patients with AVM did have a significantly higher rate of all-cause mortality (27.7% vs. 5.5%; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Advanced age does not seem to significantly affect obliteration or complication rates after SRS for AVMs. Although the decision to recommend intervention for AVMs in the elderly population is multifactorial, SRS may be a viable modality when treatment is deemed appropriate.",2018 Nov,2018,World neurosurgery,119,,e429-e440,eng,True,S1878-8750(18)31656-5;10.1016/j.wneu.2018.07.178;S1878-8750(18)31656-5;10.1016/j.wneu.2018.07.178,Journal Article;Multicenter Study,"Adult;Age Factors;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/epidemiology/*radiotherapy;Male;Middle Aged;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome",Age;Arteriovenous malformation;Cerebrovascular;Gamma Knife;Old;Radiosurgery
25050575,Results for a series of 697 arteriovenous malformations treated by gamma knife: influence of angiographic features on the obliteration rate.,"BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiosurgery (RS) is an effective tool in treating brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Careful study of AVM angiographic characteristics may improve results. OBJECTIVE: To report the long-term outcomes of Gamma Knife RS (GKRS) in brain AVMs, focusing on how the angioarchitectural and hemodynamic parameters of AVMs affect the post-RS results. METHODS: This was a retrospective, longitudinal study of 697 consecutive GKRS treatments of brain AVMs in 662 patients performed at a single center between 1993 and 2005. The mean age of the patients was 37 years; the median AVM volume was 3.6 cm(3); and the mean follow-up was 11 years. Forty-five percent of patients presented with intracranial hemorrhage; 44% underwent embolization; and 7% had multiple RSs. AVM characteristics in the RS-planning angiograms were analyzed, and their relationship to the post-RS obliteration rate was determined by univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: The obliteration rate after a single RS was 69.3%; after multiple RS, it was 75%. Positive predictors of obliteration included compact nidus (odds ratio = 3.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.92-5.22), undilated feeders (odds ratio = 0.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.23-0.57), smaller AVM volume (odds ratio = 0.95; 95% confidence interval, 0.92-0.99), and higher marginal dose (odds ratio = 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.27). Improvement or clinical stability was observed in 89.3% of patients; postprocedural bleeding was noted in 6.1%; and clinical worsening attributable to RS was seen in 3.8%. The annual risk of hemorrhage in the 4 years after RS was 1.2%. CONCLUSION: GKRS yielded a good long-term clinical outcome in most patients. Certain angiographic features of brain AVMs such as a well-defined nidus and undilated feeder arteries contribute to AVM occlusion by RS. GKRS can be regarded as the treatment of choice for AVMs <6 cm(3), even after bleeding.",2014 Nov,2014,Neurosurgery,75,5,568-83; dicussion 582-3; quiz 583,eng,True,10.1227/NEU.0000000000000506;10.1227/NEU.0000000000000506,Journal Article,Adult;Aged;Cerebral Angiography;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Hemodynamics;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Longitudinal Studies;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/*methods;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome,
37235978,Quantitative Analysis of Parenchymal Effects and Flow of Large Arteriovenous Malformations Managed With Stereotactic Radiosurgery.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) of larger arteriovenous malformations (AVM) is associated with an elevated incidence of adverse radiation effects (ARE). To date, volume-response and dose-response models have been used to predict such effects. To understand radiological outcomes and their hemodynamic effects on the regional brain. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted at our institution using a prospective registry of patients managed between 2014 and 2020. We included patients with AVM with a nidus larger than 5 cc who received either single-session or volume-staged Gamma Knife radiosurgery. AVM volume changes, volumes of parenchymal response, and obliteration were analyzed and correlated with transit times and diameters of feeding arteries and draining veins. RESULTS: Sixteen patients underwent single-session SRS, and 9 patients underwent volume-staged SRS. The average AVM volume was 12.6 cc (5.5-23). The AVM locations were predominantly lobar (80%) and 17 (68%) were in critical locations. The mean margin dose was 17.2 Gy (15-21), and the median V12Gy was 25.5 cc. Fourteen (56%) AVMs had a transit time shorter than 1 second. The median vein-artery ratio (sum diameter of the veins/sum diameter of feeding arteries) was 1.63 (range, 0.60-4.19). Asymptomatic parenchymal effects were detected in 13 (52%) patients and were symptomatic in 4 (16%) patients. The median time to ARE was 12 months (95% CI 7.6-16.4). On univariate analysis, significant predictors of ARE were lower vein-artery ratio ( P = .024), longer transit time ( P = .05), higher mean dose ( P = .028), and higher D95 ( P = .036). CONCLUSION: Transit times and vessel diameters are valuable predictors of the subsequent parenchymal response after SRS. A more quantitative understanding of blood flow is critical for predicting the effects on the regional brain after AVM radiosurgery.",2023 Nov 1,2023,Neurosurgery,93,5,1057-1065,eng,False,10.1227/neu.0000000000002539;00006123-990000000-00749;10.1227/neu.0000000000002539,Journal Article,Humans;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects;Treatment Outcome;Retrospective Studies;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/radiotherapy/surgery;Brain/surgery;Follow-Up Studies,

We aimed to present clinical presentation, angiographic features and treatment strategies of TM-AVMs through a single center retrospective case series. METHODS: A TM-AVMs is defined as a nidus located in the parenchyma or on the pia mater of the posterior midbrain. Records of consecutive patients admitted with TM-AVMs over a 21-year period were retrospectively analyzed. Vascular anatomy of the region is also reviewed. RESULTS: In this study 13 patients (1.63% of the complete cohort; 10 males), mean age 48 years, were included. All patients presented with intracranial hemorrhage and two patients (15%) died after an early recurrent bleeding. Mean size of the TM-AVMs was 10.1 ± 5 mm. Multiple arterial feeders were noted in every cases. Of the patients 11 underwent an exclusion treatment, 8 via embolization (6 via arterial access and 2 via venous access) and 4 via stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) (1 patient received both). Overall success treatment rate was 7/11 patients (64% overall; 63% in the embolization group, 25% in the SRS group). Two hemorrhagic events led to a worsened outcome, one during embolization and one several years after SRS. All other patients remained clinically stable or improved. CONCLUSION: The TM-AVMs are rare but stereotypic lesions found in a hemorrhagic context. Multiple arterial feeders are always present.

37060846,Unruptured cerebral arteriovenous malformation in children: Outcome in treated and untreated patients.,"BACKGROUND: The management of unruptured cerebral arteriovenous malformation (URCAVM) is highly controversial; however, data regarding URCAVM in children are scarce. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed consecutive children followed for URCAVM in our department between 2001 and 2021. RESULTS: Out of 36 patients, 12 were initially managed by observation, and 24 underwent first-line treatment: 8 by microsurgery, 10 by radiosurgery, 2 by embolization, and 4 by combined treatment. Mean follow-up of the whole group was 63months. Complete cure of the malformation was obtained in 14 patients (58%) in the treatment group: 8/8 in the microsurgery group, 5/10 in the radiosurgery group, 1/4 in the combined treatment group, and none in the embolization group. Two of the initially non-treated patients presented cerebral hemorrhage, with significant neurological consequences. In the treatment group, 5 patients presented new neurological deficits, only 1 of which, however, was functionally significant. Headache improved in 11 cases, mostly in the treatment group. Overall, 6 patients in the treatment group became asymptomatic, versus none in the observation group. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment of URCAVM is a reasonable option in many pediatric cases, considering the cumulative risk of cerebral hemorrhage during the child's lifetime, as well as the symptoms specific to URCAVM.

Little is known about vessel morphology and optimum treatment modalities including multimodality combination therapy and prognosis in children. METHODS: A retrospective review of all children presenting to our institution from 2006 to 2020 that had an AVM was undertaken. RESULTS: A total of 50 children were identified with median age of 11 (range 1-16) years. The mean follow-up was 7.6 years. Forty-one children presented as an emergency and of those, 40 had hemorrhage identified on initial brain imaging.

The supplemental Spetzler-Martin grading indicated 78% (39/50) were grade 4 and above (moderate to high risk). Primary treatment modalities included embolization in 50% (25) or SRS in 30% (15) and surgery in 20% (10).The AVM was obliterated on follow-up DSA in 66% children. Three children had post-treatment hemorrhage, two related to embolization and one the day following SRS, giving a re-bleed rate of 6%. The GOSE was available for 32 children at long term follow and 94% had a good outcome (GOSE 5-8). Two children died due to acute hemorrhage (4%).

We used the Florida Cancer Data System (FCDS) to determine the actual cancer rates for SRS-treated patients, and we compared these to the cancer rates in similar groups of non-SRS-treated patients based on rates available from the SEER (surveillance epidemiology and end results) database. RESULTS: A total of 2,369 patients were analyzed. Of these, 862 were patients with metastases who were analyzed only to ensure the sensitivity of using the FCDS to determine malignancy rates. The results for patients with more than 5 years of follow-up are reported. Without the metastases patients, a total of 627 patients had more than 5 years of follow-up data. Follow-up in patient-years was 1,711 for the meningioma patients, 1,851 for the schwannoma patients, 1,407 for the AVM patients and 338 for patients with a diagnosis of 'other'. The observed cancer rate in the meningioma patients was 3.96% compared to the expected rate of 10% (binomial 95% confidence interval, CI = 1.85-7.94). The observed cancer rate in the schwannoma patients was 4.93% compared to the expected rate of 12.5% (95% CI = 2.61-8.89). The observed cancer rate in the AVM patients was 3.64% compared to the expected rate of 4.43% (95% CI = 1.49-8.10). The observed cancer rate in patients treated for other diagnoses (e.g. pituitary adenoma or trigeminal neuralgia) was 0% compared to the expected rate of 6.36% (95% CI = 0-11.7).

18607130,The rare association of moyamoya disease and cerebral arteriovenous malformations: a case report.,"A 36-year-old man was diagnosed with a right temporal lobe grade II cerebral arteriovenous malformation (cAVM) and was treated with radiosurgery. At nine months after the cAVM radiosurgery, the patient began to develop bilateral focal narrowing at the M1 segments of the bilateral middle cerebral arteries. The narrowing progressively deteriorated as was demonstrated on longitudinal serial follow-up MR imaging. X-ray angiography performed at 51 months after radiosurgery confirmed that the cAVM was cured and a diagnosis of moyamoya disease. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of cAVM-associated moyamoya disease that developed after radiosurgery. Given the chronological sequence of disease development and radiation dose distribution of radiosurgery, it is proposed that humoral or unknown predisposing factors, rather than direct radiation effects, are the cause of moyamoya disease associated with cAVM.",2008 Jul,2008,Korean journal of radiology,9 Suppl,Suppl,S65-7,eng,False,10.3348/kjr.2008.9.s.s65;200807s065;10.3348/kjr.2008.9.s.s65,Case Reports;Journal Article,Adult;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Moyamoya Disease/*etiology;Postoperative Complications;Radiosurgery,
29908698,Delayed hemorrhagic complication after complete embolization of a brain arteriovenous malformation.,"Endovascular embolization is an essential therapeutic approach in the multidisciplinary management of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM). However, it rarely occludes the AVM in its entirety. It is often combined with surgery or stereotactic radiosurgery. The aim of embolization is to reduce the size of the nidus and the intra-nidal flow in order to facilitate the microsurgical or the radiosurgical procedure. We report the case of a 61-year-old patient with a right frontal hemorrhagic AVM treated with complete embolization in a single session. Initially, a surgical procedure for excision of the AVM was scheduled 24hours post-embolization. This surgery was canceled due to a good angiographic result of the embolization. Eight days post-embolization, there was a massive re-bleed of the AVM which justified emergency surgical management. This case illustrates a delayed post-embolization hemorrhagic complication of an occluded AVM and prompts a review of the therapeutic strategy of the cerebral AVM to select the most effective and least morbid procedure or combination of procedures.",2018 Sep,2018,Neuro-Chirurgie,64,4,316-320,eng,False,S0028-3770(18)30049-3;10.1016/j.neuchi.2018.04.005;S0028-3770(18)30049-3;10.1016/j.neuchi.2018.04.005,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Brain/blood supply/*surgery;*Embolization, Therapeutic/methods;Hemorrhage/diagnosis/*etiology/surgery;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/diagnosis/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/methods;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome",Arteriovenous malformation;Embolization;Intracerebral hemorrhage;Microsurgery
22791027,Retrospective analysis of imaging techniques for treatment planning and monitoring of obliteration for gamma knife treatment of cerebral arteriovenous malformation.,"BACKGROUND: It has been well established that Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKS) is an effective treatment for brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate complete obliteration rates for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based GKS treatment planning performed with and without angiography and to conduct a preliminary assessment of the utility of using pulsed arterial spin labeling (PASL) magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion imaging to confirm complete obliteration. METHODS: Forty-six patients were identified who had undergone GKS without embolization with a minimum follow-up of 2 years. One group was planned with integrated stereotactic angiography and MR (spoiled gradient recalled) images obtained on the day of GKS. A second technique avoided the risk of arteriography by using only axial MR images. Beginning in 2007, PASL MR perfusion imaging was routinely performed as a portion of the follow-up MRI to assess the restoration of normal blood flow of the nidus and surrounding area. RESULTS: The overall obliteration rate for the angiography/MRI group was 88.0% (29 of 33). Patients in the MRI-only group had an obliteration rate of 61.5% (8 of 13), with P=.092 with the Fisher exact test, which is not statistically significant. A Kaplan-Meier analysis was also not statistically significant (log rank test, P=.474). Four of 9 patients with incomplete obliteration on angiography also had shown residual abnormal blood flow on PASL imaging. CONCLUSION: This retrospective analysis shows that treatment planning technique used in GKS does not play a role in the eventual obliteration of treated AVMs. PASL may have potential in the evaluation of AVM obliteration.",2012 Oct,2012,Neurosurgery,71,4,893-9,eng,False,10.1227/NEU.0b013e3182672a83,Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Arterial Pressure;Cerebral Angiography;Child;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Kaplan-Meier Estimate;*Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/*methods;Retrospective Studies;Spin Labels;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult,

18630762,"Arteriovenous malformation, complications, and perioperative anesthetic management.","Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are the most common intracranial vascular malformation, with an estimated occurrence of 1:5000-1:2000 persons. The repair requires careful embolization, often followed by stereotactic radiosurgery and can also include open craniotomy. Preoperatively, patients may be healthy or dramatically unstable, as 30-50% of these cases present with acute cerebral hemorrhage. One of the most important considerations for the anesthesiologist should be attempting to achieve hemodynamic stability in the face of potential increased intracranial pressure and subsequent vulnerability of the tissues to ischemic insult. Knowledge of the risks and hazards of the procedure and collaboration with specialists, including neuroradiologists, critical care physicians, and potentially neurosurgeons, ultimately form the basis for appropriate management. AVM's can lead to potentially fatal ischemic or hemorrhagic complications that may occur in up to 8% of cases. The protection of the airway, adequate monitoring, and maintaining cardiovascular and neurological stability, are critical.

25175434,Stereotactic radiosurgery of intracranial arteriovenous malformations and the use of the K index in determining treatment dose.,"OBJECT: The appropriate dose during stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) remains a matter of debate. In the present study, the authors retrospectively evaluated the association of using a prescribed dose calculated utilizing the K index with the obliteration rate of cerebral AVMs after SRS. METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective analysis of the Cleveland Clinic SRS database. All patients undergoing Gamma Knife radiosurgery for cerebral AVMs from 1997 to 2010 were selected. Regression techniques and Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to investigate the effect of divergence from the optimal K index dose on the rate of AVM obliteration. RESULTS: In the study period 152 patients (mean age 43.6 years; 53.9% of treatments were performed in females) underwent 165 Gamma Knife radiosurgery treatments for AVMs. In a univariate analysis Spetzler-Martin grade (OR 0.63 [95% CI 0.42-0.93]), higher AVM score (OR 0.43 [95% CI 0.27-0.70]), larger AVM volume (OR 0.88 [95% CI 0.82-0.94]), and higher maximum diameter (OR 0.56 [95% CI 0.41-0.77]) were associated with a lower rate of AVM obliteration. Higher margin dose (OR 1.16 [95% CI 1.08-1.24]) and higher maximum dose (OR 1.08 [95% CI 1.04-1.13]) were associated with a higher obliteration rate. To further examine the effect of prescribed dose divergence from the calculated K index dose, cases were classified to groups depending on the AVM volume and dose variance from the ideal K index dose. Contingency tables and Kaplan-Meier curves were then created, and no significant differences in rates of obliteration were noted among the different groups.

36219806,Risk for Hemorrhage the First 2 Years After Gamma Knife Surgery for Arteriovenous Malformations: An Update.,"BACKGROUND: Knowledge about the natural course of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) have increased during the past 20 years, as has the number of AVMs treated, especially larger ones. It is thus timely to again analyze the risk for hemorrhage after Gamma Knife Surgery (GKS). OBJECTIVE: To confirm or contradict conclusions drawn 20 years ago regarding factors that affect the risk for post-GKS hemorrhage. METHODS: The outcome after GKS was studied in 5037 AVM patients followed for up to 2 years. The relation between post-treatment hemorrhage rate and a number of patient, AVM, and treatment parameters was analyzed. The results were also compared with the results from our earlier study. RESULTS: The annual post-treatment hemorrhage rate was 2.4% the first 2 years after GKS. Large size, low treatment dose, and old age were independent risk factors for AVM hemorrhage. After having compensated for the factors above, peripheral AVM location and female sex, at least during their child bearing ages, were factors associated with a lower post-GKS hemorrhage rate. CONCLUSION: Large AVMs (>5 cm 3 ) treated with low doses (≤16 Gy) had higher and small AVMs treated with high doses a lower risk for hemorrhage as compared with untreated AVMs. This was detectable within the first 6 months after GKS. No difference in hemorrhage rate could be detected for the other AVMs. Based on our findings, it is advisable to prescribe >16 Gy to larger AVMs, assuming that the risk for radiation-induced complications can be kept at an acceptable level.",2022 Dec 1,2022,Neurosurgery,91,6,920-927,eng,False,10.1227/neu.0000000000002130;00006123-202212000-00013;NEU-D-21-01619;10.1227/neu.0000000000002130,Journal Article,Humans;Female;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications;Treatment Outcome;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects/methods;Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology/complications;Risk Factors;*Radiation Injuries/etiology;Retrospective Studies;Follow-Up Studies,
25549943,Stereotactic radiosurgery for pediatric patients with intracranial arteriovenous malformations: variables that may affect obliteration time and probability.,"INTRODUCTION: It is debatable whether pediatric patients diagnosed with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) should be treated as adults. Several indexes to classify AVMs have been proposed in the literature, and most try to predict the outcome for each specific treatment. The indexes differ in the variables considered, but they are all based in adult populations. In this study, we analyzed the variables that influence the obliteration time and probability of occurrence in a Mexican pediatric population diagnosed with an AVM and treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). METHODS: We analyzed 45 pediatric patients (<18 years) with a minimum follow-up of 10 months and a maximum of 112 months. We used logistic regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier curves to evaluate the influence of age, AVM volume, prescribed dose, minimum dose, maximum dose, time of follow-up, sex, previous hemorrhage, venous drainage, treatment technique, previous treatment and location. We also evaluated the predictive power of the following indexes: Spetzler-Martin, RBAS, or K index dose deviation. RESULTS: We found that the radiation technique used may influence the obliteration occurrence (p=0.057). The data suggests that circular arcs are a more efficient treatment technique than dynamic arcs. However, no relationship of dose or volume with treatment technique could be found. Obliteration was also dependent on follow-up time and after three years of follow-up, the obliteration probability decreases (p=0.024). According to Kaplan-Meier analysis, the nidus obliteration time was related with the location according to the Spetzler-Martin index. If the nidus was located in a non-eloquent region, there was a tendency of a shorter obliteration time (p=0.071). CONCLUSION: None of the previously proposed indexes for adults predict obliteration in this pediatric population. Treatment technique, eloquence and follow up time were the only variables that showed influence in obliteration. Since the highest probability of obliteration occurs during the first three years, if the nidus has not been obliterated after this time then another treatment option could be considered.",2015 Feb,2015,Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,129,,62-6,eng,False,S0303-8467(14)00462-4;10.1016/j.clineuro.2014.11.019;S0303-8467(14)00462-4;10.1016/j.clineuro.2014.11.019,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adolescent;Cerebral Angiography/methods;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/*mortality/*surgery;Male;Probability;*Radiosurgery/methods;Time Factors;Treatment Outcome",Arteriovenous malformations;K-index;Obliteration probability;Pediatric stereotactic radiosurgery;RBAS

23420116,Evaluation of prognostic factors as predictor of AVMS obliteration after Gamma Knife radiosurgery.,"BACKGROUND: The reported AVMs obliteration rate after Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKS) ranges from 70 to 94 %. The objective of the present study was to assess prognostic factors predictive for cerebral AVMs obliteration in 127 patients who underwent GKS. METHODS: The AVMs were classified according to the Spetzler-Martin classification. Twenty-one cases (16.5 %) were classified as grade I, 46 cases (36.2 %) as grade II, 51 cases (40.1 %) as grade III, and nine cases (7.1 %) as grade IV-V. The AVMs were deeply located in 16.5 % of patients. The peripheral prescription dose ranged from 16 to 30 Gy (mean 22.3 Gy). The AVMs volume ranged from 0.1 to 13 cc (mean 2.7 cc). RESULTS: In 72 patients out of the 104 (69.2 %) with a radiological follow-up, MRI showed the AVM obliteration; in 54 cases (60 %) out of the 90 that performed a DSA, a complete AVM obliteration was achieved (average closure time 48.5 months). The volume of the nidus (p = 0.001), the prescription dose (p = 0.004), the 2002 Pollock-Flickinger classification (p = 0.031), and their 2008 revised classification (p = 0.025) were found to be statistically significant in predicting the probability of AVM closure. In the multivariate analysis, only the prescription dose was found to be an independent prognostic factor (p = 0.009) for AVM obliteration. CONCLUSIONS: The volume of the nidus and the prescription dose significantly influence the outcome of radiosurgical treatment. The Pollock-Flickinger classification was found to be a reliable scoring system in predicting the AVM closure and an important tool for selection of patients candidate for GKS.",2013 Apr,2013,Acta neurochirurgica,155,4,619-26,eng,True,10.1007/s00701-013-1631-2;10.1007/s00701-013-1631-2,Journal Article,Adult;Cerebral Angiography/methods;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/classification/*diagnosis/diagnostic;Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods;Male;Middle Aged;*Predictive Value of Tests;Prognosis;Radiosurgery/*methods,
12650425,Three-dimensional angiography for radiosurgical treatment planning for arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECT: Radiosurgical treatment of a cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) requires the precise definition of the nidus of the lesion in stereotactic space. This cannot be accomplished using simple stereotactic angiography. but requires a combination of stereotactic biplanar angiographic images and stereotactic contrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CT) scans. In the present study the authors describe a method in which three-dimensional (3D) rotational angiography is integrated into stereotactic space to aid treatment planning for radiosurgery. METHODS: Twenty patients harboring AVMs underwent treatment planning prior to linear accelerator radiosurgery. Planning involved the acquisition of two different data sets, one of which was obtained using the standard method (a combination of biplanar stereotactic angiography with stereotactic CT scanning), and the other, which was procured using a new technique (nonstereotactic 3D rotational angiography combined with stereotactic CT scanning by a procedure of image fusion). The treatment plan that was developed using the new method was compared with that developed using the standard one. For each patient the number of isocenters and the dimension of selected collimators were the same, based on the information supplied in both methods. Target coordinates were modified in only five cases and by a limited amount (mean 0.7 mm, range 0.3-1 mm). CONCLUSIONS: The new imaging modality offers an easier and more immediate interpretation of 3D data, while maintaining the same accuracy in target definition as that provided by the standard technique. Moreover, the new method has the advantage of using nonstereotactic 3D angiography, which can be performed at a different site and a different time with respect to the irradiation procedure.",2003 Mar,2003,Journal of neurosurgery,98,3,536-43,eng,False,10.3171/jns.2003.98.3.0536,Comparative Study;Evaluation Study;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Cerebral Angiography/*standards;Child;Female;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional/*standards;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;*Patient Care Planning;*Radiosurgery;Stereotaxic Techniques",

The goal of this study was to increase knowledge in this area by reporting the authors' experience. METHODS: The authors describe an institutional review board-approved retrospective study in which they examined databases including information on 250 patients who consecutively underwent GKS for cerebral AVMs during a 16-year period (1988-2004). Among the 250 patients the authors identified 31 patients (12.4%, 15 female and 16 male patients with a mean age of 29 years [range 10-63 years]) in whom 2-stage GKS was intentionally planned at the time of initial treatment because the volume of the AVM nidus was larger than 10 cm(3). The most common presentation was bleeding (14 patients), followed by seizures (9 patients), incidental findings (7 patients), and headache with scintillation (1 patient). One patient underwent GKS for the treatment of 2 AVMs simultaneously, and thus 32 AVMs are included in this study. The mean nidus volume was 16.2 cm(3) (maximum 55.8 cm(3)). In all 31 patients, relatively low radiation doses (12-16 Gy directed at the periphery of the lesion) were intentionally used for the first GKS. The second GKS was scheduled for at least 36 months after the first. RESULTS: Complete nidus obliteration was obtained after the first GKS in 1 patient. To date, 26 patients have undergone a second procedure with a post-GKS mean interval of 41 months (range 24-83 months); 2 other patients refused to undergo the second GKS, and no further treatment was given because of severe morbidity in 1 case and death due to bleeding in the other case. Among the 26 patients who did undergo a second procedure, 3 patients refused follow-up digital subtraction (DS) angiography, another is scheduled for follow-up DS angiography, and 2 patients died, one of bleeding and the other of an unknown cause. The remaining 20 patients underwent follow-up DS angiography. Complete nidus obliteration was confirmed in 13 patients (65.0%) and remarkable nidus shrinkage in the other 7 patients (35.0%). In 2 of these 7 patients, a third GKS achieved complete nidus obliteration. Therefore, the cumulative complete obliteration rate in this series was 76.2% (16 of 21 eligible patients). Seven patients (22.6%) experienced bleeding. The bleeding rates were 9.7%, 16.1%, 16.1%, and 26.1%, respectively, at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years post-GKS. There were 2 deaths and 3 cases of morbidity (persistent coma, mild hemimotor weakness, and hemianopsia in 1 patient each). Hemorrhage did not produce neurological deficits in the other 2 patients. During the mean post-GKS follow-up period of 105 months (range 42-229 months) to date, mild symptomatic GKS-related complications occurred in 2 patients (6.5%); these were classified as Radiation Oncology Group Neurotoxicity Grade 1 in 1 patient and Grade 2 in the other. Among various pre-GKS clinical factors, univariate analysis showed only patient age to impact complications (hazard ratio 0.675, 95% CI 0.306-0.942, p = 0.0085). The rate of complications in the pediatric cases was 33.3%, whereas that in the adolescent and adult cases was 0% (p = 0.0323).

The study comprised 160 adult patients with unruptured bAVMs surgically treated in Burdenko NMC (Moscow) in 2009-2017. Mean age: 33.4 ± 10лет. Clinical presentations were: seizures in 99 (61.9%), chronical headaches-49 (30.6%), ischemic symptoms-4 (2.5%), asymptomatic in 8 (5%) patients. Spetzler-Martin scale: I-18 pt. (11.3%), II-71 pt. (44.4%), III-60 pt. (37.5%), IV-11 pt. (6.8%). Good outcomes (mRS = 0-2) at discharge were achieved in 149 (93.1%), satisfactory (mRS-3)-9 (5.6%). Follow-up was complete for 97 (60.6%) patients, mean-59.3 (13-108 month). Excellent outcomes (mRS = 0-1) reached in 94.8%. For epilepsy patients, Engel I outcome was found in 50 (84.8%); for chronic headaches, 43 (66.1%) patients reported improvement. Postoperative visual field defects were followed in 22 of 55 (40%), complete recovery was reported in 6 (27%) and partial recovery in 8 (36%) patients. Overall, our results support the conclusion that surgery for low-grade bAVMs (S-M I-II) is a beneficial, low-risk option.",2021,2021,Acta neurochirurgica.

27169498,Multimodal Treatment Strategy for Spetzler-Martin Grade III Arteriovenous Malformations of the Brain.,"The Spetzler-Martin (S-M) grading scale was developed to assess the risk of postoperative neurological complications after the surgical treatment of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the brain. Treatment-associated morbidity and poor outcomes are particularly relevant to Grade III AVMs and improving the safety while attaining acceptable cure rates still poses a challenge. A multimodal treatment strategy combining surgery, embolization, and radiosurgery is recommended for S-M Grade III AVMs because of the surgical risk. Grade III AVMs are the heterogeneous group that has been further divided into subgroups according to the size, the location in eloquent cortex, and the presence of deep venous drainage. The risks associated with different treatment modalities vary depending on the subgroup, and the rating scales have been further refined to predict the risk more accurately and help determine the most appropriate treatment choice. Previous results for the treatment of S-M Grade III AVMs vary widely among studies, and the treatment modalities are also different in each study. Being familiar with previous treatment results is essential for improving treatment outcomes.",2017 Feb 15,2017,Neurologia medico-chirurgica,57,2,73-81,eng,False,10.2176/nmc.ra.2016-0056;nmc-57-0073;10.2176/nmc.ra.2016-0056,Journal Article;Review,"Combined Modality Therapy;Embolization, Therapeutic;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*therapy;Microsurgery;Postoperative Complications/*epidemiology/*prevention & control;Radiosurgery;Treatment Outcome",

METHODS: One hundred and forty-two children were treated with GKS at the authors' institution between April 1997 and March 2006; of these, 103 patients with a mean follow-up of 26.4 months (range 6-96 months) were included. The mean age at presentation was 13.9 years (range 3-18 years). Eighty-six (83%) patients presented with hemorrhage. In 57 children the AVMs were Spetzler-Martin Grade I or II, and in 46 the AVMs were Grades III, IV, or V. The mean volume of the AVMs was 2.4 ml (range 0.04-23.3 ml). The mean marginal dose administered was 24.4 Gy (range 15-27 Gy). Follow-up angiography was advised at 2 years after GKS and yearly thereafter. In patients with residual AVMs, follow-up angiography was advised yearly until 4 years after GKS. If residual AVM was present, even on a follow-up angiogram obtained 4 years postsurgery, the GKS was considered a failure. RESULTS: Complete obliteration of the AVM was documented in 34 (87%) of the 39 patients with complete angiographic follow-up. The 3- and 4-year actuarial rates of nidus obliteration were 66 and 86% respectively. Three patients (2.9%) experienced bleeding during the latency period, and symptomatic radiation-induced edema was noted in four patients (3.8%). A significantly higher incidence of radiation edema was noted in patients with AVM volumes greater than 3 ml and in patients with Spetzler-Martin Grade IV and V AVMs. CONCLUSIONS: Gamma Knife radiosurgery is an effective modality for the treatment of intracranial AVMs in children, yielding high obliteration rates and low complication rates.",2007 Dec,2007,Journal of neurosurgery,107,6 Suppl,479-84,eng,False,10.3171/ped-07/12/479,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Brain Edema/etiology;Cerebral Angiography;Cerebral Hemorrhage/epidemiology;Child;Child, Preschool;Embolization, Therapeutic/adverse effects;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;India;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects/statistics & numerical data;Retrospective Studies;Risk Assessment;Treatment Outcome",

15871510,Integration of three-dimensional corticospinal tractography into treatment planning for gamma knife surgery.,"OBJECT: In the radiosurgical treatment of critically located lesions, the effort to minimize the risk of complication is essential. In this study the integration of diffusion-tensor (DT) imaging-based tractography was clinically applied to treatment planning for gamma knife surgery (GKS). METHODS: Seven patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations located adjacent to the corticospinal tract (CST) underwent this technique. Data provided by DT imaging were acquired before the frame was affixed to the patient's head and the CST of the DT tractography was created using our original software. Stereotactic three-dimensional imaging studies were obtained after frame fixation and then coregistered with the data from DT tractography. After image fusion of the two studies, the combined images were transported to a GKS treatment-planning workstation. The spatial relationship between the dose distribution and the CST was clearly demonstrated within the 2 hours it took to complete the entire imaging process. The univariate logistic regression analysis of transient or permanent motor complications revealed a significant independent correlation with the volume of the CST that received 25 Gy or more and with a maximum dose to the CST (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The integration of DT tractography into the GKS treatment planning was highly useful in confirming the dose to the CST during treatment planning.",2005 Apr,2005,Journal of neurosurgery,102,4,673-7,eng,False,10.3171/jns.2005.102.4.0673,Clinical Trial;Journal Article,"Adult;Child;Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Female;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;Patient Care Planning;Postoperative Complications;Pyramidal Tracts/*diagnostic imaging;Radiography;Radiosurgery/*methods;Software",
37522732,A Review of Preoperative Embolization Effectiveness in Patients With Arteriovenous Malformations.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Preoperative embolization of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) remains controversial. This study sought to analyze the cost-effectiveness of preoperative embolization of AVMs. METHODS: Patients who underwent AVM resection at a single institute (January 1, 2015-December 31, 2020) were analyzed. Patients with preoperative embolization (embolization cohort) were compared with those without preoperative embolization (nonembolization cohort). Cost-effectiveness score (CE) was the primary outcome of interest and was determined by dividing the total 1-year cost by effectiveness, which was derived from a validated preoperative to last follow-up change in the modified Rankin Scale utility score. A lower CE signifies a more cost-effective treatment strategy. RESULTS: Of 188 patients, 88 (47%) underwent preoperative embolization. The mean (SD) total cost was higher in the embolization group than in the nonembolization group ($117 594 [$102 295] vs $84 348 [$82 326]; P < .001). The mean (SD) CE was higher in the embolization cohort ($336 476 [$1 303 842]) than in the nonembolization cohort ($100 237 [$246 255]; P < .001). Among patients with Spetzler-Martin (SM) grade I and II AVMs, the mean (SD) CE was higher in the embolization (n = 40) than in the nonembolization (n = 72) cohort ($164 950 [$348 286] vs $69 021 [$114 938]; P = .004). Among patients with SM grade III AVMs, the mean (SD) CE was lower in the embolization (n = 33) than in the nonembolization (n = 25) cohort ($151 577 [$219 130] vs $189 195 [$446 335]; P = .006). The mean (SD) CE was not significantly different between cohorts among patients with higher-grade AVMs (embolization cohort [n = 3] vs nonembolization cohort [n = 15]: $503 639 [$776 492] vs $2 048 419 [$4 794 758]; P = .49). The mean CE for embolized SM grade III aneurysms was nonsignificant in the ruptured group; however, for the unruptured group, CE was significantly higher in the embolization cohort (n = 26; $160 871 [$240 535]) relative to the nonembolization cohort (n = 15; $108 152 [$166 446]) ( P = .006).

24662509,Computational fractal-based analysis of brain arteriovenous malformation angioarchitecture.,"BACKGROUND: Neuroimaging is the gold standard for diagnosis and follow-up of brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs), but no objective parameter has been validated for the assessment of the nidus angioarchitecture and for prognostication following treatment. The fractal dimension (FD), which is a mathematical parameter able to quantify the space-filling properties and roughness of natural objects, may be useful in quantifying the geometrical complexity of bAVMs nidus. OBJECTIVE: To propose FD as a neuroimaging biomarker of the nidus angioarchitecture, which might be related to radiosurgical outcome. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 54 patients who had undergone stereotactic radiosurgery for the treatment of bAVMs. The quantification of the geometric complexity of the vessels forming the nidus, imaged in magnetic resonance imaging, was assessed by means of the box-counting method to obtain the fractal dimension. RESULTS: FD was found to be significantly associated with the size (P = .03) and volume (P < .001) of the nidus, in addition to several angioarchitectural parameters. A nonsignificant association between clinical outcome and FD was observed (area under the curve, 0.637 [95% confidence interval, 0.49-0.79]), indicative of a potential inverse relationship between FD and bAVM obliteration. CONCLUSION: In our exploratory methodological research, we showed that the FD is an objective computer-aided parameter for quantifying the geometrical complexity and roughness of the bAVM nidus. The results suggest that more complex bAVM angioarchitecture, having higher FD values, might be related to decreased response to radiosurgery and that the FD of the bAVM nidus could be used as a morphometric neuroimaging biomarker.",2014 Jul,2014,Neurosurgery,75,1,72-9,eng,False,10.1227/NEU.0000000000000353;10.1227/NEU.0000000000000353,Journal Article,"Adult;Aged;Female;*Fractals;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted/*methods;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Neuroimaging/*methods;Radiosurgery/methods;Retrospective Studies",
33770182,Rotational Angiography-Based Gamma Knife Radiosurgery for Brain Arteriovenous Malformations: Preliminary Therapeutic Outcomes of the Novel Method.,"BACKGROUND: High-definition vascular imaging is desirable for treatment planning in Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS; Elekta AB) for brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVMs). Currently, rotational angiography (RA) provides the clearest 3-dimensional visualization of niduses with high spatial resolution; however, its efficacy for GKRS has not been clarified. At our institution, RA has been integrated into GKRS (RA-GKRS) for better treatment planning and outcomes since 2015. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate RA-GKRS outcomes of BAVMs and compare them with conventional GKRS (c-GKRS) outcomes. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the radiosurgical outcomes of 50 BAVMs treated with RA-GKRS compared with the 306 BAVMs treated with c-GKRS. Considering possible differences in the baseline characteristics, we also created propensity score-matched cohorts and compared the radiosurgical outcomes between them to ensure comparability. RESULTS: The obliteration time was shorter in the RA-GKRS group (cumulative rate, 88% vs 65% at 4 yr [P = .001]). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis demonstrated that the RA-GKRS group (hazard ratio 2.38, 95% CI 1.58-3.60; P = .001) had a better obliteration rate. The cumulative 4-yr post-GKRS hemorrhage rates were 4.0% and 2.6% in the RA-GKRS and c-GKRS groups, respectively (P = .558). There was a trend toward early post-GKRS signal change in the RA-GKRS group compared with the c-GKRS group (cumulative rate, 38% vs 29% at 2 yr; P = .118). Those results were also confirmed in the matched cohort analyses. CONCLUSION: The integration of RA into GKRS is promising and may provide earlier nidus obliteration.",2021 Jun 15,2021,Neurosurgery,89,1,60-69,eng,True,10.1093/neuros/nyab066;6189621;10.1093/neuros/nyab066,Journal Article,Angiography;Arteriovenous Anastomosis;Brain/*surgery;Cerebrovascular Disorders/*surgery;Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/surgery;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome,Brain arteriovenous malformation;Gamma Knife radiosurgery;Rotational angiography;Stereotactic radiosurgery
28681423,Multistage stereotactic radiosurgery for large cerebral arteriovenous malformations using the Gamma Knife platform.,"PURPOSE: Radiosurgery is an established technique to treat cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Obliteration of larger AVMs (> 10-15 cm(3) or diameter > 3 cm) in a single session is challenging with current radiosurgery platforms due to toxicity. We present a novel technique of multistage stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for large intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVM) using the Gamma Knife system. MATERIALS/METHODS: Eighteen patients with large (> 10-15 cm(3) or diameter > 3 cm) AVMs, which were previously treated using a staged SRS technique on the Cyberknife platform, were retrospectively selected for this study. The AVMs were contoured and divided into 3-8 subtargets to be treated sequentially in a staged approach at half to 4 week intervals. The prescription dose ranged from 15 Gy to 20 Gy, depending on the subtarget number, volume, and location. Gamma Knife plans using multiple collimator settings were generated and optimized. The coordinates of each shot from the initial plan covering the total AVM target were extracted based on their relative positions within the frame system. The shots were regrouped based on their location with respect to the subtarget contours to generate subplans for each stage. The delivery time of each shot for a subtarget was decay corrected with (60) Co for staging the treatment course to generate the same dose distribution as that planned for the total AVM target. Conformality indices and dose-volume analysis were performed to evaluate treatment plans. RESULTS: With the shot redistribution technique, the composite dose for the multistaged treatment of multiple subtargets is equivalent to the initial plan for total AVM target. Gamma Knife plans resulted in an average PTV coverage of 96.3 ± 0.9% and a PITV of 1.23 ± 0.1. The resulting Conformality indices, V(12Gy) and R(50) dose spillage values were 0.76 ± 0.05, 3.4 ± 1.8, and 3.1 ± 0.5 respectively. CONCLUSION: The Gamma Knife system can deliver a multistaged conformal dose to treat large AVMs when correcting for translational setup errors of each shot at each staged treatment.",2017 Oct,2017,Medical physics,44,10,5010-5019,eng,False,10.1002/mp.12455;MP12455;10.1002/mp.12455,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Arteriovenous Fistula/*radiotherapy;Child;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*radiotherapy;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/*instrumentation;Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",Gamma Knife;arteriovenous malformation;stereotactic radiosurgery
23547977,Tomotherapy radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations--current possibilities and future options with helical tomotherapy dynamic jaws?,"This planning study was performed to compare stereotactic linac based radiosurgery of Arteriovenous Malformations (AVM) with current Helical Tomotherapy (HT) and future HT techniques. For 10 patients with AVM, dose distributions and treatment times of ""regular"" HT delivery (Reg 2.5/1/0.6 cm field width), Running-Start-Stop Treatment (RSS 5/2.5 cm), Axial Mode (Axial 5 cm) and Dynamic Jaw/Dynamic Couch delivery with a maximum field width of 5 cm (DJDC 5) were analysed and compared to linac-based stereotactic radiosurgery. Axial produced the fastest treatment (Axial 4:47 min vs. Linac 32:42 min) at the cost of large brain exposure (V10% 289 ml). Except for Reg 0.6, all other HT techniques achieved significantly shorter treatment times than linac-based treatment (e.g. Reg 1, 19:42 min, DJDC 6:30 min). However, high-dose brain exposure (V60%) was higher in all HT plans (e.g. Reg 0.6, 10 ml, Linac 9 ml), and only Reg 0.6 showed better low-dose exposure (V10% of 167 ml vs. 199 ml, not significant).

In this study, the treatment outcomes of hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT) with CyberKnife (CK) for large AVMs and AVMs in eloquent areas were evaluated. This study retrospectively evaluated 38 consecutive patients with AVMs treated with HSRT in the Japanese Red Cross Medical Center between August 2010 and July 2015. Obliteration rates and hemorrhage rates at 3- and 5-years of follow-up were calculated. Factors for hemorrhage and obliteration were analyzed with logistic regression analysis. Fourteen (36.8%) patients had a history of hemorrhage. Twenty (52.6%) AVMs were larger than 10 mL, and 34 (89.5%) AVMs were located in eloquent areas. The majority of the AVMs (84.2%) were classified into high grades (grades 3, 4, and 5) using the Spetzler-Martin grading scale. The median modified radiosurgery-based AVM score was 2.05, and the median Virginia Radiosurgery AVM Score was 3. The mean marginal dose was 24.5 ± 2.5 Gy. Twenty-three and 15 patients received three- and five-fraction stereotactic radiotherapy, respectively. At 3 and 5 years posttreatment, two (2.0%/year) and six (6.7%/year) patients had hemorrhage with obliteration rates of 15.2% and 16.7%, respectively. AVM localization in eloquent areas was a risk factor for obliteration failure. This study revealed that HSRT with CK for large AVMs and AVMs located in eloquent areas contributed to hemorrhage risk reduction and obliteration, at least in the early stages.",2022 Oct 15,2022,Neurologia medico-chirurgica,62,10,445-450,eng,False,10.2176/jns-nmc.2022-0033;10.2176/jns-nmc.2022-0033,Journal Article,Follow-Up Studies;Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/etiology/radiotherapy/surgery;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects;Retrospective Studies;Risk Factors;Treatment Outcome,CyberKnife;arteriovenous malformation;hypofraction;outcome;stereotactic radiotherapy
30587419,Long-term follow up data on difficult to treat intracranial arteriovenous malformations treated with the CyberKnife.,"INTRODUCTION: The CyberKnife, a frameless, robotic, stereotactic device, has been developed to radiosurgically treat arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). While most AVMs are obliterated within two-to-three years, a subset remain recalcitrant; long-term data on these difficult to treat AVMs are limited in the neurosurgical literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent CyberKnife treatment for intracranial AVMs at a single U.S. institution between 2002 and 2012, whose AVMs had failed to obliterate within 48 months or longer from the treatment start date, were eligible for inclusion. RESULTS: Eleven patients (9 AVMs; 7 males, 2 females) were followed for an average of 85.2 months (range 56.2-119.4). The median lesion size was 3.5 cm (range: 2.8-8.0 cm) and median Spetzler-Martin grade was 3 (range: 2-5). All AVMs were treated with one radiation dose (median prescribed dose was 18.0 Gy; median D(max): 23.7 Gy). Six (66.7%) were obliterated in a median time of 84 months (range: 52-94 months), while 3 (33.3%) remained active after a median of 90.8 months (range 69.7-119.4). Transient, post-radiosurgery adverse radiation effects occurred in 5 (55.6%) cases. One (11.1%) patient had an acute hemorrhage from the AVM after radiosurgery. Four (44.4%) patients underwent repeat radiosurgery and/or embolization. Three of these lesions eventually obliterated, while 1 did not. CONCLUSION: The median time to obliteration was 84 months. Two-thirds of AVMs which persisted for over 4 years following initial radiosurgery treatment eventually obliterated. Transient post-radiosurgery adverse effects were common; delayed hemorrhages were rare in our case series.",2019 Mar,2019,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society,61,,120-123,eng,False,S0967-5868(18)31078-6;10.1016/j.jocn.2018.10.109;S0967-5868(18)31078-6;10.1016/j.jocn.2018.10.109,Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Child;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/*methods;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult,AVMs;CyberKnife;Follow up;Multimodal treatment;Patient outcomes;Radiosurgery
32698881,Late complications of radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations: report of 5 cases of chronic encapsulated intracerebral hematomas and review of the literature.,"BACKGROUND: Chronic encapsulated intracerebral hematomas (CEIHs) are a rare, late complication of radiosurgery for intracranial AVM. We present 5 cases treated mostly by surgical excision and review the literature. METHODS: Patients (age 39, 42, 36, 31, 62) presented with headache, paresthesia, hemiparesis or were asymptomatic. CEIHs presented 10 to 13 years (median 12 years) post radiosurgery. Three patients had demonstrated early radiation induced changes post radiosurgery. Angiographic cure, assessed with DSA, was present in all cases except 1 case with a small nidus remnant. MRI demonstrated mixed lesions with a solid enhancing part, organized hematoma and extensive surrounding edema while three cases had also a cystic component. RESULTS: Excision of the CEIHs with complete or partial removal of the capsule was performed in 4 patients and resulted in marked clinical improvement. One patient was managed conservatively with administration of steroids as surgery was judged excessively hazardous with eventual stabilization of his symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: CEIHs are rare, late complications of radiosurgery for cranial AVM. They may be asymptomatic or provoke symptoms and may be preceded by early radiation induced changes. Complete removal of CEIHS is an effective treatment. Because of the long latency period of CEIHs, patients who had radiosurgery for brain AVMs should be followed by MRI at least 10 years even after complete obliteration.",2020 Jul 22,2020,"Radiation oncology (London, England)",15,1,177,eng,False,10.1186/s13014-020-01616-1;177;10.1186/s13014-020-01616-1;1616;10.1186/s13014-020-01616-1,Case Reports;Journal Article;Review,Adult;Cerebral Hemorrhage/*etiology;Chronic Disease;Female;Hematoma/*etiology;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*radiotherapy;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects,

29351691,OUT-OF-FIELD DOSES IN CHILDREN TREATED FOR LARGE ARTERIOVENOUS MALFORMATIONS USING HYPOFRACTIONATED GAMMA KNIFE RADIOSURGERY AND INTENSITY-MODULATED RADIATION THERAPY.,"The purpose of this study was to measure out-of-field organ doses in two anthropomorphic child phantoms for the treatment of large brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) using hypofractionated gamma knife (GK) radiosurgery and to compare these with an alternative treatment using intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Target volume was identical in size and shape in all cases. Radiophotoluminescent (RPL), thermoluminescent (TL) and optically stimulated luminescent (OSL) dosimeters were used for out-of-field dosimetry during GK treatment and a good agreement within 1-2% between results was shown. In addition, the use of multiple dosimetry systems strengthens the reliability of the findings. The number of GK isocentres was confirmed to be important for the magnitude of out-of-field doses. Measured GK doses for the same distance from the target, when expressed per target dose and isocentre, were comparable in both phantoms. GK out-of-field doses averaged for both phantoms were evaluated to be 120 mGy/Gy for eyes then sharply reduced to 20 mGy/Gy for mandible and slowly reduced up to 0.8 mGy/Gy for testes. Taking into account the fractionation regimen used to treat AVM patients, the total treatment organ doses to the out-of-field organs were calculated and compared with IMRT.

16961142,Recurrent late cerebral necrosis with aggressive characteristics after radiosurgical treatment of an arteriovenous malformation. Case report.,"/Late cerebral radiation necrosis usually occurs within 3 years of stereotactic radiosurgery. The authors report on a case of recurrent radiation necrosis with rapid clinical deterioration and imaging findings resembling those of a malignant glioma. This 68-year-old man, who had a history of a left posterior temporal and thalamic arteriovenous malformation (AVM) treated with linear accelerator radiosurgery 13 years before presentation and complicated by radiation necrosis 11 years before presentation, exhibited new-onset mixed aphasia, right hemiparesis, and right hemineglect. Imaging studies demonstrated hemorrhage and an enlarging, heterogeneously enhancing mass in the region of the previously treated AVM. The patient was treated medically with corticosteroid agents, and stabilized temporarily. Unfortunately, his condition worsened precipitously soon thereafter, requiring the placement of a shunt for relief of obstructive hydrocephalus. Further surgical intervention was offered, but the patient's family opted for hospice care instead. The patient died 10 weeks after initially presenting to the authors' institution, and the results of an autopsy demonstrated radiation necrosis. Symptomatic radiation necrosis can occur more than a decade after stereotactic radiosurgery, necessitating patient follow up during a longer period of time than currently practiced. Furthermore, there is a need for more careful reporting on the natural history of such cases to clarify the pathogenesis of very late and recurrent radiation necrosis after radiosurgery and to define patient groups with a higher risk for these entities.",2006 Sep,2006,Journal of neurosurgery,105,3,455-60,eng,False,10.3171/jns.2006.105.3.455,Case Reports;Journal Article,Aged;Brain/*pathology/*radiation effects;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Necrosis;Postoperative Complications;Radiation Injuries;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects;Recurrence,
28735125,Management of Arteriovenous Malformations Associated with Developmental Venous Anomalies: A Literature Review and Report of 2 Cases.,"BACKGROUND: Classification of cerebrovascular malformations has revealed intermediary lesions that warrant further review owing to their unusual presentation and management. We present 2 cases of arteriovenous malformation (AVM) associated with a developmental venous anomaly (DVA), and discuss the efficacy of previously published management strategies. METHODS: Two cases of AVMs associated with DVA were identified, and a literature search for published cases between 1980 and 2016 was conducted. Patient demographic data and clinical features were documented. RESULTS: In case 1, a 29-year-old female presenting with parenchymal hemorrhage and left homonymous hemianopia was found to have a right parieto-occipital AVM fed from the anterior cerebral, middle cerebral, and posterior cerebral arteries, with major venous drainage to the superior sagittal sinus. In case 2, imaging in a 34-year-old female evaluated for night tremors and incontinence revealed a left parietal AVM with venous drainage to the superior sagittal sinus. Including our 2 cases, 22 cases of coexisting AVMs and DVAs have been reported in the literature. At presentation, 68% had radiographic evidence of hemorrhage. Stereotactic radiosurgery was performed in 7 cases, embolization in 6 cases, surgical resection in 4 cases, and multimodal therapy in 5 cases. Radiography at follow-up demonstrated successful AVM obliteration in 67% of cases (12 of 18). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with coexisting AVMs and DVAs tend to have a hemorrhagic presentation. Contrary to traditional AVM management, in these cases it is important to preserve the draining vein via the DVA to ensure a safe, sustained circulatory outflow of the associated brain parenchyma while achieving safe AVM obliteration.",2017 Oct,2017,World neurosurgery,106,,563-569,eng,False,S1878-8750(17)31142-7;10.1016/j.wneu.2017.07.042;S1878-8750(17)31142-7;10.1016/j.wneu.2017.07.042,Case Reports;Journal Article;Review,"Adult;Cerebral Arteries/abnormalities;Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology;Embolization, Therapeutic/methods;Female;Humans;Incidental Findings;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*therapy;Magnetic Resonance Angiography;Radiosurgery/methods;Superior Sagittal Sinus/abnormalities;Tomography, X-Ray Computed",Arteriovenous malformation;Coexisting malformation;CyberKnife radiosurgery;Developmental venous anomaly;Glue embolization;Multimodal treatment;Stereotactic radiosurgery

37779178,Impact of tailored multimodal treatment for unruptured brain arteriovenous malformation: comparison with a randomized trial of unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations.,"PURPOSE: The first randomized controlled study on unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVM), the ARUBA trial, demonstrate the superiority of medical management; however, it failed to completely rule out the efficacy of therapeutic interventions due to several limitations. This study aimed to examine the outcomes of multimodal interventional treatment for bAVM in terms of safety and efficacy. METHODS: We reviewed 226 consecutive patients with unruptured bAVM admitted to our institute between 2002 and 2022. Treatment methods were divided into medical management and therapeutic intervention, including microsurgery, stereotactic surgery, and endovascular intervention. First, the choice of therapeutic modalities was assessed in the pre-ARUBA (before February 2014) and post-ARUBA (after March 2014) eras. Second, the incidence of symptomatic stroke or death and functional prognosis with a modified Rankin scale (mRS) score of ≥2 at 5 years was compared between the medical management and therapeutic intervention. RESULTS: In the pre- and post-ARUBA groups, 73% and 84% of patients underwent therapeutic interventions, respectively (p = 0.053). The rate of symptomatic stroke or death was lower in patients who underwent interventional therapies than in those who underwent medical management (9.7% vs. 22%, p = 0.022); however, the opposite was observed in the ARUBA trial (31% vs. 10%). The annual incidence of stroke or death was also lower in the interventional therapy group (4.3%/y vs. 1.8%/year, hazard ratio = 0.45, 95% confidence interval: 0.18-1.08, p = 0.032). The rate of mRS score of ≥2 after a 5-year follow-up was 18% and 6% in the medical treatment and intervention groups (p = 0.14). CONCLUSIONS: The therapeutic intervention rate did not decrease, even after the publication of the ARUBA trial. The rate of stroke or death was lower in the intervention group, indicating that a tailored choice of multimodality is safe and effective for managing unruptured bAVM.",2023 Dec,2023,Acta neurochirurgica,165,12,3779-3785,eng,False,10.1007/s00701-023-05815-z;10.1007/s00701-023-05815-z;10.1007/s00701-023-05815-z,Journal Article;Review,Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery;Treatment Outcome;Neurosurgical Procedures/methods;*Stroke/surgery;Combined Modality Therapy;*Radiosurgery/methods;Brain;Retrospective Studies;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic,ARUBA;Brain arteriovenous malformation;Multimodal treatment
34775089,Seizure Rates After Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Cerebral AVMs: A Single Center Study.,"OBJECTIVES: Seizure control after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is an area of growing interest, with previous studies reporting up to 70% seizure freedom after treatment. The goals of this study were to identify specific patient and AVM characteristics associated with seizure presentation and seizure outcomes after SRS treatment. METHODS: A retrospective review of consecutive patients undergoing SRS for brain AVMs between 2009 and 2019 at our institution was conducted. Chi-squared and logistic regression analyses were utilized to identify patient and AVM factors associated with preoperative seizure presentation and development of new onset seizures after SRS. RESULTS: Two hundred ten consecutive patients presenting with AVMs treated with SRS were reviewed. Factors associated with seizure presentation included larger AVM size (P = 0.02), superficial venous drainage (P < 0.05), and parietal location (P = 0.04). Of 188 patients with follow-up (90%), 30 patients presented with seizures and 14 (47%) were seizure-free post-SRS. Of 158 patients presenting without seizure, 29 (18%) developed de novo seizures during follow-up. De novo post-SRS seizures were associated with prior craniotomy for resection of AVM (P = 0.04), post-treatment hemorrhage (P = 0.02), parietal location (P = 0.05), adverse effect requiring steroids (P < 0.01), and adverse effect requiring surgery (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Seizures are a common presentation of brain AVMs and can be treated effectively with SRS. However, seizures can also be a complication of SRS and are associated with post-treatment hemorrhage, edema, and need for future open surgery.",2022 Feb,2022,World neurosurgery,158,,e583-e591,eng,False,S1878-8750(21)01722-8;10.1016/j.wneu.2021.11.021;S1878-8750(21)01722-8;10.1016/j.wneu.2021.11.021,Journal Article,Brain;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects;Retrospective Studies;Seizures/surgery;Treatment Outcome,Anti-epileptic drugs;Arteriovenous malformation;Post-radiosurgery hemorrhage;Seizures;Stereotactic radiosurgery
33618042,"Does Endovascular Treatment with Curative Intention Have Benefits for Treating High-Grade Arteriovenous Malformation versus Radiosurgery? Efficacy, Safety, and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.","BACKGROUND: The treatment of high-grade arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) remains challenging. Microsurgery provides a rapid and complete occlusion compared with other options but is associated with undesirable morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to compare the occlusion rates, incidence of unfavorable outcomes, and cost-effectiveness of embolization and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) as a curative treatment for high-grade AVMs. METHODS: A retrospective series of 57 consecutive patients with high-grade AVM treated with embolization or SRS, with the aim of achieving complete occlusion, was analyzed. Demographic, clinical, and angioarchitectonic variables were collected. Both treatments were compared for the occlusion rate and procedure-related complications. In addition, a cost-effectiveness analysis was performed. RESULTS: Thirty patients (52.6%) were men and 27 (47.4%) were women (mean age, 39 years). AVMs were unruptured in 43 patients (75.4%), and ruptured in 14 patients (24.6%). The presence of deep venous drainage, nidus volume, perforated arterial supply, and eloquent localization was more frequent in the SRS group. Complications such as hemorrhage or worsening of previous seizures were more frequent in the embolization group. No significant differences were observed in the occlusion rates or in the time necessary to achieve occlusion between the groups. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for endovascular treatment versus SRS was $53.279. CONCLUSIONS: Both techniques achieved similar occlusion rates, but SRS carried a lower risk of complications. Staged embolization may be associated with a greater risk of hemorrhage, whereas SRS was shown to have a better cost-effectiveness ratio. These results support SRS as a better treatment option for high-grade AVMs.",2021 May,2021,World neurosurgery,149,,e178-e187,eng,True,S1878-8750(21)00246-1;10.1016/j.wneu.2021.02.053;S1878-8750(21)00246-1;10.1016/j.wneu.2021.02.053,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Cerebral Intraventricular Hemorrhage/physiopathology;Child;Child, Preschool;Cost-Benefit Analysis;Endovascular Procedures/economics/*methods;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/physiopathology/*therapy;Intracranial Hemorrhages/epidemiology/physiopathology;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/economics/*methods;Seizures/physiopathology;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",Arteriovenous malformation;Embolization;Endovascular;Radiosurgery;Spetzler-Martin Scale;Stereotactic

METHODS AND RESULTS: The results of 53 patients with central AVMs and 255 patients with AVMs at other locations treated with GKS at our center between April 1997 and March 2005 with minimum follow-up of 1 year were analyzed. CENTRAL AVMS: Forty of these 53 AVMs were Spetzler-Martin grade III, 11 were grade IV, and 2 were grade V. The mean AVM volume was 4.3 cm(3) (range 0.1-36.6 cm(3)). The mean marginal dose given was 23.3 Gy (range 16-25 Gy). The mean follow-up was 28 months (range 12-96 months). Check angiograms were advised at 2 years after GKS and yearly thereafter in the presence of residual AVM till 4 years. Presence of a residual AVM on an angiogram at 4 years after radiosurgery was considered as radiosurgical failure. Complete obliteration of the AVM was documented in 14 (74%) of the 19 patients with complete angiographic follow-up. Significantly lower obliteration rates (37% vs. 100%) were seen in larger AVMs (>3 cm(3)) and AVMs of higher (IV and V) Spetzler-Martin grades (28% vs. 100%). The 3- and 4-year actuarial rates of nidus obliteration were 68% and 74%, respectively. Eight patients (15%) developed radiation edema with a statistically significantly higher incidence in patients with AVM volume >3 cm(3) and in patients with Spetzler-Martin grade IV and V AVMs. Five patients (9.4%) had hemorrhage in the period of latency. COMPARISON OF RESULTS WITH AVMS AT OTHER LOCATIONS: Patients with central AVMs presented at a younger age (mean age 22.7 years vs. 29 years), with a very high proportion (81% vs. 63%) presenting with hemorrhage. Significantly higher incidence of radiation edema (15% vs. 5%) and lower obliteration rates (74% vs. 93%) were seen in patients with central AVMs. CONCLUSIONS: GKS is an effective modality of treatment for central AVMs, though relatively lower obliteration rates and higher complication rates are seen compared to AVMs at other locations.",2009 Dec,2009,Acta neurochirurgica,151,12,1575-82,eng,True,10.1007/s00701-009-0335-0;10.1007/s00701-009-0335-0,Comparative Study;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Basal Ganglia/pathology/*surgery;Brain Stem/pathology/*surgery;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/pathology/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Outcome Assessment, Health Care/methods;Radiation Dosage;Radiography;Radiosurgery/methods/*statistics & numerical data;Retrospective Studies;Thalamus/pathology/*surgery;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",
33354852,Quantification of hemodynamics of cerebral arteriovenous malformations after stereotactic radiosurgery using 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging.,"Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is used to treat cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). However, early evaluation of efficacy is difficult as structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) often does not demonstrate appreciable changes within the first 6 months. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of four-dimensional (4D) flow MRI to quantify hemodynamic changes after SRS as early as 2 months. This was a retrospective observational study, which included 14 patients with both pre-SRS and post-SRS imaging obtained at multiple time points from 1 to 27 months after SRS. A 3T MRI Scanner was used to obtain T(2) single-shot fast spin echo, time-of-flight MRA, and postcontrast 4D flow with three-dimensional velocity encoding between 150 and 200 cm/s. Post-hoc two-dimensional cross-sectional flow was measured for the dominant feeding artery, the draining vein, and the corresponding contralateral artery as a control. Measurements were performed by two independent observers, and reproducibility was assessed. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare differences in flow, circumference, and pulsatility between the feeding artery and the contralateral artery both before and after SRS; and differences in nidus size and flow and circumference of the feeding artery and draining vein before and after SRS. Arterial flow (L/min) decreased in the primary feeding artery (mean: 0.1 ± 0.07 vs. 0.3 ± 0.2; p < 0.05) and normalized in comparison to the contralateral artery (mean: 0.1 ± 0.07 vs. 0.1 ± 0.07; p = 0.068). Flow decreased in the draining vein (mean: 0.1 ± 0.2 vs. 0.2 ± 0.2; p < 0.05), and the circumference of the draining vein also decreased (mean: 16.1 ± 8.3 vs. 15.7 ± 6.7; p < 0.05). AVM volume decreased after SRS (mean: 45.3 ± 84.8 vs. 38.1 ± 78.7; p < 0.05). However, circumference (mm) of the primary feeding artery remained similar after SRS (mean: 15.7 ± 2.7 vs. 16.1 ± 3.1; p = 0.600). 4D flow may be able to demonstrate early hemodynamic changes in AVMs treated with radiosurgery, and these changes appear to be more pronounced and occur earlier than the structural changes on standard MRI/MRA.

24160482,Stereotactic radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations of the cerebellum.,"OBJECT: Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the posterior fossa have an aggressive natural history and propensity for hemorrhage. Although the cerebellum accounts for the majority of the posterior fossa volume, there is a paucity of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) outcome data for AVMs of this region. The authors sought to evaluate the long-term outcomes and risks of cerebellar AVM radiosurgery. METHODS: This single-institution retrospective analysis reviewed the authors' experience with Gamma Knife surgery during the period 1987-2007. During this time 64 patients (median age 47 years, range 8-75 years) underwent SRS for a cerebellar AVM. Forty-seven patients (73%) presented with an intracranial hemorrhage. The median target volume was 3.85 cm(3) (range 0.2-12.5 cm(3)), and the median marginal dose was 21 Gy (range 15-25 Gy). RESULTS: Arteriovenous malformation obliteration was confirmed by MRI or angiography in 40 patients at a median follow-up of 73 months (range 4-255 months). The actuarial rates of total obliteration were 53% at 3 years, 69% at 4 years, and 76% at 5 and 10 years. Elevated obliteration rates were statistically higher in patients who underwent AVM SRS without prior embolization (p = 0.005). A smaller AVM volume was also associated with a higher rate of obliteration (p = 0.03). Four patients (6%) sustained a hemorrhage during the latency period and 3 died. The cumulative rates of AVM hemorrhage after SRS were 6% at 1, 5, and 10 years. This correlated with an overall annual hemorrhage rate of 2.0% during the latency interval. One patient experienced a hemorrhage 9 years after confirmed MRI and angiographic obliteration. A permanent neurological deficit due to adverse radiation effects developed in 1 patient (1.6%) and temporary complications were seen in 2 additional patients (3.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic radiosurgery proved to be most effective for patients with smaller and previously nonembolized cerebellar malformations.

27368701,Late morphological changes after radiosurgery of brain arteriovenous malformations: an MRI study.,"BACKGROUND: Radiosurgery by Gamma Knife (GK) is an effective treatment for brain arteriovenous malformations (AVM). The aim of the present study was to evaluate late, radiation-induced changes detectable by MRI after AVM radiosurgery in patients treated minimally 10 years prior, with AVM obliteration proven by angiography. METHODS: Thirty-five patients with 37 AVMs were included. AVMs were irradiated 16.6 ± 3.5 years prior with AVM obliteration proven 13 ± 4 years prior. All patients underwent recent MRI examinations, including application of gadolinium-based contrast. RESULTS: In one case, post-irradiative cystic formation with mass effect and signs of hemorrhage requiring surgery was found. Post-gadolinium enhancement at the site of obliterated nidi was apparent in 28 of 37 cases (76 %). In all cases except one, the mean volume of enhancement at the time of review was clearly lower than the volume of the originally irradiated AVM (88 ± 20 %; median 92 %); in one case the extent was 142 % greater than the irradiated AVM. When we compared enhancing and non-enhancing nidi, we found that enhancing nidi were significantly larger than non-enhancing nidi at the time of radiosurgery (4.39 ± 3.35 cc vs. 0.89 ± 0.79 cc, p = 0.004). Enhancement was not influenced by total radiation dose, patient age at the time of irradiation, duration since radiosurgery, or the number of irradiations. Wallerian degeneration was found in nine of 37 cases (24 %); in six cases the optical tracts were affected and visual field defects were proven. In five of nine cases (55.6 %) with Wallerian degeneration previous hemorrhage was present. Dual vascular pathology was found in eight of 35 patients (23 %). CONCLUSIONS: GK radiosurgery for AVM is a safe treatment method although delayed complications may occur.

37140647,Recurrence of brain arteriovenous malformations in pediatric patients: a long-term follow-up study.,"BACKGROUND: Previously thought to be congenital, AVMs have shown evidence of de-novo formation and continued growth, thus shifting thoughts on their pathophysiology. Pediatric AVM patients have been reported to be more prone to develop AVM recurrence after a seemingly complete cure. Therefore, we assessed the risk of AVM treated in childhood to recur in adulthood after a long-term follow-up in our own cohort. METHODS: Control DS-angiography was arranged during 2021-2022 as part of a new protocol for all AVM patients who were under 21 years of age at the time of their treatment and in whom the treatment had occurred at least five years earlier. Angiography was offered only to patients under 50 years of age at the time of the new protocol. The complete eradication of AVM after the primary treatment had been originally confirmed with DSA in every patient. RESULTS: A total of 42 patients participated in the late DSA control, and 41 of them were included in this analysis after excluding the patient diagnosed with HHT. The median age at the time of admission for AVM treatment was 14.6 (IQR 12-19, range 7-21 years) years. The median age at the time of the late follow-up DSA was 33.8 years (IQR 29.8-38.6, range 19.4-47.9 years). Two recurrent sporadic AVMs and one recurrent AVM in a patient with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) were detected. The recurrence rate was 4.9% for sporadic AVMs and 7.1% if HHT-AVM was included. All the recurrent AVMs had originally bled and been treated microsurgically. The patients with sporadic AVM recurrence had been smoking their whole adult lives. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric and adolescent patients are prone to develop recurrent AVMs, even after complete AVM obliteration verified by angiography.

16266046,Testing the radiosurgery-based arteriovenous malformation score and the modified Spetzler-Martin grading system to predict radiosurgical outcome.,"OBJECT: The aim of this study was to validate the radiosurgery-based arteriovenous malformation (AVM) score and the modified Spetzler-Martin grading system to predict radiosurgical outcome. METHODS: One hundred thirty-six patients with brain AVMs were randomly selected. These patients had undergone a linear accelerator radiosurgical procedure at a single center between 1989 and 2000. Patients were divided into four groups according to an AVM score, which was calculated from the lesion volume, lesion location, and patient age (Group 1, AVM score <1; Group 2, AVM score 1-1.49; Group 3, AVM score 1.5-2; and Group 4, AVM score >2). Patients with a Spetzler-Martin Grade III AVM were divided into Grades IIIA (lesion >3 cm) and IIIB (lesion <3 cm). Sixty-two female (45.6%) and 74 male (54.4%) patients with a median age of 37.5 years (mean 37.5 years, range 5-77 years) were followed up for a median of 40 months. The median tumor margin dose was 15 Gy (mean 17.23 Gy, range 15-25 Gy). The proportions of excellent outcomes according to the AVM score were as follows: 91.7% for Group 1, 74.1% for Group 2, 60% for Group 3, and 33.3% for Group 4 (chi-square test, degrees of freedom (df) = 3, p < 0.001). Based on the modified Spetzler-Martin system, Grade I lesions had 88.9% excellent results; Grade II, 69.6%; Grade IIIB, 61.5%; and Grades IIIA and IV, 44.8% (chi-square test, df = 3, p = 0.047). CONCLUSIONS: The radiosurgery-based AVM score can be used accurately to predict excellent results following a single radiosurgical treatment for AVM. The modified Spetzler-Martin system can also predict radiosurgical results for AVMs, thus making it possible to use this system while deciding between surgery and radiosurgery.",2005 Oct,2005,Journal of neurosurgery,103,4,642-8,eng,False,10.3171/jns.2005.103.4.0642,Journal Article;Validation Study,Adolescent;Adult;Age Factors;Aged;Child;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*classification/pathology/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Predictive Value of Tests;Prognosis;Radiosurgery/*methods;Severity of Illness Index;Treatment Outcome,
11692659,The case for and against AVM radiosurgery.,AVM radiosurgery has been in practice for over 30 years and is now a common method to manage properly selected patients with brain AVMs. The techniques have been refined along with our understanding of the expected response. It is this understanding of expected outcomes that should allow a rational discussion of the pertinent issues for management of patients with AVMs. Some patients will require multimodality approaches.

METHODS: We assessed 36 angiographically confirmed AVMs in 36 patients who had been treated with GKRS. 4D-MRA was performed after GKRS and the time intervals were 39.4 ± 26.0 months [mean ± standard deviation (SD)]. 4D-MRA was obtained at 3.0 T after contrast injection, with a measured voxel size of 1 × 1 × 1 mm and a temporal resolution of 1.1 s (13 patients) or a voxel size of 1 × 1 × 2 mm and a temporal resolution of 0.98 s (23 patients). X-ray angiography was performed as the standard reference within 53 ± 47 days (mean ± SD) after MRA. To determine a residual AVM, the 4D-MRA results were independently reviewed by two readers blinded to the X-ray angiography results. We evaluated diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy of 4D-MRA for detection of a residual AVM. RESULTS: A residual AVM was identified in 13 patients (13/36, 36%) on X-ray angiography. According to Readers 1 and 2, 4D-MRA had a sensitivity of 79.6% and 64.3%, a specificity of 90.9% and 100%, a PPV of 84.6% and 100% and an NPV of 90% and 81.5%, respectively, and a diagnostic accuracy of 86.1% for Readers 1 and 2, for detecting residual AVMs after GKRS.

11011729,Localization of cerebral arterovenous malformations using digital angiography.,"Since 1989 we performed stereotactic radiotherapy treatments of cerebral arterovenous malformations (AVM), estimating three-dimensional (3-D) localization and shape of target volumes by the Leksell stereotactic helmet on two orthogonal radiographic projections. Due to the limitations of this method, we developed a new technique for the localization of the target volume using digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and digital image processing. To achieve this result we first developed a method to correct nonlinear distortion of DSA images using spatial relocation of image pixels based on a calibration grid. We then developed an algorithm for localization of the target volume using two independent DSA projections. Target volume coordinates in the helmet system are calculated using two DSA acquisitions taken with a free angle (approximately 90 degrees), one in the AP and the other in the LL direction. The helmet can be freely positioned between the x-ray source and the image plane. The projections of eight reference points inserted in the helmet at a known location, are used to calculate the transformation matrix between the two coordinate systems. We performed numerical and experimental validation of the system. A hypothetical random error (up to 2 mm) on image coordinates of the reference points allowed to determine that the error in target localization was less than 0.2 mm. Using DSA images of target points with a known location within a phantom, the error between calculated and actual location was, on average, 0.30+/-0.13 mm (mean+/-SD), with a maximum error of 0.49 mm. The results of numerical and experimental validations show that the system we have developed allows fast and accurate localization of the center of the target volume and it is suitable for efficient guiding during stereotactic radiosurgery of AVM.",2000 Sep,2000,Medical physics,27,9,2024-30,eng,False,10.1118/1.1288395,Journal Article,"Algorithms;Angiography, Digital Subtraction/*instrumentation/*methods;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/surgery;Radiosurgery/*methods;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Software",
30885872,Hydrocephalus due to a Cavernoma-Like Lesion of an Obliterated Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformation Treated by Embolization and Radiosurgery.,"BACKGROUND: Gamma-Knife radiosurgery can be the treatment of choice for small cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in eloquent brain areas or, in association with endovascular treatment, for large and complex AVMs. Among the possible delayed complications occurring after radiosurgery of AVMs, de novo formation of a cavernoma has only recently been described. The authors report a unique case of communicating hydrocephalus with highly proteinaceous cerebrospinal fluid due to a cavernoma-like lesion of an obliterated cerebral AVM treated by embolization and radiosurgery. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 43-year-old female patient with a left parieto-occipital AVM (Spetzler-Martin grade III) underwent a multimodality treatment comprising several endovascular procedures and Gamma-Knife radiosurgery. At the follow-up angiograms, the AVM was completely obliterated. Twelve years later, she came back to our attention for headache and vomit with the radiological evidence of brain edema, severe hydrocephalus, and a chronic encapsulated intracerebral hematoma. At the beginning, the drainage of hydrocephalus proved ineffective to improve symptoms and edema. Therefore, the surgical resection of both the obliterated AVM and the cavernoma-like lesion-histologically confirmed-was necessary. The hydrocephalus resolved as well as the cerebral edema after 3 weeks, without necessity of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. CONCLUSIONS: In previous neurosurgical literature, the association of a caveroma-like lesion in an obliterated AVM and communicating hydrocephalus with highly proteinaceous cerebrospinal fluid has not yet been discussed. We believe that only the surgical resection of both the obliterated AVM and the cavernoma-like lesion can lead to complete clinical recovery of the hydrocephalus.",2019 Jun,2019,World neurosurgery,126,,491-495,eng,False,S1878-8750(19)30723-5;10.1016/j.wneu.2019.03.068;S1878-8750(19)30723-5;10.1016/j.wneu.2019.03.068,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Adult;Embolization, Therapeutic;Female;Humans;Hydrocephalus/*etiology/*therapy;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*complications/*therapy;Postoperative Complications/therapy;Radiosurgery;Treatment Outcome",Arteriovenous malformation;Cavernoma;Gamma knife;Hydrocephalus

26856372,Using a Machine Learning Approach to Predict Outcomes after Radiosurgery for Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformations.,"Predictions of patient outcomes after a given therapy are fundamental to medical practice. We employ a machine learning approach towards predicting the outcomes after stereotactic radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Using three prospective databases, a machine learning approach of feature engineering and model optimization was implemented to create the most accurate predictor of AVM outcomes. Existing prognostic systems were scored for purposes of comparison. The final predictor was secondarily validated on an independent site's dataset not utilized for initial construction. Out of 1,810 patients, 1,674 to 1,291 patients depending upon time threshold, with 23 features were included for analysis and divided into training and validation sets. The best predictor had an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.71 compared to existing clinical systems of 0.63 across all time points. On the heldout dataset, the predictor had an accuracy of around 0.74 at across all time thresholds with a specificity and sensitivity of 62% and 85% respectively. This machine learning approach was able to provide the best possible predictions of AVM radiosurgery outcomes of any method to date, identify a novel radiobiological feature (3D surface dose), and demonstrate a paradigm for further development of prognostic tools in medical care.",2016 Feb 9,2016,Scientific reports,6,,21161,eng,False,10.1038/srep21161;21161;srep21161;10.1038/srep21161,Journal Article;Multicenter Study;Randomized Controlled Trial,Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*mortality/*radiotherapy;*Machine Learning;Male;Predictive Value of Tests;*Radiosurgery,
25019456,Surgical outcomes after classifying Grade III arteriovenous malformations according to Lawton's modified Spetzler-Martin grading system.,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate microsurgical outcomes after classifying Grade III arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) according to Lawton's modified Spetzler-Martin grading system. METHODS: Of 131 patients with Grade III AVMs, 55 had undergone microsurgery between 1995 and 2010. The 55 AVMs were classified as follows: Grade III-/S1E1V1, Grade III/S2E0V1, Grade III+/S2E1V0, or Grade III*/S3E0V0. The surgical obliteration rate, morbidity rate, and functional outcomes for each subtype were compared before surgery and after follow-up. Additionally, factors related with morbidity were investigated from demographic and morphological characteristics. RESULTS: We observed 18 Grade III-, 16 Grade III, 20 Grade III+, and 1 Grade III* AVMs. Complete resection was achieved in 49 patients (obliteration rate, 89.1%). Incomplete resection rates were higher for Grade III (12.5%) and III+ (15.0%) AVMs than that for Grade III- (5.6%) AVMs. Seven patients (12.7%) presented postoperative deficits, of which 3 (5.4%) experienced disabilities. Patients with Grade III+ (25.0%) had higher morbidity rates than those with other subtypes. Modified Rankin scale scores at the last follow-up indicated unfavorable outcomes for Grades III (18.8%) and III+ (25.0%) AVMs. AVM size (≥3 cm) and non-hemorrhagic type were associated with the occurrence of postoperative deficits (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: The modified classification of Grade III AVMs was useful to predict surgical morbidity and clinical outcomes. We recommend that microsurgery should be used to treat Grade III- AVMs, but should be considered carefully for the treatment of Grades III and III+.",2014 Sep,2014,Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,124,,72-80,eng,False,S0303-8467(14)00221-2;10.1016/j.clineuro.2014.06.017;S0303-8467(14)00221-2;10.1016/j.clineuro.2014.06.017,Case Reports;Journal Article,Adult;Craniotomy;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*classification/*surgery;Male;Microsurgery;Middle Aged;Neurosurgical Procedures/*methods;Radiosurgery;*Severity of Illness Index;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult,Cerebral arteriovenous malformation;Microsurgery;Modified Spetzler–Martin grading scale;Treatment outcome

38899888,Shortened Cerebral Circulation Time Predicts Resistance to Obliteration in High-Flow Brain Arteriovenous Malformations After Stereotactic Radiosurgery.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Treatment selection for brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVMs) is complicated by BAVM size, location, and hemodynamics. Quantitative digital subtraction angiography is used to quantify the hemodynamic impact of BAVMs on cerebral circulation. This study investigated the association between cerebral circulation time and the complete obliteration (CO) rate of BAVMs after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). METHODS: We analyzed the data of 143 patients who underwent SRS for BAVMs between January 2011 and December 2019 in our institute. Their pre-SRS magnetic resonance imaging and angiography images were analyzed to acquire BAVM characteristics and quantitative digital subtraction angiography parameters. Modified cerebral circulation time (mCCT) was defined as the time difference between the bolus arrival time of the ipsilateral cavernous internal carotid artery and that of the parietal vein, as determined from the lateral view of images obtained using digital subtraction angiography. Cox regression with hazard ratios and Kaplan-Meier analyses were conducted to determine the associations between the parameters and BAVM CO after SRS. RESULTS: Of the 143 patients, 101 (70.6%) achieved BAVM CO. According to the multivariate analyses, an increased mCCT (hazard ratio: 1.24, P = .041) was the independent factor associated with BAVM CO after adjustment for age, sex, hemorrhagic presentation, a BAVM volume of >5 cm 3 , and a margin dose of >18 Gy. Individuals with an mCCT of ≤2.32 s had a lower 36-month probability of BAVM CO than did those with an mCCT of >2.32 s (44.1% ± 6.8% vs 63.3% ± 5.6%, P = .034). CONCLUSION: The hemodynamic impact of high-flow BAVM demonstrated by a shortened mCCT is associated with a lower BAVM CO rate after SRS.",2024 Dec 1,2024,Neurosurgery,95,6,1429-1440,eng,True,10.1227/neu.0000000000003036;00006123-990000000-01220;10.1227/neu.0000000000003036,Journal Article,"Humans;*Radiosurgery/methods;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery/diagnostic imaging/radiotherapy;Female;Male;Adult;Middle Aged;*Cerebrovascular Circulation/physiology;*Angiography, Digital Subtraction;Retrospective Studies;Young Adult;Treatment Outcome;Adolescent;Cerebral Angiography;Aged",
25503297,Pathological characteristics of cyst formation following gamma knife surgery for arteriovenous malformation.,"BACKGROUND: The pathological characteristics of cyst development after gamma knife surgery (GKS) for arteriovenous malformation (AVM) were analysed. METHOD: Sixteen male and 12 female patients aged 17-67 years (mean 31.3 years) were retrospectively identified among 868 patients who underwent GKS for AVM at our hospital. The pathological characteristics of the reddish nodular lesion and chronic encapsulated expanding haematoma associated with cyst following GKS for AVM were examined. RESULTS: Cyst was associated with chronic encapsulated expanding haematoma in 13, and with nodular lesion in 12 patients. The nidus volume at GKS was 0.1-36 ml (median 6.0 ml), and the prescription dose at the nidus margin was 18-25 Gy (median 20 Gy). Cyst formation was detected from 1.1 to 16 years (mean 7.3 years) after GKS. Seven of the 12 patients with nodular lesion underwent surgery. Ten of the 13 patients with expanding haematoma underwent surgical removal of expanding haematoma. Histological examination was possible in 17 cases. Dilated capillary vessels with wall damage such as hyalinisation and fibrinoid necrosis, marked protein exudation and haemorrhage were the most common findings. Brain parenchyma was observed among the dilated vessels in some cases. Structureless necrotic tissue was not evident. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that enhanced nodular lesion on magnetic resonance imaging and chronic encapsulated expanding haematoma associated with cyst may have common aetiopathology caused by late radiation effects, mainly consisting of dilated capillary vessels with wall damage. Massive protein exudation from such damaged capillary vessels is important in cyst development.",2015 Feb,2015,Acta neurochirurgica,157,2,293-8,eng,False,10.1007/s00701-014-2298-z;10.1007/s00701-014-2298-z,Case Reports;Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Arteriovenous Fistula/*surgery;Cysts/*etiology/*pathology;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Radiation Injuries/*pathology;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects/methods;Young Adult,
35123239,Predictors of seizure control in patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformation.,"PURPOSE: We aimed to define the predictors of a 2-year seizure-free outcome among patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM). METHODS: A retrospective cohort study recruited patients diagnosed with AVM admitted in the hospital between 2002 and 2020. The demographic data, clinical presentations, seizure semiology, neuro-imaging findings, modality of treatment, and clinical outcomes were compared between the 2-year seizure-free and non-2-year seizure-free groups. A logistic regression model was applied to determine the significant predictors of a 2-year seizure-free outcome. RESULTS: Of 372 radiologically confirmed patients with cerebral AVM, 105 (28.23%) experienced seizure and a 2-year seizure-free outcome was achieved in 76.19%. Most seizures presented as the initial symptom. Generalized onset seizure was the most common seizure semiology. A nidus diameter < 3 cm (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.102; 95% CI 1.129-9.683; p = 0.046) was the independent predictor of a 2-year seizure-free period, whereas underlying epilepsy (aOR 0.141; 95% CI 0.010-0.688; p = 0.015) was an independent predictor against a 2-year seizure-free outcome.

25875580,Effect of Prior Embolization on Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformation Radiosurgery Outcomes: A Case-Control Study.,"BACKGROUND: Embolization before stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM) has been shown to negatively affect obliteration rates, but its impact on the risks of radiosurgery-induced complications and latency period hemorrhage is poorly defined. OBJECTIVE: To determine, in a case-control study, the effect of prior embolization on AVM SRS outcomes. METHODS: We evaluated a database of AVM patients who underwent SRS. Propensity score analysis was used to match the case (embolized nidi) and control (nonembolized nidi) cohorts. AVM angioarchitectural complexity was defined as the sum of the number of major feeding arteries and draining veins to the nidus. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed on the overall study population to determine independent predictors of obliteration and radiation-induced changes. RESULTS: The matching process yielded 242 patients in each cohort. The actuarial obliteration rates were significantly lower in the embolized (31%, 49% at 5, 10 years, respectively) compared with the nonembolized (48%, 64% at 5, 10 years, respectively) cohort (P = .003). In the multivariate analysis for obliteration, lower angioarchitectural complexity (P < .001) and radiologically evident radiation-induced changes (P = .016) were independent predictors, but embolization was not significant (P = .744). In the multivariate analysis for radiologic radiation-induced changes, lack of prior embolization (P = .009) and fewer draining veins (P = .011) were independent predictors. CONCLUSION: The effect of prior embolization on AVM obliteration after SRS may be significantly confounded by nidus angioarchitectural complexity. Additionally, embolization could reduce the risk of radiation-induced changes. Thus, combined embolization and SRS may be warranted for appropriately selected nidi.",2015 Sep,2015,Neurosurgery,77,3,406-17; discussion 417,eng,True,10.1227/NEU.0000000000000772;10.1227/NEU.0000000000000772,Journal Article,"Adult;Case-Control Studies;Databases, Factual;*Embolization, Therapeutic;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;*Radiosurgery;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",
11152363,Stereotactic radiosurgery for motor cortex region arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVE: The optimal management of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in critical brain locations remains controversial. To reduce the risk of an AVM hemorrhage and to enhance the possibility of preserving neurological function, stereotactic radiosurgery was performed in 33 patients with newly diagnosed or residual AVMs located within the motor cortex. The role of embolization also was examined. METHODS: During a 9-year study period, 33 patients with AVMs located primarily in the motor cortex region were treated with stereotactic radiosurgery. These patients were followed up radiographically for a minimum of 36 months, or less if obliteration was documented before 36 months had elapsed. Of the 33 patients, 9 underwent embolization and 1 underwent microsurgery before radiosurgery. Nine patients required a second radiosurgery. The mean AVM target volume was 4.35 cc, and the average radiation dose to the AVM margin was 20 Gy. The median follow-up was 36 months (range, 10-91 mo), and angiographic follow-up of eligible patients was performed 24 or 36 months after radiosurgery. RESULTS: Results were stratified by radiosurgical target volumes: less than 3 cc (Group 1), 3 to 10 cc (Group 2), and greater than 10 cc (Group 3). Overall (including second radiosurgery), 13 (87%) of 15 patients in Group 1 had complete obliteration confirmed by angiography. Nine (64%) of 14 patients in Group 2 exhibited nidus obliteration, and one (25%) of four patients in Group 3 demonstrated obliteration on a magnetic resonance imaging scan. Eight patients (24%) underwent second-stage radiosurgery after angiography revealed a persistent AVM nidus; three patients demonstrated complete obliteration on follow-up angiography. The obliteration rate was higher (87%) for AVMs with less than 3 cc target volume and lower (56%) for those with target volumes larger than 3 cc. One patient experienced worsening neurological function after radiosurgery, and one died from delayed AVM hemorrhage during the latency period. No patient bled after angiographically confirmed AVM obliteration. CONCLUSION: Stereotactic radiosurgery is a successful and safe management option for patients with motor cortex AVMs. The obliteration of AVMs and the attendant low morbidity rates indicate a primary role for radiosurgery in these patients. Staged radiosurgery may be necessary to increase obliteration rates for larger AVMs or for those that are not obliterated after the first procedure.",2001 Jan,2001,Neurosurgery,48,1,70-6; discussion 76-7,eng,True,10.1097/00006123-200101000-00013,Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use;Cerebral Angiography;Child;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Headache/etiology;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/diagnosis/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Motor Cortex/*blood supply;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects;Seizures/drug therapy/etiology;*Stereotaxic Techniques;Treatment Outcome,
33973037,The Preoperative Functional Downgrading of Brain AVMs.,"The actual role of preoperative embolization of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is undervalued.The present study aims to describe the effectiveness, safety, technics, and results of the endovascular-based functional downgrading of brain AVMs.Data regarding 31 Spetzler-Martin (SM) grade III AVMs that consecutively underwent a combined endovascular-surgical treatment were reviewed. Clinical and radiological outcomes were evaluated according to modified Ranking Scale score (mRS) and postoperative angiography, respectively.Low-density Onyx was used in all cases, and the timeframe between the embolizations was 10-15 days. Procedures were 1.6 (±0.6) on average. Superselective nidal catheterization was essential to reach the deepest parts of the AVMs, which were the targets. Onyx made the nidus compact and easier to dissect. The Average obliteration rate was 29.6%, with negligible morbidity. Surgery was performed after 3.7 days on average and the AVM exclusion was complete in 83.4% of cases. An mRS score between 0 and 2 was reported in 77.5% of patients, while the best outcome was achieved in small and medium-deep malformations.An effective and safe functional downgrading of brain AVMs must be based upon specific technical key aspects, which make surgery easier and, ultimately, allow for the achievement of the best outcome.",2021,2021,Acta neurochirurgica.

METHODS: We reviewed outcomes after AVM radiosurgery for 243 patients from 1990 and 2001. The mean follow-up after radiosurgery was 65 months. RESULTS: Forty-one patients (17%) sustained a decline in MRS (median -2) after AVM radiosurgery. We noted a decline in MRS in 4% of patients 1 year after radiosurgery, 8% of patients at 3 years after radiosurgery, and 15% of patients at 7 years after radiosurgery. The radiosurgery-based AVM score correlated with a decline in MRS after AVM radiosurgery in multivariate testing (odds ratio 2.1; 95% CI 1.2 to 3.6; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Previous AVM rupture did not influence neurologic deterioration after AVM radiosurgery.

36089272,Outcomes of Unruptured Low-Grade Brain Arteriovenous Malformations Using TOBAS (Treatment of Brain Arteriovenous Malformations Study) Criteria.,"BACKGROUND: Treatment of an unruptured brain arteriovenous malformation (bAVM) is a matter of debate, especially for low-grade bAVM (Spetzler-Martin grade I and II). The aim is to compare the outcomes of patients with low-grade unruptured bAVM after interventional or medical management in a pragmatic manner. METHODS: Adults with unruptured low-grade bAVM diagnosed between 2006 and 2016 were included. The primary end points were death from all causes and disabling stroke that resulted in a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score >2 at last follow-up. RESULTS: Eighty-four patients presented with an unruptured Spetzler-Martin low-grade bAVM. Among these patients, 55 (65.5%) were treated and 29 (34.5%) were untreated, with no differences regarding clinical and radiologic characteristics. The modality of treatment was embolization in 25.5%, radiosurgery (alone, 30.9%; with embolization, 18.2%), and surgery (alone, 5.5%; with embolization, 20%). The rupture rate was 6.7% person-year in the untreated group; 12.7% (n = 7) of treated and 16.7% (n = 5) of untreated patients achieved the primary evaluation criteria (P = 0.744). Using a Kaplan-Meier curve, the probability of reaching this criterion at 5 years was not different between groups (P = 0.07). Complications resulting in an mRS score >2 at last follow-up occurred in 9.1%, in 80% of cases after embolization. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows no differences between treated and untreated low-grade bAVM. Embolization seems to carry a high risk of complication and should be used with caution. The small number of cases must encourage cautious interpretations especially because of the spontaneous high-rupture rate. One major interest is to investigate center habits in pathology when treatment standards are limited.",2022 Nov,2022,World neurosurgery,167,,e1050-e1061,eng,False,S1878-8750(22)01279-7;10.1016/j.wneu.2022.08.152;S1878-8750(22)01279-7;10.1016/j.wneu.2022.08.152,Journal Article,"Adult;Humans;Treatment Outcome;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic;*Embolization, Therapeutic/methods;*Stroke/surgery;*Nervous System Malformations/surgery;*Radiosurgery/methods;Rupture, Spontaneous/surgery;Brain;Retrospective Studies",ARUBA;Brain arteriovenous malformation;Low-grade;Outcome;TOBAS;Unruptured
28605551,ABC/2 Method Does not Accurately Predict Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformation Volume.,"BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a treatment option for cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) to prevent intracranial hemorrhage. The decision to proceed with SRS is usually based on calculated nidal volume. Physicians commonly use the ABC/2 formula, based on digital subtraction angiography (DSA), when counseling patients for SRS. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether AVM volume calculated using the ABC/2 method on DSA is accurate when compared to the exact volume calculated from thin-cut axial sections used for SRS planning. METHODS: Retrospective search of neurovascular database to identify AVMs treated with SRS from 1995 to 2015. Maximum nidal diameters in orthogonal planes on DSA images were recorded to determine volume using ABC/2 formula. Nidal target volume was extracted from operative reports of SRS. Volumes were then compared using descriptive statistics and paired t-tests. RESULTS: Ninety intracranial AVMs were identified. Median volume was 4.96 cm3 [interquartile range (IQR) 1.79-8.85] with SRS planning methods and 6.07 cm3 (IQR 1.3-13.6) with ABC/2 methodology. Moderate correlation was seen between SRS and ABC/2 (r = 0.662; P < .001). Paired sample t-tests revealed significant differences between SRS volume and ABC/2 (t = -3.2; P = .002). When AVMs were dichotomized based on ABC/2 volume, significant differences remained (t = 3.1, P = .003 for ABC/2 volume < 7 cm3; t = -4.4, P < .001 for ABC/2 volume > 7 cm3). CONCLUSION: The ABC/2 method overestimates cerebral AVM volume when compared to volumetric analysis from SRS planning software. For AVMs > 7 cm3, the overestimation is even greater. SRS planning techniques were also significantly different than values derived from equations for cones and cylinders.",2018 Feb 1,2018,Neurosurgery,82,2,220-225,eng,False,10.1093/neuros/nyx139;3866413;10.1093/neuros/nyx139,Journal Article,"Adult;Angiography, Digital Subtraction/*methods;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnostic imaging/*pathology/surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/*methods;Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted/*methods;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome",ABC/2 method;AVM volume;Arteriovenous malformation;Cerebral AVM;Planimetric

26658441,Radiosurgery for Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformations in A Randomized Trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformations (ARUBA)-Eligible Patients: A Multicenter Study.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The benefit of intervention for patients with unruptured cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) was challenged by results demonstrating superior clinical outcomes with conservative management from A Randomized Trial of Unruptured Brain AVMs (ARUBA). The aim of this multicenter, retrospective cohort study is to analyze the outcomes of stereotactic radiosurgery for ARUBA-eligible patients. METHODS: We combined AVM radiosurgery outcome data from 7 institutions participating in the International Gamma Knife Research Foundation. Patients with ≥12 months of follow-up were screened for ARUBA eligibility criteria. Favorable outcome was defined as AVM obliteration, no postradiosurgery hemorrhage, and no permanently symptomatic radiation-induced changes. Adverse neurological outcome was defined as any new or worsening neurological symptoms or death. RESULTS: The ARUBA-eligible cohort comprised 509 patients (mean age, 40 years). The Spetzler-Martin grade was I to II in 46% and III to IV in 54%. The mean radiosurgical margin dose was 22 Gy and follow-up was 86 months. AVM obliteration was achieved in 75%. The postradiosurgery hemorrhage rate during the latency period was 0.9% per year. Symptomatic and permanent radiation-induced changes occurred in 11% and 3%, respectively. The rates of favorable outcome, adverse neurological outcome, permanent neurological morbidity, and mortality were 70%, 13%, 5%, and 4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Radiosurgery may provide durable clinical benefit in some ARUBA-eligible patients. On the basis of the natural history of untreated, unruptured AVMs in the medical arm of ARUBA, we estimate that a follow-up duration of 15 to 20 years is necessary to realize a potential benefit of radiosurgical intervention for conservative management in unruptured patients with AVM.",2016 Feb,2016,Stroke,47,2,342-9,eng,True,10.1161/STROKEAHA.115.011400;STROKEAHA.115.011400;10.1161/STROKEAHA.115.011400,Journal Article;Multicenter Study,Adult;Cohort Studies;Eligibility Determination;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Postoperative Complications/epidemiology;Postoperative Hemorrhage/*epidemiology;Radiosurgery/*methods;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome,intracranial arteriovenous malformation;intracranial hemorrhages;radiosurgery;stroke;vascular malformations
36272182,Impact of ARUBA trial on trends and outcomes in symptomatic non-ruptured brain AVMs: A national sample analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: The real-world evolution of management and outcomes of patients with unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) has not been well-delineated following the ARUBA trial findings of no general advantage of initial interventional (surgical/endovascular/radiotherapy) vs. initial conservative medical therapy. METHODS: We analyzed the National Inpatient Sample from 2009-2018, capturing 20% of all admissions in the U.S. Validated ICD-9 and -10 codes defined brain AVMs, comorbidities, and the use of interventional modalities. Analyses were performed by year and for the dichotomized periods of pre-ARUBA (2009-2013) vs. post-ARUBA (2014-2018). RESULTS: Among the national projected 88,037 AVM admissions, 72,812 (82.7%) were unruptured AVMs and 15,225 (17.3%) were ruptured AVMs. Among uAVMs, 51.4% admitted pre-ARUBA and 48.6% in post-ARUBA period. The post-ARUBA patients were mildly older (median age 53.3 vs. 51.8 (p = 0.001) and had more comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, obesity, renal impairment, and smoking. Before the first platform report of ARUBA (2009-2012), rates of use of interventional treatments during uAVM admissions trended up from 31.8% to 35.4%. Thereafter, they declined significantly to 26.4% in 2018 (p = 0.02). The decline was driven by a reduction in the frequency of endovascular treatment from 18.8% to 13.9% and inpatient stereotactic radiosurgery from 0.5% to 0.1%. No change occurred in the frequency of microsurgery or combined endovascular and surgical approaches. Adjusted multivariable model of uAVMs showed increased odds of discharge to a long-term inpatient facility or in-hospital death [OR 1.14 (1.02-1.28), p = 0.020] in post-ARUBA. A significantly increased proportion of ruptured AVMs from 17.0% to 23.3% was observed consistently in post-ARUBA. CONCLUSION: Nationwide practice in the management of unruptured AVMs changed substantially with the publication of the ARUBA trial in a durable and increasing manner. Fewer admissions with the interventional treatment of unruptured AVMs occurred, and a corresponding increase in admission for ruptured AVMs transpired, as expected with a strategy of watchful waiting and treatment only after an index bleeding event. Further studies are needed to determine whether these trends can be considered to be ARUBA trial effect or are merely coincidental.",2022 Dec,2022,Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National,31,12,106807,eng,False,S1052-3057(22)00501-8;10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2022.106807;S1052-3057(22)00501-8;10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2022.106807,Journal Article,Humans;Middle Aged;Brain;Hospital Mortality;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/epidemiology/therapy;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;Clinical Trials as Topic,ARUBA impact;Brain arteriovenous malformation;Embolization;Ischemic stroke;Microsurgical resection;Ruptured AVM;Stereotactic radiosurgery;Subarachnoid hemorrhage
15465204,Stereotactic irradiation for intracranial arteriovenous malformation using stereotactic radiosurgery or hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy.,"PURPOSE: To investigate the appropriateness of the treatment policy of stereotactic irradiation using both hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT) and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) located in an eloquent region or for large AVMs and using SRS alone for the other AVMs. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Included in this study were 75 AVMs in 72 patients, with a mean follow-up of 52 months. Of the 75 AVMs, 33 were located in eloquent regions or were >2.5 cm in maximal diameter and were given 25-35 Gy (mean, 32.4 Gy) in four daily fractions at a single isocenter if the patient agreed to prolonged wearing of the stereotactic frame for 5 days. The other 42 AVMs were treated with SRS at a dose of 15-25 Gy (mean, 24.1 Gy) at the isocenter. The 75 AVMs were classified according to the Spetzler-Martin grading system; 21, 23, 28, 2, and 1 AVM were Grade I, II, III, IV, V, and VI, respectively. RESULTS: The overall actuarial rate of obliteration was 43% (95% confidence interval [CI], 30-56%) at 3 years, 72% (95% CI, 58-86%) at 5 years, and 78% (95% CI, 63-93%) at 6 years. The actuarial obliteration rate at 5 years was 79% for the 42 AVMs <2.0 cm and 66% for the 33 AVMs >2 cm. The 5- and 6-year actuarial obliteration rate was 61% (95% CI, 39-83%) and 71% (95% CI, 47-95%), respectively, after HSRT and 81% (95% CI, 66-96%) and 81% (95% CI, 66-96%), respectively, after SRS; the difference was not statistically significant. Radiation-induced necrosis was observed in 4 subjects in the SRS group and 1 subject in the HSRT group. Cyst formation occurred in 3 patients in the SRS group and no patient in the HSRT group. A permanent symptomatic complication was observed in 3 cases (4.2%), and 1 of the 3 was fatal. All 3 patients were in the SRS group. The annual intracranial hemorrhage rate was 5.5-5.6% for all patients. CONCLUSION: Our treatment policy using SRS and HSRT was as effective as the policy involving SRS alone. The HSRT schedule was suggested to have a lower frequency of radiation necrosis and cyst formation than the high-dose SRS schedule. The benefit of HSRT compared with lower dose SRS has not yet been determined.",2004 Nov 1,2004,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",60,3,861-70,eng,True,S0360301604006790;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2004.04.041,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Analysis of Variance;Confidence Intervals;Dose Fractionation, Radiation;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/mortality/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects",

METHODS AND MATERIALS: This analysis is based on 65 patients. AVM classification according to Spetzler-Martin was 13 patients Grade 2, 39 Grade 3, 12 Grade 4, and 1 Grade 5. Median RS-based AVM score was 1.69. Median single dose was 18 Gy. Mean treatment volume was 5.2 cc (range, 0.2-26.5 cc). Forty patients (62%) experienced intracranial hemorrhage before RS. Median follow-up was 3.0 years. RESULTS: Actuarial complete obliteration rate (CO) was 50% and 65% after 3 and 5 years, respectively. CO was significantly higher in AVM <3 cm (p < 0.02) and after doses >18 Gy (p < 0.009). Annual bleeding risk after RS was 4.7%, 3.4%, and 2.7% after 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. AVM >3 cm (p < 0.01), AVM volume >4 cc (p < 0.009), and AVM score >1.5 (p < 0.02) showed a significant higher bleeding risk. Neurologic dysfunction improved, completely dissolved, or remained stable in 94% of patients.

We present a new case and a systematic literature review to determine possible mechanisms underlying this unusual phenomenon. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: One patient with a brain AVM was referred for radiosurgical treatment. Shortly before treatment however, complete spontaneous regression occurred. This patient had experienced a hemorrhage in the months before referral. RESULTS: We found 38 articles in which 67 cases of complete and spontaneous regression of a brain AVM were presented. Male to female ratio was 1.2, with a mean age of 37 years (range 1-81). Regression occurred in 72% without new neurological events. Median size of the nidus was 2 cm (range 1-7).

37026338,Volume Fractionation Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Large Volume Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations.,"Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are common intracranial vascular anomalies. Common treatment modalities used to manage AVMs are surgical excision, embolization, and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Large AVMs are defined as AVMs larger than 10 cm(3) and pose a therapeutic challenge with high rates of treatment-related morbidity and mortality. Single-stage SRS is a good option for small AVMs but carries high risks of radiation-induced complications in large AVMs. Volume-staged SRS (VS-SRS) is a newer strategy used in large AVMs that allows one to deliver an optimal radiation dose to the AVMs while reducing the risk of radiation damage to the normal brain. It involves the division of AVM into multiple small sectors which are irradiated at different time intervals with high radiation doses. Good obliteration rates with less risk of radiation-induced complications have been described in the literature with VS-SRS.",2023 Mar-Apr,2023,Neurology India,71,Supplement,S82-S89,eng,False,10.4103/0028-3886.373641;ni_2023_71_7_82_373641;10.4103/0028-3886.373641,Journal Article,Humans;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects;Treatment Outcome;Retrospective Studies;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/radiotherapy/surgery;Brain;*Radiation Injuries/surgery;Follow-Up Studies,AVM;Arteriovenous malformation;SRS;gamma knife;volume-fractionated

DESIGN: A nationwide, retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). PARTICIPANTS: An observational study of 1515 patients who were diagnosed with brain AVMs between 1997 and 2013 from the Taiwan NHIRD. PRIMARY OUTCOME AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: We performed a survival analysis using the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to explore the relationship between treatment modalities (GKS vs non-GKS) and haemorrhage, adjusted for age and sex. RESULTS: The GKS and non-GKS groups included 317 and 1198 patients, respectively. Patients in the GKS group (mean±SD, 33.08±15.48 years of age) tended to be younger than those in the non-GKS group (37.40±17.62) (p<0.001). The 15-year follow-up revealed that the rate of bleeding risk was lower in the GKS group than in the non-GKRS group (adjusted HR (aHR) 0.61; 95% CI 0.40 to 0.92). The bleeding risk of ruptured AVMs was significantly lower in GKS group than in the non-GKS group (aHR 0.34; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.62). On the other hand, the bleeding risk of unruptured AVMs was higher in the GKS group than in the non-GKS group (aHR 1.95; 95% CI 1.04 to 3.65). In the unruptured AVM group, the incidence of bleeding was significantly higher among patients in the GKS group that were of >40 years of age (aHR 3.21; 95% CI 1.12 to 9.14). CONCLUSIONS: GKS is safe and it reduces the risk of haemorrhage in patients with ruptured AVMs. The administration of GKS to patients with unruptured AVMs who are above the age of 40 years old male might increase the risk of haemorrhage.",2020 Oct 13,2020,BMJ open,10,10,e036606,eng,False,10.1136/bmjopen-2019-036606;e036606;bmjopen-2019-036606;10.1136/bmjopen-2019-036606,"Journal Article;Observational Study;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Adult;Brain;Cohort Studies;Follow-Up Studies;Hemorrhage;Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/epidemiology/surgery;Male;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects;Retrospective Studies;Taiwan/epidemiology;Treatment Outcome,neurosurgery;stroke;stroke medicine
26276468,Brain arteriovenous malformations in elderly patients: clinical features and treatment outcome.,"BACKGROUND: In this aging society, attention has not been fully given to brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in elderly patients. This study sought to describe a single institution's experience treating arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in elderly patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of brain AVMs in elderly patients treated at our institution between 1990 and 2012 with a focus on the clinical features, risk of hemorrhage and treatment outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 2790 patients in our AVM database, 98 patients were over the age of 60 at presentation. Forty-eight percent presented with hemorrhage. Risks of initial hemorrhage were history of hypertension, smaller AVM size (<3 cm) and exclusively deep venous drainage. Treatment modalities were microsurgical resection in 65 %, embolization alone in 10 %, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in 11 % and observation in 14 %. Preoperative embolization was performed in 32 % in the surgical group. Complete obliteration was achieved in 95 % by microsurgery, 30 % by embolization alone and 45 % by SRS. Good functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale, mRS <2) was achieved in 69 % after a median follow-up of 5.8 years. Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that a pretreatment mRS score ≥2, eloquent location and higher S-M grade (IV or V) were associated with worsening functional status, whereas surgical resection was a negative factor. Posttreatment hemorrhage occurred in 8 %. AVM-related death occurred in three patients (2 by surgery and 1 by observation). CONCLUSIONS: Brain AVMs in elderly patients still pose a high risk of hemorrhage. Initial hemorrhage may be associated with a history of hypertension, AVM size and exclusively deep venous drainage. Initial mRS score ≥2, eloquent location and higher S-M grade may be associated with worsening functional status. Microsurgical resection can be safe and effective for selected patients. Preoperative embolization is helpful in patients with S-M grade IV-V AVMs. For those with surgical contraindications, SRS and observation are treatment alternatives.",2015 Oct,2015,Acta neurochirurgica,157,10,1645-53; discussion 1653-4,eng,False,10.1007/s00701-015-2521-6;10.1007/s00701-015-2521-6;10.1007/s00701-015-2521-6,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Aged;Embolization, Therapeutic/*adverse effects;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/pathology/*surgery;Intracranial Hemorrhages/*etiology;Male;Microsurgery/*adverse effects;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects",Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs);Clinical features;Management;Patients over 60
26186966,Embolization of cerebral arteriovenous malformations with silk suture particles prior to stereotactic radiosurgery.,"We aimed to determine the long term durability of silk suture and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particle embolization (SPE) of arteriovenous malformations (AVM), and to evaluate the outcomes following multimodality management of AVM with combined SPE and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). A general supposition among neurointerventionalists is that embolization of cerebral AVM with silk sutures and PVA particles does not yield a durable occlusion. We performed a retrospective review of all AVM patients treated at our institution with combined SPE and SRS. After extracting the baseline, embolization and SRS data for each patient, the durability of SPE was determined by evaluating the postembolization recanalization between the last procedural angiogram and the most recent neuroimaging. Four AVM patients who underwent a total of nine SPE procedures through 21 arterial pedicles were included for the analyses. The nidus volumes were 5.8-75 cm(3) and the Spetzler-Martin grades were II and V in one patient and III in two patients. The median degree of devascularization per procedure was <25%. There were no procedural complications, with all patients maintaining functional independence after embolization (modified Rankin scale score 0-2). After a median follow-up duration of 27 months (range: 23-36), there were no patients with recanalization. SRS (marginal dose 13-18 Gy) resulted in 40 to >95% volume reduction. Following SRS, one patient remained asymptomatic, two patients improved, and one patient deteriorated due to a latency period AVM hemorrhage. In conclusion, SPE can safely provide durable AVM devascularization, therefore, appropriately selected nidi can be effectively treated with combined SPE and SRS.",2015 Oct,2015,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society,22,10,1643-9,eng,False,S0967-5868(15)00243-X;10.1016/j.jocn.2015.03.046;S0967-5868(15)00243-X;10.1016/j.jocn.2015.03.046,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Cerebral Angiography;Chemoembolization, Therapeutic/methods;Child;Embolization, Therapeutic/*methods;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/surgery/*therapy;Male;Middle Aged;Polyvinyl Alcohol/*therapeutic use;*Radiosurgery/methods;Retrospective Studies;Sclerosing Solutions/*therapeutic use;*Silk;Sutures;Treatment Outcome",Embolization;Gamma knife;Intracranial arteriovenous malformations;Particles;Radiosurgery;Silk;Stroke
21047692,The accuracy of frameless stereotactic intracranial radiosurgery.,"PURPOSE: To determine the accuracy of frameless stereotactic radiosurgery using the BrainLAB ExacTrac system and robotic couch by measuring the individual contributions such as the accuracy of the imaging and couch correction system, the linkage between this system and the linac isocenter and the possible intrafraction motion of the patient in the frameless mask. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An Alderson head phantom with hidden marker was randomly positioned 31 times. Automated 6D couch shifts were performed according to ExacTrac and the deviation with respect to the linac isocenter was measured using the hidden marker. ExacTrac-based set-up was performed for 46 patients undergoing hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for 135 fractions, followed by verification X-rays. Forty-three of these patients received post-treatment X-ray verification for 79 fractions to determine the intrafraction motion. RESULTS: The hidden target test revealed a systematic error of 1.5 mm in one direction, which was corrected after replacement of the system calibration phantom. The accuracy of the ExacTrac positioning is approximately 0.3 mm in each direction, 1 standard deviation. The intrafraction motion was 0.35±0.21 mm, maximum 1.15 mm. CONCLUSION: Intrafraction motion in the BrainLAB frameless mask is very small.

METHOD: Data concerning 90 consecutive patients were retrospectively studied. Clinical, radiological, dosimetrical data and quality indexes were computed. RESULTS: AVM median volume was 1.06cc. Median prescribed dose was 22Gy. Total occlusion was obtained for 69% of patients. Post-radiosurgery annual hemorrhage rate was 2.2%. Predictive factor for total occlusion was delivered dose. Undesirable events occurred for 28% of patients. Predictive factors for adverse events were AVM revealing mode with seizure or headache, age≤28, AVM diameter≥3cm Spetzler-Martin score≥4, V12Gy≥2cc, large target volume and low homogeneity index (p<0.05). Brain parenchymal radiological reactions concerned 23% of patients, and their predictive factors were AVM revelation by seizure, deep localization, AVM diameter≥3cm, Spetzler-Martin score≥4, previous radiosurgery, numerous embolization, target volume, V12Gy and low homogeneity index (p<0.05).

19392591,Clinical and radiobiological advantages of single-dose stereotactic light-ion radiation therapy for large intracranial arteriovenous malformations. Technical note.,"OBJECT: Radiation treatment of large arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) remains difficult and not very effective, even though seemingly promising methods such as staged volume treatments have been proposed by some radiation treatment centers. In symptomatic patients harboring large intracranial AVMs not amenable to embolization or resection, single-session high-dose stereotactic radiation therapy is a viable option, and the special characteristics of high-ionization-density light-ion beams offer several treatment advantages over photon and proton beams. These advantages include a more favorable depth-dose distribution in tissue, an almost negligible lateral scatter of the beam, a sharper penumbra, a steep dose falloff beyond the Bragg peak, and a higher probability of vascular response due to high ionization density and associated induction of endothelial cell proliferation and/or apoptosis. Carbon ions were recently shown to be an effective treatment for skull-base tumors. Bearing that in mind, the authors postulate that the unique physical and biological characteristics of light-ion beams should convey considerable clinical advantages in the treatment of large AVMs. In the present meta-analysis the authors present a comparison between light-ion beam therapy and more conventional modalities of radiation treatment with respect to these lesions. METHODS: Dose-volume histograms and data on peripheral radiation doses for treatment of large AVMs were collected from various radiation treatment centers. Dose-response parameters were then derived by applying a maximum likelihood fitting of a binomial model to these data. The present binomial model was needed because the effective number of crucial blood vessels in AVMs (the number of vessels that must be obliterated to effect a cure, such as large fistulous nidus vessels) is low, making the Poisson model less suitable. In this study the authors also focused on radiobiological differences between various radiation treatments. RESULTS: Light-ion Bragg-peak dose delivery has the precision required for treating very large AVMs as well as for delivering extremely sharp, focused beams to irregular lesions. Stereotactic light-ion radiosurgery resulted in better angiographically defined obliteration rates, less white-matter necrosis, lower complication rates, and more favorable clinical outcomes. In addition, in patients treated by He ion beams, a sharper dose-response gradient was observed, probably due to a more homogeneous radiosensitivity of the AVM nidus to light-ion beam radiation than that seen when low-ionization-density radiation modalities, such as photons and protons, are used. CONCLUSIONS: Bragg-peak radiosurgery can be recommended for most large and irregular AVMs and for the treatment of lesions located in front of or adjacent to sensitive and functionally important brain structures. The unique physical and biological characteristics of light-ion beams are of considerable advantage for the treatment of AVMs: the densely ionizing beams of light ions create a better dose and biological effect distribution than conventional radiation modalities such as photons and protons. Using light ions, greater flexibility can be achieved while avoiding healthy critical structures such as diencephalic and brainstem nuclei and tracts. Treatment with the light ion He or Li is more suitable for AVMs <or= 10 cm(3), whereas treatment with the light ion Li, Be, or C may be more appropriate for larger AVMs. A binomial model based on the effective number of crucial vessels in the AVM may be used quite well to predict AVM obliteration probabilities for both small and large AVMs when therapies involving either photons or light ions are used.",2009 Nov,2009,Journal of neurosurgery,111,5,919-26,eng,False,10.3171/2007.10.17205;10.3171/2007.10.17205,Journal Article;Review,"Algorithms;Cerebral Angiography;Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/pathology/*surgery;Ions;Male;Models, Statistical;Photons;Protons;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects;Vascular Surgical Procedures;Young Adult",
27209571,Relief of epilepsy and headache and quality of life after microsurgical treatment of unruptured brain AVM-audit of a single-center series and comprehensive review of the literature.,"Although the benefit of intervention for unruptured arteriovenous malformation (AVM) with regard to stroke rates and long-term disability remains unclear, most patients present with symptoms, such as epilepsy, headache, or neurological deficits, compromising their quality of life. Detailed analysis of the long-term effects of microsurgical treatment on quality of life, epilepsy, and headache was the purpose of this audit. A series of 25 microsurgically treated patients were interviewed on average 7 ± 5 years after treatment. Detailed information was obtained regarding frequency and severity of seizures and headaches. Outcome data was compared with the initial complaints and neurological findings. The Short Form (SF)-36 was used to assess health-related quality of life. On average, the SF-36 scores did not differ significantly from the age-matched German norm values. Patients suffering from chronic headache prior to treatment scored worse in most SF-36 subscales than patients without headache at the time of treatment, and the difference was significant in the SF-36 dimensions physical role functioning and emotional role functioning (P = 0.04). In contrast, there was a trend for patients treated for incidental AVM to score somewhat better than the age norm. Twelve patients had been admitted with epilepsy. At the time of follow-up, all patients were seizure free (Engel class I), although 7 of them continued to take antiepileptic medication. Two of 13 patients without epilepsy at the time of treatment experienced seizures sometime during the post treatment course and were under medication at the time of long-term follow-up interview. At the time of the audit, 7 of 11 patients admitted with chronic headache necessitating regular use of pain medication indicated not to use pain medication any longer. Our data suggest that initial symptoms leading to diagnosis and treatment of unruptured AVM may influence long-term quality of life following treatment. Patients admitted with headache as the chief complaint appear to fare worse than patients with epileptogenic or incidental AVMs.",2017 Jan,2017,Neurosurgical review,40,1,59-65,eng,False,10.1007/s10143-016-0750-7;10.1007/s10143-016-0750-7;10.1007/s10143-016-0750-7,Journal Article,Adult;Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use;Epilepsy/drug therapy/*etiology;Female;Headache/diagnosis/*etiology;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/*therapy;Male;Microsurgery;Middle Aged;Neurosurgical Procedures;*Quality of Life;Radiosurgery/methods;Time;Treatment Outcome,Epilepsy;Headache;Quality of life;Unruptured cerebral arteriovenous malformation

18377305,Gamma Knife surgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations in children: a 13-year experience.,"OBJECT: Studies on the efficacy of arteriovenous malformation (AVM) radiosurgery have largely been conducted in the adult population. Clinically, the results may not always be applicable to pediatric patients. Moreover, studies involving the pediatric population have largely comprised small- (< 3 cm3) and medium-sized (3-10 cm3) AVMs. For large (> 10 cm3) AVMs in children, sparse radiosurgical results are available. The current study was conducted to further clarify the role of radiosurgery in the treatment of pediatric AVMs. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed of data obtained in 105 pediatric patients (< 18 years of age) with cerebral AVMs treated by Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) between 1993 and 2006. For statistical comparison the authors studied data acquired in 458 adult patients with AVMs treated during the same period. The patients underwent follow-up magnetic resonance imaging at 6-month intervals. Cerebral angiography was used to confirm the obliteration of the AVM. RESULTS: In pediatric patients, the AVM obliteration rate at 48 months after a primary GKS was 65%. Repeated GKS in those in whom primary treatments failed further ablated some AVMs, for an overall obliteration rate of 81%. The efficacy of GKS correlated with the size of the AVM: 91% for small, 86% for medium, and 64% for large AVMs. The treatments were associated with an 8% morbidity rate and < 1% mortality rate. Posttreatment hemorrhage occurred in 4 (4%) of 105 patients. Obliteration rates at 48 months of small and extremely large (> 20 cm3) AVMs were similar in the pediatric and adult groups, whereas AVMs between 3 and 10 cm3 responded less efficaciously in children (p = 0.042). The AVMs with volumes ranging from 10 to 20 cm3 were also associated with a lower obliteration rate in children at 48 months, but statistical significance was not reached (p = 0.279). CONCLUSIONS: Gamma Knife surgery is an effective and safe treatment alternative for pediatric AVMs. The medium (3-10-cm3) and large (10-20-cm3) AVMs tend to respond less efficaciously than those of comparable size in adults.",2008 Apr,2008,Journal of neurosurgery.

26722691,Microsurgical resection of ambient cistern arteriovenous malformation.,"The middle tentorial incisural space, located lateral to the midbrain and medial to the temporal lobe, contains the ambient cistern through which courses the third, fourth, and fifth cranial nerves, posterior cerebral artery (PCA), superior cerebellar artery, and the choroidal arteries.

30595165,Milestones in stereotactic radiosurgery for the central nervous system.,"INTRODUCTION: Since Lars Leksell developed the first stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) device in 1951, there has been growth in the technologies available and clinical indications for SRS. This expansion has been reflected in the medical literature, which is built upon key articles and institutions that have significantly impacted SRS applications. Our aim was to identify these prominent works and provide an educational tool for training and further inquiry. METHOD: A list of search phrases relating to central nervous system applications of stereotactic radiosurgery was compiled. A topic search was performed using PubMed and Scopus databases. The journal, year of publication, authors, treatment technology, clinical subject, study design and level of evidence for each article were documented. Influence was proposed by citation count and rate. RESULTS: Our search identified a total of 10,211 articles with the top 10 publications overall on the study of SRS spanning 443-1313 total citations. Four articles reported on randomized controlled trials, all of which evaluated intracranial metastases. The most prominent subtopics included SRS for arteriovenous malformation, glioblastoma, and acoustic neuroma. Greatest representation by treatment modality included Gamma Knife, LINAC, and TomoTherapy. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic reporting of the influential literature on SRS for intracranial and spinal pathologies underscores the technology's rapid and wide reaching clinical applications. Moreover the findings provide an academic guide to future health practitioners and engineers in their study of SRS for neurosurgery.",2019 Jan,2019,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society,59,,12-19,eng,False,S0967-5868(18)31392-4;10.1016/j.jocn.2018.09.029;S0967-5868(18)31392-4;10.1016/j.jocn.2018.09.029,Journal Article;Review,"Central Nervous System Diseases/*diagnosis/*radiotherapy;Databases, Factual/trends;Glioblastoma/diagnosis/radiotherapy;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/radiotherapy;Neuroma, Acoustic/diagnosis/radiotherapy;Particle Accelerators;Radiosurgery/*methods/*trends;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/methods;Treatment Outcome",Acoustic neuroma;Arteriovenous malformation;Behavioral disorders;Glioblastoma;Intracranial metastases;Meningioma;Stereotactic radiosurgery;Trigeminal neuralgia
39256204,Vein of galen malformations: for patients and caregivers.,"Vein of Galen malformations (VOGMs), also known as Vein of Galen Aneurysmal Malformations (VGAMs), are rare and complex cerebrovascular anomalies that pose significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. These malformations result from abnormal arteriovenous shunts during embryonic development, leading to a range of severe clinical manifestations, including high-output cardiac failure and hydrocephalus. Advances in prenatal imaging, particularly fetal MRI, have improved early detection, allowing for timely intervention. Endovascular techniques, especially transarterial embolization, have become the primary treatment modality, often preferred over surgical approaches due to their effectiveness and lower risk. However, challenges remain, particularly in managing these malformations in neonates and infants, where the risk of complications is high. Gamma Knife radiosurgery offers a non-invasive alternative for select cases, though its effects are gradual and may carry delayed risks. Despite advancements, the management of VOGMs continues to require a multidisciplinary approach, with ongoing research focused on improving outcomes through a better understanding of the genetic and molecular underpinnings of the disease. Future directions include the integration of genetic studies into clinical practice and the refinement of treatment strategies to optimize outcomes for this complex condition.",2024 Sep 11,2024,Neurosurgical review,47,1,587,eng,False,10.1007/s10143-024-02851-w;10.1007/s10143-024-02851-w;10.1007/s10143-024-02851-w,Journal Article;Letter;Review,"Humans;*Vein of Galen Malformations/surgery/complications;Embolization, Therapeutic/methods;Radiosurgery/methods;Endovascular Procedures/methods;Infant, Newborn",Galen;Gamma Knife;Malformations;Radiosurgery;Vein
26549679,Endovascular treatment of posterior fossa arteriovenous malformations.,"Infratentorial arteriovenous malformations (AVM) are rare, representing only 7-15% of cerebral AVM. The concentration of eloquent neurological structures and the high rate of bleeding presentation of AVM in this location complicate the management of such lesions. New therapeutic options, especially in endovascular therapy, have fundamentally modified the treatment strategy and also the outcome of posterior fossa AVM. Between 1999 and 2013, baseline, clinical and angiographic data of cerebral AVM were prospectively collected. We analyzed data from patients treated for a posterior fossa AVM, focusing on risk factors for bleeding, and clinical and angiographic outcomes. Sixty-nine patients (mean age 34 years, male to female ratio 2:1) were consecutively treated for an infratentorial AVM. Fifty-seven presented with hemorrhage, six with focal neurologic deficits, and the remaining six patients were diagnosed incidentally. The Spetzler-Martin grade was < 3 in 39 (56.5%) patients. Associated aneurysms were noted in 43.5% of patients. All patients were treated using endovascular procedures, associated with microsurgical resection in nine patients and with stereotactic radiosurgery in six. Mean follow-up was 28.5 months, with angiographic exclusion of the AVM in 72.5% of patients; 21.7% of patients presented a modified Rankin Score ⩾ 3 at follow-up. Endovascular embolization seems to be a secure approach for posterior fossa AVM although a large number of sessions are necessary to achieve complete obliteration.

24686048,Integration of magnetoencephalography-generated functional brain maps into dose planning during arteriovenous malformation radiosurgery.,"BACKGROUND: Magnetoencephalography (MEG) can delineate critical regions of the cortex and facilitate conformal stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) dose planning. Despite the substantial role of Gamma Knife® SRS in arteriovenous malformation (AVM) management, MEG-generated maps of critical regions have never been utilized to improve dose planning. PURPOSE: To assess the value of integrating functional brain mapping using MEG with dose planning during treatment of brain AVMs with SRS. METHODS: This case series encompassed 5 patients with motor region AVMs. Noninvasive eloquent cortex mapping was achieved using a whole-head 306-channel Neuromag® Vectorview MEG System 5-10 days before SRS. On the day of SRS, the functional brain maps were integrated onto the intraoperative dose planning magnetic resonance imaging for Leksell GammaPlan® version 10. The median AVM volume treated was 12.7 cm(3), and 18 Gy was the median margin dose. RESULTS: Functional image integration of MEG improved the recognition of critical brain structures adjacent to the AVM. This facilitated anatomical planning designed to reduce the dose to adjacent critical structures while maintaining a therapeutic dose to the AVM target. The 5 patients had no adverse radiation effects during the follow-up.

30002149,Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Pediatric Versus Adult Brain Arteriovenous Malformations.,"Background and Purpose- The aim of this international, multicenter, retrospective matched cohort study is to directly compare the outcomes after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for brain arteriovenous malformations (AVM) in pediatric versus adult patients. Methods- We performed a retrospective review of patients with AVM who underwent SRS at 8 institutions participating in the International Gamma Knife Research Foundation from 1987 to 2014. Patients were categorized into pediatric (<18 years of age) and adult (≥18 years of age) cohorts and matched in a 1:1 ratio using propensity scores. Favorable outcome was defined as AVM obliteration, no post-SRS hemorrhage, and no permanently symptomatic radiation-induced changes. Results- From a total of 2191 patients who were eligible for inclusion in the overall study cohort, 315 were selected for each of the matched cohorts. There were no significant differences between matched pediatric versus adult cohorts with respect to the rates of favorable outcome (59% versus 58%; P=0.936), AVM obliteration (62% versus 63%; P=0.934), post-SRS hemorrhage (9% versus 7%; P=0.298), radiological radiation-induced changes (26% versus 26%; P=0.837), symptomatic radiation-induced changes (7% versus 9%; P=0.383), or permanent radiation-induced changes (2% versus 3%; P=0.589). The all-cause mortality rate was significantly lower in the matched pediatric cohort (3% versus 10%; P=0.003). Conclusions- The outcomes after SRS for comparable AVMs in pediatric versus adult patients were not found to be appreciably different.

15214994,The relationship between occlusive hyperemia and complications associated with the radiosurgical treatment of arteriovenous malformations: report of two cases.,"OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: It has been suggested that impaired venous drainage of normal brain after surgical removal of an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) may cause perinidal edema and hemorrhage. The term occlusive hyperemia has been proposed for this phenomenon. There is evidence that occlusive hyperemia also may occur after radiosurgical treatment of AVMs. The purpose of this article is to lend further support to the concept that venous occlusion may be responsible for some complications observed after AVM radiosurgery. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: We report two patients with unusual radiosurgery-associated complications, and we examine the evidence for venous occlusion as the mechanism underlying the observed clinical sequelae in each patient. INTERVENTION: Patient 1 had a large parietal venous infarct remote from her frontal AVM site 11 months after radiosurgery. At that time, the AVM was confirmed by angiography to have been obliterated. During the next 4 years, the patient experienced persistent posterior hemispheric edema with recurrent focal hemorrhages until the patient's death from massive swelling and uncal herniation. During this period, radiographic studies, including repeat angiography, demonstrated sequential cortical venous occlusions and findings most consistent with venous insufficiency. Postmortem examination revealed no evidence of radionecrosis. Patient 2 exhibited a biphasic pattern of neurological deterioration at 3 and 6 years after radiosurgery. Associated with this unusual phenomenon, there was radiographic evidence of venous outflow obstruction of her thalamic AVM with prominent perinidal edema and progressive occlusion of the nidus. CONCLUSION: We conclude that occlusive hyperemia is responsible for some cases of neurological deterioration after AVM radiosurgery, especially in a setting for which the time course or other clinical features are not as might be expected from a radiobiological perspective. The two patients we describe in this report suggest that manifestations may vary.",2004 Jul,2004,Neurosurgery,55,1,228-33; discussion 233-4,eng,False,10.1227/01.neu.0000126950.67029.f8,"Case Reports;Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Adult;Brain/*blood supply;Cerebral Veins/radiation effects;Female;Humans;Hyperemia/*etiology;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects;Venous Insufficiency/*etiology,

15001262,Integration of functional brain information into stereotactic irradiation treatment planning using magnetoencephalography and magnetic resonance axonography.,"PURPOSE: To minimize the risk of neurologic deficit after stereotactic irradiation, functional brain information was integrated into treatment planning. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-one magnetoencephalography and six magnetic resonance axonographic images were made in 20 patients to evaluate the sensorimotor cortex (n = 15 patients, including the corticospinal tract in 6), visual cortex (n = 4), and Wernicke's area (n = 2). One radiation oncologist was asked to formulate a treatment plan first without the functional images and then to modify the plan after seeing them. The pre- and postmodification values were compared for the volume of the functional area receiving > or =15 Gy and the volume of the planning target volume receiving > or =80% of the prescribed dose. RESULTS: Of the 21 plans, 15 (71%) were modified after seeing the functional images. After modification, the volume receiving > or =15 Gy was significantly reduced compared with the values before modification in those 15 sets of plans (p = 0.03). No statistically significant difference was found in the volume of the planning target volume receiving > or =80% of the prescribed dose (p = 0.99). During follow-up, radiation-induced necrosis at the corticospinal tract caused a minor motor deficit in 1 patient for whom magnetic resonance axonography was not available in the treatment planning. No radiation-induced functional deficit was observed in the other patients. CONCLUSION: Integration of magnetoencephalography and magnetic resonance axonography in treatment planning has the potential to reduce the risk of radiation-induced functional dysfunction without deterioration of the dose distribution in the target volume.",2004 Mar 15,2004,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",58,4,1177-83,eng,False,S0360301603019333;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2003.08.034,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Brain/radiation effects;Brain Neoplasms/physiopathology/secondary/*surgery;Cerebral Cortex/*anatomy & histology/physiology;Child;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/psychology/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods;Magnetoencephalography/*methods;Middle Aged;Pyramidal Tracts/*anatomy & histology/physiology;Radiosurgery/adverse effects/*methods;Radiotherapy Dosage",
14580269,Hypofractionated conformal stereotactic radiotherapy for arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVE: Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are congenital vascular lesions that are associated with high morbidity and mortality if left untreated. There are several options for treatment, including radiotherapy. Safe and effective single-fraction radiotherapy for patients with large AVMs has been considered difficult. METHODS: Between December 1986 and June 2001, 36 patients with cerebral AVMs were treated with hypofractionated conformal stereotactic radiotherapy at Umeå University Hospital. Twenty-nine patients have been followed angiographically to date and are reported in this study. RESULTS: Twenty-four (83%) of 29 patients (mean AVM volume, 11.5 cm(3)) underwent complete obliteration of their AVMs. The rates of angiographically verified total obliteration at 2 years after treatment were 56% for AVMs 4 to 10 cm(3) and 50% for AVMs larger than 10 cm(3). The obliteration rate increased considerably with extended follow-up. Five years after treatment, the obliteration rates were 81% for AVMs 4 to 10 cm(3) and 70% for AVMs larger than 10 cm(3). CONCLUSION: Hypofractionated conformal stereotactic radiotherapy may be an important alternative to single-fraction radiotherapy in patients with large AVMs or AVMs located in eloquent areas, because it allows the administration of a higher radiation dose than is possible to deliver in single-fraction radiosurgery. With our technique of hypofractionated conformal stereotactic radiotherapy, the rate of obliterating AVMs was comparable to that of single-dose radiosurgery, although the volumes of the irradiated AVMs in our study were larger than those reported previously.",2003 Nov,2003,Neurosurgery,53,5,1036-42; discussion 1042-3,eng,False,10.1227/01.neu.0000088566.82699.e6,Evaluation Study;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Cerebral Angiography;*Dose Fractionation, Radiation;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Necrosis;Radiation Injuries/*etiology;Radiosurgery/adverse effects/*methods;Radiotherapy, Conformal/adverse effects/*methods;Severity of Illness Index;Treatment Outcome",
27911249,International multicenter cohort study of pediatric brain arteriovenous malformations. Part 2: Outcomes after stereotactic radiosurgery.,"OBJECTIVE Pediatric patients (age < 18 years) harboring brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are burdened with a considerably higher cumulative lifetime risk of hemorrhage than adults. Additionally, the pediatric population was excluded from recent prospective comparisons of intervention versus conservative management for unruptured AVMs. The aims of this multicenter, retrospective cohort study are to analyze the outcomes after stereotactic radiosurgery for unruptured and ruptured pediatric AVMs. METHODS We analyzed and pooled AVM radiosurgery data from 7 participating in the International Gamma Knife Research Foundation. Patients younger than 18 years of age who had at least 12 months of follow-up were included in the study cohort. Favorable outcome was defined as AVM obliteration, no post-radiosurgical hemorrhage, and no permanently symptomatic radiation-induced changes (RIC). The post-radiosurgery outcomes of unruptured versus ruptured pediatric AVMs were compared, and statistical analyses were performed to identify predictive factors. RESULTS The overall pediatric AVM cohort comprised 357 patients with a mean age of 12.6 years (range 2.8-17.9 years). AVMs were previously treated with embolization, resection, and fractionated external beam radiation therapy in 22%, 6%, and 13% of patients, respectively. The mean nidus volume was 3.5 cm(3), 77% of AVMs were located in eloquent brain areas, and the Spetzler-Martin grade was III or higher in 59%. The mean radiosurgical margin dose was 21 Gy (range 5-35 Gy), and the mean follow-up was 92 months (range 12-266 months). AVM obliteration was achieved in 63%. During a cumulative latency period of 2748 years, the annual post-radiosurgery hemorrhage rate was 1.4%. Symptomatic and permanent radiation-induced changes occurred in 8% and 3%, respectively. Favorable outcome was achieved in 59%. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the absence of prior AVM embolization (p = 0.001) and higher margin dose (p < 0.001) were found to be independent predictors of a favorable outcome. The rates of favorable outcome for patients treated with a margin dose ≥ 22 Gy vs < 22 Gy were 78% (110/141 patients) and 47% (101/216 patients), respectively. A margin dose ≥ 22 Gy yielded a significantly higher probability of a favorable outcome (p < 0.001). The unruptured and ruptured pediatric AVM cohorts included 112 and 245 patients, respectively. Ruptured AVMs had significantly higher rates of obliteration (68% vs 53%, p = 0.005) and favorable outcome (63% vs 51%, p = 0.033), with a trend toward a higher incidence of post-radiosurgery hemorrhage (10% vs 4%, p = 0.07). The annual post-radiosurgery hemorrhage rates were 0.8% for unruptured and 1.6% for ruptured AVMs. CONCLUSIONS Radiosurgery is a reasonable treatment option for pediatric AVMs. Obliteration and favorable outcomes are achieved in the majority of patients. The annual rate of latency period hemorrhage after radiosurgery for both ruptured and unruptured pediatric AVM patients conveys a significant risk until the nidus is obliterated.",2017 Feb,2017,Journal of neurosurgery.

18450230,Evaluation of pediatric patients with vascular malformations managed with endovascular and radiosurgical techniques using a modified Rankin Disability Scale.,"BACKGROUND: Pre- and postoperative evaluation of the pediatric patient with a cerebrovascular malformation can be cumbersome. This may be due to several factors, including age and ability to verbalize. Functional evaluation scales have been devised, yet application to a retrospective study, where information can be limited, may not be possible. Simpler scales, serving the purpose of functional description and categorization would be beneficial in these cases. METHODS: Between December 1997 and December 2003, 24 patients between the ages of 4 months to 17 years old underwent endovascular treatment for cerebrovascular lesions at our institution. The majority of the arteriovenous malformation cases underwent further radiosurgical treatment. Mean follow-up period from the time of the last endovascular or radiosurgical intervention was 22 months. A pediatric modification of the Rankin Disability Scale was used for evaluation of pre-procedural and post-procedural functional status. RESULTS: Combined embolization/radiosurgical approach had 4% mortality and 4% morbidity rates. This combined technique achieved a 46% cure in a variety of pediatric vascular anomalies. Overall improvement in disability using the pediatric modification of the Rankin Scale was noted for all of the cases, and a tendency for improvement was noted in the arteriovenous malformation subgroup though not statistically significant, p = 0.0547. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that a pediatric modification of the Rankin Disability Scale can be used for functional evaluation in this population. Although other functional evaluation scales are available and validated, using a Rankin Disability Scale modification is straightforward, and it can provide functional categorization in retrospective studies.",2008 Mar,2008,Puerto Rico health sciences journal,27,1,27-33,eng,False,,"Journal Article;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural","Adolescent;Blood Vessels/*abnormalities;Child;Child, Preschool;*Embolization, Therapeutic;Female;Humans;Infant;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*therapy;Male;Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies",
28294455,Integration of arterial spin labeling into stereotactic radiosurgery planning of cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"PURPOSE: To test whether the combined use of 4D arterial spin labeling angiography (4D ASL) and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (4D CE-MRA) can work as a prospective alternative to digital subtraction angiography (DSA) for the delineation of the arteriovenous malformation (AVM) nidus in stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) planning. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A custom 4D ASL sequence and a proof-of-concept software tool to integrate 4D ASL data to SRS planning were implemented. Ten AVM patients were scanned at 3T. Two observers independently contoured niduses in two separate sessions. Reference niduses were contoured using DSA, 4D ASL, and 4D CE-MRA. Test niduses were contoured using 4D ASL and 4D CE-MRA only. Reference and test niduses from both observers were compared in terms of volume, distance between centers of volumes (dCOV), and the Jaccard index (JI). RESULTS: In volume comparisons, excellent intraobserver and interobserver agreements were obtained (intraclass correlation coefficients: 0.99 and 0.98, respectively). Median dCOV, JIs between reference and test niduses were 0.55 mm, 0.78 for Observer 1 and were 0.6 mm, 0.78 for Observer 2. None of the dCOV and JI parameters varied significantly among the delineation methods or the observers (P = 0.84, P = 0.39). CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results indicate that reproducibility of the target volumes with high agreement levels is achievable without using DSA. The combined use of high temporal resolution 4D ASL and high spatial resolution and vessel-to-background contrast 4D CE-MRA provided sufficient spatiotemporal angiographic information for the delineation of AVM niduses.

37026335,Adverse Radiation Effects Following Gamma Knife Radiosurgery.,"Gamma Knife Radiosurgery (GKRS) is now an established standard of treatment for the small-sized arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), meningiomas, schwannomas, metastasis, and other benign diseases. With an exponential rise in the indications for GKRS, we have witnessed an increase in the adverse radiation effects (ARE) following GKRS. The common AREs and associated risk factors following GKRS have been described for pathologies including vestibular schwannomas, arteriovenous malformations, meningiomas, and metastases based on the authors' experience, and a simplified management protocol has been provided for radiation-induced changes based on clinical and radiologic parameters. The dose, volume, location, and repeat stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) are implied as the risk factors for ARE. Clinically symptomatic AREs require oral steroids for weeks to alleviate symptoms. In refractory cases, bevacizumab and surgical resection can be offered as a treatment modality. Appropriate dose planning strategy and hypofractionation for larger lesions help in mitigating the AREs.",2023 Mar-Apr,2023,Neurology India,71,Supplement,S59-S67,eng,False,10.4103/0028-3886.373645;ni_2023_71_7_59_373645;10.4103/0028-3886.373645,Journal Article;Review,"Humans;*Meningioma/surgery;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects/methods;*Neuroma, Acoustic/surgery;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery;*Meningeal Neoplasms/radiotherapy/surgery/etiology;Treatment Outcome;Retrospective Studies;Follow-Up Studies",Adverse radiation effects;Gamma Knife;radiosurgery

The authors believe that this study is the first to report on patients treated with embolization followed by staged GKS. METHODS: The authors identified 150 patients who underwent GKS for treatment of AVMs between 1994 and 2004. In a retrospective study, 4 independent groups emerged based on the various combinations of treatment: 92 patients who underwent unstaged GKS, 28 patients who underwent embolization followed by unstaged GKS, 23 patients who underwent staged GKS, and 7 patients who underwent embolization followed by staged GKS. A minimum of 3 years of follow-up after the last GKS treatment was required for inclusion in the retrospective analysis. Angiograms, MR images, or CT scans at follow-up were required for calculating rates of obliteration of AVMs. RESULTS: Fifty-seven of 150 patients (38%) supplied angiograms, and overall obliteration was confirmed in 43 of these 57 patients (75.4%). An additional 37 patients had follow-up MR images or CT scans. The overall obliteration rate, including patients with follow-up angiograms and patients with follow-up MR images or CT scans, was 68 of 94 (72.3%). Patients who underwent unstaged GKS had a follow-up rate of 58.7% (54 of 92) and an obliteration rate of 75.9% (41 of 54). Patients who underwent embolization followed by unstaged GKS had a follow-up rate of 53.5% (15 of 28) and an obliteration rate of 60.0% (9 of 15). Patients who underwent staged GKS had a follow-up rate of 82.6% (19 of 23) and an obliteration rate of 73.7% (14 of 19). Patients who underwent embolization followed by staged GKS had a follow-up rate of 85.7% (6 of 7) and an obliteration rate of 66.7% (4 of 6). CONCLUSIONS: Gamma Knife surgery is an effective means of treating AVMs. Embolization prior to GKS may reduce AVM obliteration rates.

METHODS: Data were collected from a prospectively maintained departmental database selected for age and supplemented by case note review and telephone interviews as appropriate. RESULTS: Three hundred sixty-three patients, ages 1-16 years (mean ± SD, 12 ± 3.2 years), underwent 410 treatments; 4 had planned 2-stage treatments and 43 were retreated subsequent to an initial partial response. Fifty-eight percent received general anesthesia for the procedure. Sixteen percent had previously undergone embolization. The most common presenting symptoms were as follows: hemorrhage (80.2%), epilepsy (8.3%; overall seizure prevalence 19.9%), and migrainous headaches (6.3%). Only 0.28% of the AVMs were incidental findings. The mean lesion volume was 3.75 ± 5.3 cm3 (range 0.01-32.8 cm3), with a median Spetzler-Martin grade of III (range I-V). The mean peripheral (therapeutic) dose was 22.7 ± 2.3 Gy (range 15-25 Gy), corresponding to a mean maximum dose of 43.6 ± 6 Gy (range 25-51.4 Gy). The obliteration rate was 71.3% in patients who received one treatment and 62.5% for retreated patients, with a mean obliteration time of 32.4 and 79.6 months, respectively. The overall obliteration rate was 82.7%. No follow-up data are as yet available for the 4 patients who underwent the staged treatments. Only 4 patients received peripheral doses below 20 Gy, and the AVM was obliterated in 3 of these patients. The other patients received 20, 22.5, or 25 Gy and had obliteration rates of 82.6%, 77.7%, and 86.3%, respectively. The bleeding rate postradiosurgery was 2.2%, and the cumulative complication rate was 3.6%, with radionecrosis being the most common complication (1.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Surprisingly, there was no correlation (p = 0.43) between outcome and radiosurgical dose when that dose was between 20 and 25 Gy, thus suggesting that the lower of these 2 doses may be effective.

In the treatment of this patient, we performed radiosurgery therapy alone, rather than a combination.

17804888,Possible fractionated regimens for image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy of large arteriovenous malformations.,"The aim of this study was to estimate a plausible alpha/beta ratio for arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) based on reported clinical data, and to design possible fractionation regimens suitable for image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IG-IMRT) for large AVMs based on the newly obtained alpha/beta ratio. The commonly used obliteration rate (OR) for AVMs with a three year angiographic follow-up from many institutes was fitted to linear-quadratic (LQ) formalism and the Poisson OR model. The determined parameters were then used to calculate possible fractionation regimens for IG-IMRT based on the concept of a biologically effective dose (BED) and an equivalent uniform dose (EUD). The radiobiological analysis yields a alpha/beta ratio of 2.2 +/- 1.6 Gy for AVMs. Three sets of possible fractionated schemes were designed to achieve equal or better biological effectiveness than the single-fraction treatments while maintaining the same probability of normal brain complications. A plausible alpha/beta ratio was derived for AVMs and possible fractionation regimens that may be suitable for IG-IMRT for large AVM treatment are proposed. The sensitivity of parameters on the calculation was also studied. The information may be useful to design new clinical trials that use IG-IMRT for the treatment of large AVMs.",2007 Sep 21,2007,Physics in medicine and biology,52,18,5667-82,eng,False,S0031-9155(07)47117-2;10.1088/0031-9155/52/18/013,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Dose Fractionation, Radiation;Feasibility Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Radiography;Radiosurgery/*methods;Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted/*methods;Radiotherapy, Conformal/*methods;Surgery, Computer-Assisted/*methods",

Instead of accepting the imaging observation as a binary (yes or no) mapping of AVM location, our alternative is to translate the image into an AVM probability distribution map by incorporating imagers' sensitivity and specificity, and to use this map as a basis for planning and evaluation. Three sets of radiosurgery plans, targeting the MRA and DSA positive overlap, MRA positive, and DSA positive were optimized for best conformality. The AVM obliteration rate (ORAVM) and brain complication rate served as endpoints for plan comparison. RESULTS: In our 10-patient study, the specificities and sensitivities of MRA and DSA were estimated to be (0.95, 0.74) and (0.71, 0.95), respectively. The positive overlap of MRA and DSA accounted for 67.8% +/- 4.9% of the estimated true AVM volume. Compared with plans targeting MRA and DSA-positive overlap, plans targeting MRA-positive or DSA-positive improved ORAVM by 4.1% +/- 1.9% and 15.7% +/- 8.3%, while also increasing the complication rate by 1.0% +/- 0.8% and 4.4% +/- 2.3%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of imagers' quality should be quantified and incorporated in AVM radiosurgery planning and evaluation to facilitate clinical decision making.",2008 Apr 1,2008,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",70,5,1607-10,eng,False,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2007.12.022;S0360-3016(07)04762-1;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2007.12.022,Evaluation Study;Journal Article,"Algorithms;*Angiography, Digital Subtraction;Feasibility Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;*Magnetic Resonance Angiography;Probability;Radiosurgery/*methods;Retrospective Studies;Sensitivity and Specificity",
32166342,Natural history of high-grade pediatric arteriovenous malformations: implications for management options.,"PURPOSE: Cerebral arteriovenous malformations are a common cause of pediatric intracranial hemorrhage. Often, small, superficial, lesions are treated surgically; however, more complex, deeper, eloquently located lesions portend higher-risk features and suffer from limitations in treatment. We sought to examine our institution's experience with the natural history of these high-grade arteriovenous malformations to explore outcomes with conservative treatment. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed to identify all pediatric cases of intracranial arteriovenous malformations seen at our institution from 2005 to 2018. Subjects with Spetzler-Martin grade IV or V lesions, treated conservatively, were examined for primary outcomes including rupture rate, progression, and functional outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 14 patients were included in the study, of which, 78.57% were classified as Spetzler-Martin grade IV and 21.43% Spetzler-Martin grade V. All patients in this study were treated conservatively, with surveillance, followed for a mean of 32.17 months (range 9.43-79.10). 7.14% experienced delayed hemorrhage or re-rupture, 7.14% had hydrocephalus, and 14.29% had seizures. Neurological sequelae included weakness, visual impairment, speech impairment, sensory changes, and dystonia; functionally independent outcomes, defined as modified Rankin Score of 0-2, were seen in 85.71% of patients. CONCLUSION: Our experience suggests that patients with large, deep lesions have significant morbidity with high rates of rupture and subsequent neurologic deficits. However, intervention of these lesions may carry high risk, and the literature suggests such lesions may have less favorable outcomes when treated. We propose conservative treatment for high-grade arteriovenous malformations as a viable option with good functional outcomes in a cohort often without good options for conventional treatment.",2020 Sep,2020,Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for,36,9,2055-2061,eng,False,10.1007/s00381-020-04550-5;10.1007/s00381-020-04550-5;10.1007/s00381-020-04550-5,Journal Article,"Child;Cohort Studies;*Embolization, Therapeutic;Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/diagnostic;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome",Arteriovenous malformations;Natural history;Pediatrics

We investigated the clinical applicability of two-dimensional thick-slice, contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance digital subtraction angiography (2D MRDSA) with high temporal resolution in the assessment of AVMs. We performed 78 2D MRDSA studies of treated or untreated small to medium-size AVMs on a 1.5 tesla imager. Two observers independently evaluated demonstration of nidus flow void on T2-weighted images and each component of the AVM on 2D MRDSA employing a three-point grading scale. In 55 patients with AVMs, the mean ratings of nidus flow voids, feeding vessels, nidi, draining vessels and early venous filling on MRI were 2.8, 2.4, 2.6, 2.8 and 2.8, respectively. sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for an AVM using 2D MRDSA were 87, 100, 100 and 78%, respectively and for nidus flow voids on T2-weighted images 80, 91, 96 and 66%, respectively. 2D MRDSA can thus demonstrate haemodynamic features of AVMs. It can be employed as a less invasive, dynamic angiographic tool for follow-up of AVMs previously delineated by catheter angiography.",2003 Jan,2003,Neuroradiology,45,1,27-33,eng,False,10.1007/s00234-002-0844-5,Journal Article,"Adult;Angiography, Digital Subtraction;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnosis/surgery;Magnetic Resonance Angiography/*methods;Male;Predictive Value of Tests;Radiosurgery;Sensitivity and Specificity",

36549849,Artificial Intelligence-Assisted Evaluation of the Spatial Relationship between Brain Arteriovenous Malformations and the Corticospinal Tract to Predict Postsurgical Motor Defects.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Preoperative evaluation of brain AVMs is crucial for the selection of surgical candidates. Our goal was to use artificial intelligence to predict postsurgical motor defects in patients with brain AVMs involving motor-related areas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-three patients who underwent microsurgical resection of brain AVMs involving motor-related areas were retrospectively reviewed. Four artificial intelligence-based indicators were calculated with artificial intelligence on TOF-MRA and DTI, including FN(5mm/50mm) (the proportion of fiber numbers within 5-50mm from the lesion border), FN(10mm/50mm) (the same but within 10-50mm), FP(5mm/50mm) (the proportion of fiber voxel points within 5-50mm from the lesion border), and FP(10mm/50mm) (the same but within 10-50mm). The association between the variables and long-term postsurgical motor defects was analyzed using univariate and multivariate analyses. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression with the Pearson correlation coefficient was used to select the optimal features to develop the machine learning model to predict postsurgical motor defects. The area under the curve was calculated to evaluate the predictive performance. RESULTS: In patients with and without postsurgical motor defects, the mean FN(5mm/50mm), FN(10mm/50mm), FP(5mm/50mm), and FP(10mm/50mm) were 0.24 (SD, 0.24) and 0.03 (SD, 0.06), 0.37 (SD, 0.27) and 0.06 (SD, 0.08), 0.06 (SD, 0.10) and 0.01 (SD, 0.02), and 0.10 (SD, 0.12) and 0.02 (SD, 0.05), respectively. Univariate and multivariate logistic analyses identified FN(10mm/50mm) as an independent risk factor for long-term postsurgical motor defects (P = .002). FN(10mm/50mm) achieved a mean area under the curve of 0.86 (SD, 0.08). The mean area under the curve of the machine learning model consisting of FN(10mm/50mm), diffuseness, and the Spetzler-Martin score was 0.88 (SD, 0.07). CONCLUSIONS: The artificial intelligence-based indicator, FN(10mm/50mm), can reflect the lesion-fiber spatial relationship and act as a dominant predictor for postsurgical motor defects in patients with brain AVMs involving motor-related areas.",2023 Jan,2023,AJNR.

10782615,Volume rendering quantification algorithm for reconstruction of CT volume-rendered structures: Part I. Cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"Volume rendering is a visualization technique that has important applications in diagnostic radiology and in radiotherapy but has not achieved widespread use due, in part, to the lack of volumetric analysis tools for comparison of volume rendering to conventional visualization techniques. The volume rendering quantification algorithm (VRQA), a technique for three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction of a structure identified on six principal volume-rendered views, is introduced and described. VRQA involves three major steps: 1) preprocessing of the partial surfaces constructed from each of six volume-rendered images; 2) merging these processed partial surfaces to define the boundaries of a volume; and 3) computation of the volume of the structure from this boundary information. After testing on phantoms, VRQA was applied to CT data of patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM's). Because volumetric visualization of the cerebral AVM is relatively insensitive to operator dependencies, such as the choice of opacity transfer function, and because precise volumetric definition of the AVM is necessary for radiosurgical treatment planning, it is representative of a class of structures that is ideal for testing and calibration of VRQA. AVM volumes obtained using VRQA are intermediate to those obtained using axial contouring and those obtained using CT-correlated biplanar angiography (two routinely used visualization techniques for treatment planning for AVM's). Applications and potential expansions of VRQA are discussed.",2000 Jan,2000,IEEE transactions on medical imaging,19,1,12-24,eng,False,10.1109/42.832956,"Journal Article;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","*Algorithms;Calibration;Cerebral Angiography;Computer Graphics;Humans;*Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnostic imaging/surgery;Phantoms, Imaging;Radiosurgery;*Tomography, X-Ray Computed",
28552161,Multimodality management of cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the brain are diverse lesions that vary widely in location, size, and complexity. Treatment options for AVMs are correspondingly complex. Complete elimination of an AVM is required to protect patients from future hemorrhage. Decisions about whether to treat and, if so, how to treat these lesions depend on the characteristics of the patient and the specific characteristics of the AVMs. The characteristics of AVMs are often summarized through grading systems. Some AVMs can be managed conservatively, whereas others can be managed with microsurgical resection, radiosurgical ablation, or endovascular embolization, either individually or in combination. Some AVMs may also be treated with partial therapy to reduce the risk of hemorrhage or to ameliorate symptoms.

A national survey was conducted to reveal the Danish incidence of the disease, presentation, choice of treatment, and outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty patients were admitted to any of the five neurosurgical centers during the years 2000-2008. A retrospective survey was conducted using hospital records. RESULTS: Twenty-three males and 17 females presented with AVM with a mean age of 11.3 (1 month-18 years). The incidence was found to be 0.4/100,000. Early fatal outcome was seen in three patients. Treatment was surgery (12), endovascular (5), radiosurgery (6), or a combination of the above (10). Four patients were treated conservatively. Complications of the treatment were seen in 27%. Occlusion rate was 74%. Good or excellent outcome was seen in 65%. CONCLUSION: A national survey may give a lower rate of success than in the specialized centers accepting patients more eligible for treatment.

METHODS: Ninety-five evaluable patients with 99 treatable AVMs were treated at the University of Washington Medical Center from April 2000 through June 2005. The median patient age at the time of treatment was 40 years (range 6-68 years). The male to female patient ratio was 0.98:1. The median AVM volume treated was 3.8 cm(3) (range 0.12-32 cm(3)). Forty-four percent of the patients had hemorrhaged prior to treatment. The median peripheral Gamma Knife surgery dose was 20 Gy with a median of 12 isocenters treated. The median follow-up duration was 38 months (range 3-91 months). Eighty-one percent of the patients had no previous stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), whereas the remaining 19% had previously been treated with linear accelerator-based SRS. RESULTS: The Kaplan-Meier estimated 6-year AVM obliteration rate for the entire cohort was 71.4%. The Kaplan-Meier estimated 6-year obliteration rate was 72% for patients having no prior SRS and 54.5% for those undergoing repeat SRS. The median time to AVM obliteration was 47 months, with 90% of the obliterations occurring between 24 and 58 months. Eight patients (7.4%) experienced late toxicities. There were 2 fatal bleeds and 13 (13.8%) nonfatal bleeds after Gamma Knife surgery.

19147019,Optimization of isocenter location for intensity modulated stereotactic treatment of small intracranial targets.,"PURPOSE: To quantify the impact of isocenter location on treatment plan quality for intensity-modulated stereotactic treatment of small intracranial lesions. METHODS AND MATERIALS: For 18 patients previously treated by stereotactic-intensity modulated radiosurgery (IMRS) or intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), a retrospective virtual planning study was conducted wherein the impact of isocenter location on plan quality was measured. Treatment indications studied included six arteriovenous malformations, six acoustic neuromas, and six intracranial metastases, ranging in volume from 0.71 to 3.21 cm(3) (mean = 2.26 cm(3)), 1.08 to 2.84 cm(3) (mean = 1.73 cm(3)), and 0.19 to 2.30 cm(3) (mean = 0.79 cm(3)), respectively. Variation of isocenter location causes the geometric grid of pencil beams into which the target is segmented for intensity-modulated treatment to be altered. The impact of this pencil-beam-grid redefinition on achievable conformity index was quantified for three collimators (Varian Millennium 120; BrainLab MM3; Nomos binary Mimic) and three treatment planning systems (TPS; Varian Eclipse v6.5; BrainLab BrainScan v5.31; Best-Nomos Corvus v6.2), resulting in the evaluation of 3,446 treatment plans. RESULTS: For all patients, collimator, and TPS combinations studied, a significant variation in plan quality was observed as a function of isocenter and pencil-beam-grid relocation. Optimization of isocenter location resulted in treatment plan conformity variations as large as 109% (min = 15%, mean = 51%, max = 109%).

METHODS: Published literature in the PubMed database by May 2016 citing embolization results for AVMs using liquid embolic agents was reviewed. Additional studies were identified through reference searches in each reviewed article. A systematic review was performed to evaluate the bleeding complications, cure rate, and long-term bleeding risk. RESULTS: We identified 30 studies, including 5103 patients. The overall cure rate was 18%. Curative embolization was achieved in 24% of monotherapy, 10% of pre-surgical, and 16% after pre-SRS. In the Onyx group, the cure rate was higher of 25% ( χ(2) = 6.25, P < 0.025). Multiple session (≥2) associated with a higher cure rate of 23% (χ(2) = 10.53, P < 0.005). The overall bleeding complication rate of transarterial embolization was 5%. The case fatality of bleeding complication was 31%. Onyx and pre-SRS embolization have a higher bleeding complication rate of 8%. The small studies reported a higher cure rate and bleeding complication rate than large studies. CONCLUSION: Onyx has increased the cure rate and bleeding complication rate of AVM embolization. Multiple sessions are associated with a higher cure rate and do not increase the bleeding complication. Current pre-SRS AVM embolization has a higher bleeding complication rate.

22095967,The predictive value of 3D time-of-flight MR angiography in assessment of brain arteriovenous malformation obliteration after radiosurgery.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of radiosurgery of bAVMs is complete angiographic obliteration of its nidus. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of 1.5T T2-weighted MR imaging and TOF-MRA images for detecting nidus obliteration after radiosurgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The pre- and postradiosurgery MR images and DSA images from 120 patients who were radiosurgically treated for a bAVM were re-evaluated by 2 observers for patency of the nidus (preradiosurgery) and obliteration (postradiosurgery: final follow-up MR imaging), by using a 3-point scale of confidence. Consensus reading of the DSA after radiosurgery was considered the criterion standard for obliteration. Sensitivity, specificity, PPVs, and NPVs, and overall diagnostic performance by using ROC were determined. RESULTS: Mean bAVM volume during radiosurgery was 3.4 mL (95% CI, 2.6-4.3 mL). Sixty-six patients (55%) had undergone previous endovascular embolization. The mean intervals between radiosurgery and follow-up MR imaging and for DSA, respectively, were 35.6 months (95% CI, 32.3-38.9 months) and 42.1 months (95% CI, 40.3-44.0 months). With ROC, an area under curve of 0.81-0.83 was found. PPVs of final follow-up MR-imaging for definitive obliteration varied between 0.89 [corrected] and 0.95. NPV was 0.52 [corrected] . An average false-positive rate, meaning overestimation of nidus obliteration of 0.10 [corrected] and an average false-negative rate, meaning underestimation of nidus obliteration of 0.42 [corrected] were found. CONCLUSIONS: MRA is insufficient to diagnose obliteration in the follow-up of bAVMs after radiosurgery. A remaining nidus diameter <10 mm seems to be the major limiting factor for reliable assessment of obliteration. We highly recommend follow-up DSA for definitive diagnosis of complete obliteration.",2012 Feb,2012,AJNR.

35902235,National reduction in cerebral arteriovenous malformation treatment correlated with increased rupture incidence.,"BACKGROUND: Recently, there has been a shift in management of unruptured cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) following studies suggesting that medical management alone was superior to interventional therapy. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the influence of contemporary AVM management on AVM rupture patterns in the United States. METHODS: 154 297 AVM admissions were identified between 2003 and 2017 in the National Inpatient Sample. Annual AVM intervention and rupture rates were computed and multivariable logistic regression assessed the likelihood of AVM intervention pre- and post-2014. Segmented regression identified significant change points and fitted segmented linear models for annual intervention and rupture rates. Correlation coefficients assessed the relationship between annual AVM intervention and rupture rates. RESULTS: For unruptured AVMs, intervention likelihood and proportion decreased after 2014 (28.1% to 22.3%, p<0.0001; adjusted OR=0.857, 95% CI 0.751 to 0.977, p=0.02). Ruptured AVM admissions increased from 14.7% to 18.6% after 2014 (p<0.0001). Between 2003 and 2017, segmented linear regression identified one significant change point in intervention rate between 2014 and 2015. Average annual percent change for rupture incidence and intervention rate increased by 0.49% (p=0.0001) and decreased by 1.17% (p=0.0001), respectively. Annual AVM intervention rates were inversely correlated with annual AVM rupture incidence (Pearson coefficient=-0.82, p=0.0002). In 2017, the annual AVM rupture rate (20.6%) surpassed the annual AVM intervention rate (19.7%). CONCLUSIONS: After 2014, the likelihood of intervention for unruptured AVMs decreased while the incidence of ruptured AVMs increased.

23892391,Angiographic features help predict outcome after stereotactic radiosurgery for the treatment of pediatric arteriovenous malformations.,"PURPOSE: Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are a frequent cause of hemorrhagic stroke in children. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is an established treatment for these lesions, particularly those that are surgically inaccessible. Because only complete AVM obliteration is believed to protect against the future risk of hemorrhage, identifying lesion characteristics that predict response to therapy is an important objective. The goal of this study is to evaluate the influence of angiographic features of AVMs on the rate of obliteration following treatment with SRS. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of pediatric patients (age ≤18 years) treated with Gamma Knife SRS for cerebral AVMs between 2000 and 2012. Detailed angiographic data at the time of initial angiographic evaluation were prospectively recorded by experienced neurointerventional radiologists. The primary outcome was the rate of obliteration on a 3-year follow-up angiogram. RESULTS: We identified 42 pediatric patients treated with SRS for cerebral AVMs. Twenty-seven patients completed 3-year angiographic follow-ups. Complete obliteration was seen in 30%, partial response in 67%, and no response in 4%. Higher SRS dose was associated with complete obliteration. Larger AVM diameter, presence of multiple draining veins, and presence of multiple draining veins reaching a sinus were associated with partial response. In this small cohort, diffuse AVM borders, presence of aneurysm, and pre-SRS embolization were not associated with obliteration. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identifies AVMs in the pediatric population with a nidus diameter of <2.5 cm and a solitary draining vein as the most likely to undergo complete obliteration after SRS treatment.",2014 Feb,2014,Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for,30,2,241-7,eng,False,10.1007/s00381-013-2231-4;10.1007/s00381-013-2231-4,Journal Article,Cerebral Angiography;Child;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Male;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome,
17937214,Optic radiation tractography integrated into simulated treatment planning for Gamma Knife surgery.,"OBJECT: No definitive method of preventing visual field deficits after stereotactic radiosurgery for lesions near the optic radiation (OR) has been available so far. The authors report the results of integrating OR tractography based on diffusion tensor (DT) magnetic resonance imaging into simulated treatment planning for Gamma Knife surgery (GKS). METHODS: Data from imaging studies performed in 10 patients who underwent GKS for treatment of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) located adjacent to the OR were used for the simulated treatment planning. Diffusion tensor images performed without the patient's head being secured by a stereotactic frame were used for DT tractography, and the OR was visualized by means of software developed by the authors. Data from stereotactic 3D imaging studies performed after frame fixation were coregistered with the data from DT tractography. The combined images were transferred to a GKS treatment-planning workstation. Delivered doses and distances between the treated lesions and the OR were analyzed and correlated with posttreatment neurological changes. RESULTS: In patients presenting with migraine with visual aura or occipital lobe epilepsy, the OR was located within 11 mm from AVMs. In a patient who developed new quadrantanopia after GKS, the OR had received 32 Gy. A maximum dose to the OR of less than 12 Gy did not cause new visual field deficits. A maximum dose to the OR of 8 Gy or more was significantly related to neurological change (p < 0.05), including visual field deficits and development or improvement of migraine. CONCLUSIONS: Integration of OR tractography into GKS represents a promising tool for preventing GKS-induced visual disturbances and headaches. Single-session irradiation at a dose of 8 Gy or more was associated with neurological change.",2007 Oct,2007,Journal of neurosurgery,107,4,721-6,eng,False,10.3171/JNS-07/10/0721,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adolescent;Adult;Brain Mapping;*Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Female;Headache/prevention & control;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/pathology/*surgery;Male;Postoperative Complications/prevention & control;Preoperative Care;Radiometry;Radiosurgery/*methods;Retrospective Studies;Stereotaxic Techniques;Vision Disorders/*prevention & control;Visual Cortex/*surgery",

27349404,Embolization with Gamma Knife Radiosurgery of Giant Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations.,"AIM: Giant arteriovenous malformations (i.e., those greater than 6 cm maximum diameter or volume > 33 cc) are difficult to treat and often carry higher treatment morbidity and mortality rates. In our study, we reviewed the angiographic results and clinical outcomes for 11 patients with giant arteriovenous malformations who were treated between 1994 and 2012. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The patients selected included 9 males (82%) and 2 females (18%). Their presenting symptoms were hemorrhage (n=2; 18%), seizure (n=7; 64%), and headache (n=2; 12%). Nine patients were Spetzler-Martin Grade III, 2 were Spetzler-Martin Grade IV. The mean arteriovenous malformation volume was 41 cc (33-52 cc). The mean age of the patients was 45.1 years (24-57 years) and the mean radiation dose delivered to the margin of the nidus was 14.2 Gy. RESULTS: Ten patients received pre-Gamma Knife radiosurgery embolization and Gamma Knife radiosurgery, 1 patient received pre-Gamma Knife radiosurgery embolization and Gamma Knife radiosurgery twice and the interval between Gamma Knife radiosurgeries was 3 months. The complete obliteration rate following Gamma Knife radiosurgery was 36%, subtotal obliteration ( > 70% decreased size of nidus) was 36%, and partial obliteration was 28%. One patient experienced a small hemorrhage after embolization. CONCLUSION: Combined embolization and Gamma Knife radiosurgery showed successful obliteration of the arteriovenous malformation nidus. The use of embolization to initially reduce nidus size followed by Gamma Knife radiosurgery improves the treatment results.

35616021,Hemorrhage and Recurrence of Obliterated Brain Arteriovenous Malformations Treated With Stereotactic Radiosurgery.,"BACKGROUND: Although complete nidal obliteration of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVM) is generally presumed to represent durable cure, postobliteration hemorrhage, and AVM recurrence have become increasingly recognized phenomena. The goal of the study was to define hemorrhage and nidal recurrence risks of obliterated AVMs treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study from the International Radiosurgery Research Foundation comprising AVM patients treated between 1987 and 2020. Patients with AVM obliteration on digital subtraction angiography (DSA) were included. Outcomes were (1) hemorrhage and (2) AVM recurrence. Follow-up duration began at the time of AVM obliteration and was censored at subsequent hemorrhage, AVM recurrence, additional AVM treatment, or loss to follow-up. Annualized risk and survival analyses were performed. A sensitivity analysis comprising patients with AVM obliteration on magnetic resonance imaging or DSA was also performed for postobliteration hemorrhage. RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 1632 SRS-treated patients with AVM obliteration on DSA. Pediatric patients comprised 15% of the cohort, and 42% of AVMs were previously ruptured. The mean imaging follow-up after AVM obliteration was 22 months. Among 1607 patients with DSA-confirmed AVM obliteration, 16 hemorrhages (1.0%) occurred over 2223 patient-years of follow-up (0.72%/y). Of the 1543 patients with DSA-confirmed AVM obliteration, 5 AVM recurrences (0.32%) occurred over 2071 patient-years of follow-up (0.24%/y). Of the 16 patients with postobliteration hemorrhage, AVM recurrence was identified in 2 (12.5%). In the sensitivity analysis comprising 1939 patients with post-SRS AVM obliteration on magnetic resonance imaging or DSA, 16 hemorrhages (0.83%) occurred over 2560 patient-years of follow-up (0.63%/y). CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial hemorrhage and recurrent arteriovenous shunting after complete nidal obliteration are rare in AVM patients treated with SRS, and each phenomenon harbors an annual risk of <1%.

26587653,Management of arteriovenous malformations in the elderly: a single-center case series and analysis of outcomes.,"OBJECT Treatment of brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) in the elderly remains a challenge for cerebrovascular surgeons. In this study the authors reviewed the patient characteristics, treatments, angiographic results, and clinical outcomes in 28 patients over 65 years of age who were treated at Henry Ford Hospital between 1990 and 2014. METHODS The bAVM database at the authors' institution was queried for records of elderly patients with bAVMs, and data regarding patient demographics, presenting symptoms, bAVM angioarchitecture, treatment modalities, angiographic results, clinical outcomes, and treatment complications were tabulated and analyzed. RESULTS There were 9 male (32%) and 19 female (68%) patients, with an average age ( ± SD) of 73.0 ± 6.95 years. The most common symptoms on presentation were hemorrhage (36%) and headaches (18%). The bAVMs were equally distributed between the supra- and infratentorial compartments. The most common Spetzler-Martin grade was II, observed in 57% of the patients. Eleven patients (39.3%) underwent resection, 4 patients (14.3%) received standalone radiation therapy, and 13 patients (46%) did not receive treatment or were managed expectantly. Four patients (14.3%) were lost to follow-up. Complete bAVM obliteration was achieved in 87% of the treated patients. None of the patients who received any form of treatment died; the overall mortality rate was 3.6%.

38744729,Clinical outcomes of posterior fossa arteriovenous malformations: a single center experience.,"BACKGROUND: Posterior fossa arterio-venous malformations (pfAVMs) are challenging lesions due to the anatomical particularities of the posterior fossa, and the high incidence of hemorrhagic presentation. The two most important goals when treating AVMs are preserving neurological function and preventing rupture, or a second hemorrhage. The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical and imaging features of pfAVMs to identify the factors that influence the prognosis of these patients. METHODS: We conducted a single-center retrospective observational study that included patients treated at our institution with pfAVMs between January 1997 and December 2021. RESULTS: A total of 48 patients were included. A good modified Rankin score (mRS) was observed in 33 cases (69%) at presentation. Thirty-four patients (71%) presented with a ruptured AVM. Out of these, 19 patients (40%) had intraventricular hemorrhage. Microsurgical resection was performed in 33 cases (69%), while in the other cases, the patients opted for conservative management (7 cases, 15%), stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) (6 cases, 12%), or endovascular treatment (2 cases, 4%). Patients ≤ 30 years old were more prone to hemorrhagic presentation (OR: 5.23; 95% CI: 1.42-17.19; p = 0.024) and this remained an independent risk factor for rupture after multivariate analysis as well (OR: 4.81; 95% CI: 1.07-21.53; p = 0.040). Following multivariate analysis, the only factor independently associated with poor prognosis in the surgically treated subgroup was a poor clinical status (mRS 3-5) at admission (OR: 96.14; 95% CI: 5.15-1793.9; p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Management of posterior fossa AVMs is challenging, and patients who present with ruptured AVMs often have a poor clinical status at admission leading to a poor prognosis. Therefore, proper and timely management of these patients is essential.",2024 May 14,2024,Acta neurochirurgica,166,1,215,eng,False,10.1007/s00701-024-06116-9;215;10.1007/s00701-024-06116-9;6116;10.1007/s00701-024-06116-9,Journal Article;Observational Study,"Humans;Female;Male;Adult;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery/therapy;Retrospective Studies;Middle Aged;Young Adult;Adolescent;*Radiosurgery/methods;Treatment Outcome;*Cranial Fossa, Posterior/surgery;Child;Endovascular Procedures/methods;Prognosis;Microsurgery/methods",Clinical outcome;Posterior fossa arteriovenous malformations;Prognostic factors;Treatment modalities
28669269,Microsurgical management of a high-grade brain arteriovenous malformation in the central lobe after unsuccessful radiosurgery.,"The recommendation for the great majority of high-grade brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) is observation, except for those patients with recurrent hemorrhages, progressive neurological deficits, steal-related symptoms, or AVM-related aneurysms, for whom intervention should be considered. These are general recommendations, and the decision should be made on an individual basis. Surgical resection of an AVM in the central lobe may cause postoperative sensorimotor deficits since this anatomical region includes the pre- and postcentral gyri on the lateral surface and the paracentral lobule on the medial surface. The authors present a patient with a ruptured high-grade bAVM in the central lobe who underwent previous surgery for hematoma evacuation and previous radiosurgery, and whose indication for reoperation was proposed based on progressive hemiparesis. Microsurgical resection was possible after a wide frontoparietal craniotomy, which made all the nidus borders accessible. This case illustrates the anatomy and surgical technique for large nidus AVMs in eloquent areas, showing that complete microsurgical resection is possible with good clinical outcome.

10839256,Repeated radiosurgery for incompletely obliterated arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECT: The goal of this study was to define treatment results of repeated arteriovenous malformation (AVM) radiosurgery, namely AVM obliteration and complications. METHODS: The authors analyzed their experience with repeated AVM radiosurgery performed in 41 patients for whom follow-up review lasted at least 2 years. The median duration of follow up was 34 months (range 7-65 months) after repeated radiosurgery in this group. The residual nidus was located within the area of focus (in field) of the initial radiosurgery in 28 patients (68%). Initial doses to the margin varied from 12.5 to 20 Gy (median 18 Gy). During repeated treatment the dose to the margin varied from 12.5 to 20 Gy (median 17 Gy) and the retreated volumes ranged from 0.4 to 7 cm3 (median 2.1 cm3). Follow-up angiography performed at least 2 years postradiosurgery revealed complete AVM obliteration in 21 (70%) of 30 patients. The estimated overall 2-year obliteration rate, based on findings on magnetic resonance imaging (eight of 11 obliterated) and angiography (29 of 41 obliterated) was 71%. Obliteration rates correlated with margin doses (p = 0.0045) with a trend toward higher rates in cases with in-field nidus persistence (p = 0.0637). The dose-response curve for AVM nidus obliteration was not significantly different from that of the initial radiosurgery. In two patients (5%) intracranial AVM hemorrhage developed within 125.9 risk years after repeated radiosurgery (1.6% per patient year). Persistent symptomatic adverse radiation effects developed in two (5%) of 41 patients following repeated radiosurgery. Postradiosurgical imaging changes were identified in 11 (27%) of 41 patients, which correlated with a 12-Gy volume from repeated surgery (p = 0.019). CONCLUSIONS: When necessary, repeated AVM radiosurgery achieves obliteration with an acceptable risk. Despite the effects of previous irradiation, repeated radiosurgery required similar or slightly higher radiation doses to achieve the same in-field obliteration rates as those needed to obliterate an AVM that had not been treated by radiation previously.",2000 Jun,2000,Journal of neurosurgery,92,6,961-70,eng,True,10.3171/jns.2000.92.6.0961,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Cerebral Angiography;Child;Child, Preschool;Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;*Radiosurgery;Reoperation;Stereotaxic Techniques;Treatment Outcome",
36255184,Prognosis of Rotational Angiography-Based Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Dural Arteriovenous Fistulas: A Retrospective Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Cerebral dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) are intracranial vascular malformations with fine, abnormal vascular architecture. High-resolution vascular imaging is vital for their visualization. Currently, rotational angiography (RA) provides the finest 3-dimensional visualization of the arteriovenous shunt with high spatial resolution; however, the efficacies of the integration of RA have never been studied in stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for DAVFs until now. Since 2015, our institution has integrated RA into SRS (RA-SRS) to provide more conformal planning, thereby decreasing overtreatment and undertreatment. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the outcomes of RA-SRS for DAVFs. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of 51 patients with DAVFs and compared those of 20 DAVFs treated with RA-SRS with those of 31 DAVFs treated with conventional SRS (c-SRS). RESULTS: The time to obliteration was shorter in the RA-SRS group (median, 15 months vs 26 months [cumulative rate, 77% vs 33% at 2 years, 77% vs 64% at 4 years]; P = .015). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis demonstrated that RA-SRS (hazard ratio 2.39, 95% CI 1.13-5.05; P = .022) and the absence of cortical venous reflux (hazard ratio 2.12, 95% CI 1.06-4.25; P = .034) were significantly associated with obliteration. The cumulative 5-year post-SRS stroke-free survival rates were 95% and 97% in the RA-SRS and c-SRS groups, respectively ( P = .615). Neurological improvement tended to occur earlier in the RA-SRS group than in the c-SRS group (median time to improvement, 5 months vs 20 months, log-rank test; P = .077).

33863526,A case of delayed cyst formation post brain AVM stereotactic radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformation: Case report.,"Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are a rare cause of cerebrovascular abnormality with incidence of about 1 in 100,000 people per year and point prevalence of about 0.2%. AVMs are associated with serious complications such as intracranial haemorrhage (2-4% a year, 16% and 29% at 10 and 20 years after diagnosis), seizures (10-30%), focal neurologic deficits, and headaches. The management options are surveillance, endovascular embolization, microsurgical excision and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). In SRS Stereotactically focused high energy beams of photons induce progressive thrombosis by fibro-intimal hyperplasia and subsequent luminal obliteration. These changes usually take one to three years known as ""latency period"". Complications are reported in 8% of patients undergoing SRS, including radiographic parenchymal lesions, cranial nerve deficits, seizures, headaches, and cyst formation. Cyst formation is reported in about 1.2 % of patients undergoing SRS. While the exact mechanism of post SRS cyst formation is unclear, it is hypothesized that it might be due to damage to the blood brain barrier and increased vessel wall permeability. Delayed cyst formation is reported with latency period between 3 and 10 years after radiotherapy for treatment of cerebrovascular AVMs. However, cystic formation with longer latency periods (in one case upto 17 years) after radiotherapy for other causes such as nasopharyngeal cancers have been reported.

31442655,Volume-Staged Gamma Knife Radiosurgery for Large Brain Arteriovenous Malformation.,"OBJECTIVE: Large brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) pose a management dilemma because of the limited success of any single treatment modality by itself. Surgery alone is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Similarly, embolization alone has limited efficacy. Volume-staged Gamma Knife radiosurgery (VSGR) has been developed for the treatment of large AVMs to increase the efficacy and improve safety of treatment of these lesions. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of VSGR technique for the treatment of large brain AVMs. METHODS: The study included patients treated by VSGR between May 2009 and July 2015. All patients had large AVMs (>10 mL). There were 29 patients. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients completed radiographic follow-up, with 15 obliteration cases (62.5%). A total of 56 sessions were performed. The mean AVM volume was 16 mL (range, 10.1-29.3 mL). The mean prescription dose was 18 Gy (range, 14-22 Gy). The mean follow-up duration was 43 months (range, 21-73 months). One patient died during follow-up of an unrelated cause. Two patients had hemorrhage during follow-up. Symptomatic edema developed in 5 patients (17%). The factors affecting obliteration were smaller total volume, higher dose/stage, nondeep location, compact AVM, AVM score <3, >18 Gy dose, and <15 mL total volume. The factors affecting symptomatic edema were smaller total volume and shorter time between first and last sessions (P = 0.012). T2 image changes were affected by Spetzler-Martin grade ≥3 (P = 0.013) and AVM score ≥3 (P = 0.014).

In some instances an AVM will derive its blood supply from more than one main cervical artery (carotid and/or vertebral artery) and a single-vessel injection will not adequately demonstrate the entire AVM nidus. METHODS: Three patients with cerebral AVM in whom the entire nidus could not be visualized by injection of a single cervical artery are reported. CBCT dataset acquisition was performed by intra-arterial contrast injection in the ascending thoracic aorta through a 5 F pigtail catheter. The injection of diluted iodinated contrast agent (35%) lasted 22 s at a rate of 8 ml/s for a total volume of 176 ml (61.6 ml of contrast agent). The dataset was then processed using standard reconstruction methods. RESULTS: Contrast injection in the ascending aorta during a single CBCT acquisition provided a volumetric dataset adequate for subsequent radiosurgical treatment planning. CONCLUSION: This is a safe and effective angiographic technique for the acquisition of volumetric datasets using CBCT that are suitable for treatment planning of intracranial AVMs deriving their blood supply from more than one major cervical artery. This technique allows imaging of the entire AVM nidus during a single CBCT acquisition.,2012 Sep,2012,Journal of neurointerventional surgery,4,5,e28,eng,False,10.1136/neurintsurg-2011-010115;neurintsurg-2011-010115;10.1136/neurintsurg-2011-010115,"Case Reports;Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adult;Aged;Aorta, Thoracic/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Contrast Media;Disease Management;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Male;Radiosurgery/*methods;Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*methods;Young Adult",

27911248,International multicenter cohort study of pediatric brain arteriovenous malformations. Part 1: Predictors of hemorrhagic presentation.,"OBJECTIVE Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are the most common cause of spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage in pediatric patients (age < 18 years). Since the cumulative lifetime risk of AVM hemorrhage is considerable in children, an improved understanding of the risk factors influencing hemorrhagic presentation may aid in the management of pediatric AVMs. The aims of this first of a 2-part multicenter, retrospective cohort study are to evaluate the incidence and determine the predictors of hemorrhagic presentation in pediatric AVM patients. METHODS The authors analyzed pooled AVM radiosurgery data from 7 institutions participating in the International Gamma Knife Research Foundation (IGKRF). Patients younger than 18 years at the time of radiosurgery and who had at least 12 months of follow-up were included in the study cohort. Patient and AVM characteristics were compared between unruptured and ruptured pediatric AVMs. RESULTS A total of 357 pediatric patients were eligible for analysis, including 112 patients in the unruptured and 245 patients in the ruptured AVM cohorts (69% incidence of hemorrhagic presentation). The annual hemorrhage rate prior to radiosurgery was 6.3%. Hemorrhagic presentation was significantly more common in deep locations (basal ganglia, thalamus, and brainstem) than in cortical locations (frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes) (76% vs 62%, p = 0.006). Among the factors found to be significantly associated with hemorrhagic presentation in the multivariate logistic regression analysis, deep venous drainage (OR 3.2, p < 0.001) was the strongest independent predictor, followed by female sex (OR 1.7, p = 0.042) and smaller AVM volume (OR 1.1, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Unruptured and ruptured pediatric AVMs have significantly different patient and nidal features. Pediatric AVM patients who possess 1 or more of these high-risk features may be candidates for relatively more aggressive management strategies.",2017 Feb,2017,Journal of neurosurgery.

25423274,A treatment paradigm for high-grade brain arteriovenous malformations: volume-staged radiosurgical downgrading followed by microsurgical resection.,"OBJECT: The surgical treatment of many large arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is associated with substantial risks, and many are considered inoperable. Furthermore, AVMs larger than 3 cm in diameter are not usually treated with conventional single-session radiosurgery encompassing the entire AVM volume. Volume-staged stereotactic radiosurgery (VS-SRS) is an option for large AVMs, but it has mixed results. The authors report on a series of patients with high-grade AVMs who underwent multiple VS-SRS sessions with resultant downgrading of the AVMs, followed by resection. METHODS: A cohort of patients was retrieved from a single-institution AVM patient registry consisting of prospectively collected data. VS-SRS was performed as a planned intentional treatment. Surgery was considered as salvage therapy in select patients. RESULTS: Sixteen AVMs underwent VS-SRS followed by surgery. Four AVMs presented with rupture. The mean patient age was 25.3 years (range 13-54 years). The average initial Spetzler-Martin grade before any treatment was 4, while the average supplemented Spetzler-Martin grade (Spetzler-Martin plus Lawton-Young) was 7.1. The average AVM size in maximum dimension was 5.9 cm (range 3.3-10 cm). All AVMs were supratentorial in location and all except one were in eloquent areas of the brain, with 7 involving primary motor cortex. The mean number of VS-SRS sessions was 2.7 (range 2-5 sessions). The mean interval between first VS-SRS session and resection was 5.7 years. There were 4 hemorrhages that occurred after VS-SRS. The average Spetzler-Martin grade was reduced to 2.5 (downgrade, -1.5) and the average supplemented Spetzler-Martin grade was reduced to 5.6 (downgrade, -1.5). The maximum AVM size was reduced to an average of 3.0 cm (downsize=-2.9 cm). The mean modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores were 1.2, 2.3, and 2.2 before VS-SRS, before surgery, and at last follow-up, respectively (mean follow-up, 6.9 years). Fifteen AVMs were cured after surgery. Ten patients had good outcomes at last follow-up (7 with mRS Score 0 or 1, and 3 with mRS Score 2). There were 2 deaths (both mRS Score 1 before treatment) and 4 patients with mRS Score 3 outcome (from mRS Scores 0, 1, and 2 [n=2]). CONCLUSIONS: Volume-staged SRS can downgrade AVMs, transforming high-grade AVMs (initially considered inoperable) into operable AVMs with acceptable surgical risks. This treatment paradigm offers an alternative to conservative observation for young patients with unruptured AVMs and long life expectancy, where the risk of hemorrhage is substantial. Difficult AVMs were cured in 15 patients. Surgical morbidity associated with downgraded AVMs is reduced to that of postradiosurgical/preoperative supplemented Spetzler-Martin grades, not their initial AVM grades.",2015 Feb,2015,Journal of neurosurgery,122,2,419-32,eng,False,10.3171/2014.10.JNS1424;10.3171/2014.10.JNS1424,Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Cerebral Revascularization;Cohort Studies;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/classification/diagnosis/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Postoperative Complications/epidemiology;Prospective Studies;Radiosurgery/*methods;Registries;Retrospective Studies;Risk Factors;*Severity of Illness Index;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult,AVM = arteriovenous malformation;Gamma Knife;SRS = stereotactic radiosurgery;SS = single-session;Spetzler-Martin grade;VS = volume-staged;arteriovenous malformation;mRS = modified Rankin Scale;microsurgical resection;stereotactic radiosurgery;supplementary grade;vascular disorders

18706220,Clinical and pathological changes in cerebral arteriovenous malformations after stereotactic radiosurgery failure.,"BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiosurgery is an alternative to resection of intracranial cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), while it will fail in some cases. This study aimed to evaluate the changes after stereotactic radiosurgery for AVMs. METHODS: Nineteen cases with cerebral AVMs had failure after stereotactic radiosurgery therapy. The symptoms and angiography were assessed. All patients underwent microsurgery. Pathologic examination was performed for all cases and electron microscopic examination was carried out in 6 patients. RESULTS: Seven cases had hemorrhage from 12 to 98 months after stereotactic radiosurgery, 5 had headache, 4 had refractory encephalon edema, 2 had epilepsy as a new symptom and 1 had a pressure cyst 5 years after radiosurgery. Angiography in 18 cases, 8 - 98 months after radiation therapy, demonstrated no significant changes in 5 cases, slight reduction in 9, near complete obliteration in 1 and complete obliteration in 3. An abnormal vessel was found on pathologic examination in 17 cases, even one case had obliterated in angiography. Electron microscopy examination showed vessel wall weakness, but the vessels remained open and blood circulated. One case died because of a moribund state before surgery. The other 18 cases had no new neurological deficiencies, seizure control and no hemorrhage occurred after microsurgery at an average follow-up of 3 years. CONCLUSION: Stereotactic radiotherapy for AVMs should have a long period follow-up. If serious complications occur, microsurgery can be performed as salvage treatment.",2008 Jun 20,2008,Chinese medical journal,121,12,1076-9,eng,False,,Journal Article,Adult;Cerebral Angiography;Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology;Female;Headache/etiology;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/*pathology/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Postoperative Complications;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects;Treatment Outcome,
12654453,Patterns of patient movement during frameless image-guided radiosurgery.,"PURPOSE: Image-guided radiosurgery aligns the treatment beam to the target site by using a radiographic imaging system to locate anatomic landmarks associated with the treatment target. Because the procedure is performed without a rigid frame, the precision of dose alignment can be affected by patient movement. Movement is limited by noninvasive restraints and compensated by remeasuring the target position at short intervals throughout treatment and then realigning the beam. Frameless image-guided radiosurgery has been used at our institution to treat 250 cranial, 23 spinal, 9 lung, and 3 pancreas cases involving malignant and benign tumors as well as vascular malformations. We have analyzed the target position records for all of these cases to assess the frequency, magnitude, and case-by-case patterns of patient movement. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The position of the treatment site during image-guided radiosurgery was measured at approximately 1-2-min intervals, on average, using orthogonal amorphous silicon X-ray cameras and an image registration process that determined all six degrees of freedom in the target's position. The change in position from one measurement to the next was indicative of patient movement. RESULTS: The treatment site position along each axis of translation was observed to vary by an average of 0.45 mm for the cranium, 0.53 mm for the cervical spine, 0.53 mm for the lumbar and thoracic spine, 1.06 mm for the lung, and 1.50 mm for the pancreas. Half of all cranial cases showed systematic drifting of the target away from the initial setup position. CONCLUSION: Using noninvasive restraints and supports, short-term movement of the head and spine during image-guided radiosurgery was limited to a radius of 0.8 mm, which satisfies the prevailing standard for radiosurgical dose alignment precision, but maintaining this margin of error throughout a treatment fraction requires regular monitoring of the target site's position.",2003 Apr 1,2003,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",55,5,1400-8,eng,False,S0360301602045972;10.1016/s0360-3016(02)04597-2,Journal Article,"Brain Neoplasms/surgery;Cervical Vertebrae;Equipment Design;Head Movements;Humans;*Immobilization;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery;Lung Neoplasms/surgery;*Movement;Pancreatic Neoplasms/surgery;Particle Accelerators;Posture;Radiosurgery/*instrumentation/methods;Reproducibility of Results;Respiration;Restraint, Physical/*instrumentation;Robotics;Spinal Neoplasms/surgery;*Surgery, Computer-Assisted",
10930008,Gamma surgery for vein of Galen malformations.,"OBJECT: The goal of this study was to evaluate the results of gamma surgery in nine patients treated for vein of Galen malformations (VGMs). METHODS: A consecutive series of nine VGMs in eight children aged 4 to 14 years and in one adult were treated with gamma surgery. Six of the patients were male, including the adult, and three were female. Among these patients there were three Yasargil Type I, one Type II, two Type III, and three Type IV malformations. Previous embolization had failed in four cases. Three VGMs were treated with gamma surgery twice. An additional patient with a Type III VGM underwent stereotactic angiography in preparation for gamma surgery but was judged to be suitable for direct embolization. Follow-up angiograms were obtained in eight of the VGMs treated. Four no longer filled; one has probably been obliterated, but this cannot be confirmed because the patient refused to undergo final angiography; one patient has residual fistulas not included in the initial treatment field, which were retreated recently; and two other patients have marked reduction of flow through their VGMs. CONCLUSIONS: Gamma surgery is a viable option in the treatment of VGMs in clinically stable patients.

32892720,Microsurgical approach for symptomatic brain AVMs - single center experience.,"Objectives: Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) represent high-flow vascular lesions made up of a complex network of feeding arteries and draining veins interposed by a nidus and without a capillary bed. The management of the AVMs represents a challenge, and the optimal treatment should be considered based on the particularities of each AVM. This paper aims to provide outcome data for the cohort of patients with AVMs that underwent surgical treatment. Methods: A retrospective review of patients who presented with AVMs between 2001 and 2019 was conducted. Patients were included if they underwent surgery, preoperative and postoperative angiographic studies were available. Results: 91 patients were included. The SM grade was 1 in 16 cases (17,6%), 2 in 27 patients (29.7%), 3 in 29 patients (31,9%), 4 in 12 cases (13.2%) and grade 5 in 7 cases (7.7%). In 58 (63.7%) cases the AVMs were ruptured.

32411406,Updates in arteriovenous malformation management: the post-ARUBA era.,"Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are complex and heterogeneous lesions that can rupture, causing significant morbidity and mortality. While ruptured lesions are usually treated, the management of unruptured AVMs remains unclear. A Randomized trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformations (ARUBA) was the first trial conducted to compare the effects of medical and interventional therapy. Although it concluded that medical therapy was superior in preventing stroke and death over a follow-up period of 33 months, the findings were met with intense criticism regarding several aspects of study design, progression, and analysis/conclusion. Namely, the increased use of stand-alone embolisation relative to microsurgery in a cohort with predominantly low-grade lesions combined with a short follow-up period amplified treatment risk. Subsequently, several observational studies were conducted on ARUBA-eligible patients to investigate the safety and efficacy of microsurgery, radiosurgery, and endovascular embolisation over longer follow-up periods. These reports showed that favourable safety profiles and cure rates can be achieved with appropriate patient selection and judicious use of different treatment modalities in multidisciplinary centres. Since large prospective randomised trials on AVMs may not be feasible, it is important to make use of practice-based data beyond the flawed ARUBA study to optimise patients' lifetime outcomes.",2020,2020,Stroke and vascular neurology,5,1,34-39,eng,False,10.1136/svn-2019-000248;svn-2019-000248;10.1136/svn-2019-000248,Journal Article;Review,"Cerebrovascular Circulation;Clinical Decision-Making;*Embolization, Therapeutic/adverse effects/mortality;*Endovascular Procedures/adverse effects/mortality;Evidence-Based Medicine;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic;*Microsurgery/adverse effects/mortality;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects/mortality;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Research Design;Risk Assessment;Risk Factors;Stroke/diagnosis/mortality/physiopathology/*prevention & control;Treatment Outcome",hemorrhage;intracranial arteriovenous malformations;microsurgery;radiosurgery
22014949,Integration of corticospinal tractography reduces motor complications after radiosurgery.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate whether the use of diffusion-tensor tractography (DTT) of the corticospinal tract could reduce motor complications after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in the deep frontal lobe, deep parietal lobe, basal ganglia, and thalamus who had undergone radiosurgery since 2000 and were followed up for more than 3 years were studied. DTT of the corticospinal tract had been integrated into treatment planning of SRS since 2004, and the maximum dose received by the corticospinal tract was attempted to be less than 20 Gy. Treatment outcomes before (28 patients, Group A) and after (24 patients, Group B) the introduction of this technique were compared. RESULTS: There were no statistical differences between the two groups (Group A vs. Group B) in patients' age (34 years vs. 33 years, p = 0.76), percentage of patients with hemorrhagic events before treatment (50% vs. 29%, p = 0.12), or percentage of AVM involving the basal ganglia and thalamus (36% vs. 46%, p = 0.46). Obliteration rates were 69% and 76% at 4 years in Groups A and B, respectively (p = 0.68), which were not significantly different. Motor complications were observed in 5 patients in Group A (17.9%) but only in 1 patient in Group B (4.2%), which was significantly less frequent (p = 0.021).

21548746,A 10-year experience of radiosurgical treatment for cerebral arteriovenous malformations: a perspective from a series with large malformations. Clinical article.,"OBJECT: The purpose of this study was to describe a 10-year experience in the use of radiosurgery (RS) for patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in Puerto Rico. METHODS: This retrospective analysis was performed for all patients with AVMs treated with RS by the senior author (R.H.B.) in Puerto Rico. Between February 1999 and December 2009, a total of 83 patients underwent the procedure. All charts were reviewed for recollection of demographic data, and AVM and treatment characteristics. Clinical and radiographic follow-up information was collected retrospectively. RESULTS: Eighty-three patients were treated and 86 RS procedures for AVMs were performed during a 10-year period. Eight patients were lost to follow-up. The remaining 75 patients included 36 males and 39 females, whose median age was 34.5 years. Hemorrhage was the initial presentation in 40% of patients. Fifty-seven AVMs (73%) were treated previously with endovascular neurosurgery, without success. The median volume of the malformation was 17.7 ml. Nearly 65% of the malformations were considered large (≥ 10 ml) in volume. Forty patients had AVMs with largest diameter ≥ 3.5 cm. The overall obliteration rate was 56.4%, and the median time for obliteration was 29 months. The AVMs ≥ 3.5 cm in diameter had a greater latency period than those < 3.5 cm (31 months vs 46 months, respectively; p = 0.01). In addition, AVM obliteration was inversely associated with its volume, especially in large lesions (p = 0.037). In bivariate analysis, patients achieving obliteration had lower Spetzler-Martin scores compared with patients in whom obliteration was not achieved (p = 0.009). Postradiosurgery hemorrhages were seen in 9 cases. Eleven patients underwent surgery after RS. Major neurological deficits developed in 9 patients, whereas 17 had only minor deficits. The occurrence of neurological deficits was significantly associated with lesions with volume ≥ 10 ml.

15035275,Stereotactic radiosurgery for brainstem arteriovenous malformations: factors affecting outcome.,"OBJECT: Management options for arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the brainstem are limited. The long-term results of stereotactic radiosurgery for these disease entities are poorly understood. In this report the authors reviewed both neurological and radiological outcomes following stereotactic radiosurgery for brainstem AVMs over 15 years of experience. METHODS: Fifty patients with brainstem AVMs underwent gamma knife surgery between 1987 and 2002. There were 29 male and 21 female patients with an age range of 7 to 79 years (median 35 years). Anatomical locations of these AVMs included the midbrain (39 lesions), pons (20 lesions), and medulla oblongata (three lesions). The radiation dose applied to the margin of the AVM varied from 12 to 26 Gy (median 20 Gy). Forty-five patients were followed up from 5 to 176 months (mean 72 months). The angiographically confirmed actuarial obliteration rate was 66% at the final follow-up examination. Two patients experienced a hemorrhage before obliteration. The annual hemorrhage rate was 1.7% for the first 3 years after radiosurgery and 0% thereafter. Patients who had received irradiation at two or fewer isocenters had higher obliteration rates (80% compared with 44% for > two isocenters, p = 0.006), and this was related to a more spherical nidus shape. The rate of persistent neurological complications in patients treated using magnetic resonance imaging-based dose planning after 1993 was 7%, compared with 20% in patients treated before 1993. An older patient age, a lesion located in the tectum, and a higher radiosurgery-based score were significantly associated with greater neurological complications. CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic radiosurgery provided complete obliteration of AVMs in two thirds of the patients with a low risk of latency-interval hemorrhage. Better three-dimensional imaging studies and conformal dose planning reduced the risk of adverse radiation effects. Younger patients harboring more spherical AVMs that did not involve the tectal plate had the best outcomes.",2004 Mar,2004,Journal of neurosurgery,100,3,407-13,eng,True,10.3171/jns.2004.100.3.0407,Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Brain Stem/abnormalities/*blood supply/*surgery;Cerebrovascular Circulation/physiology;Child;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/*instrumentation;Treatment Outcome,
39266257,DSA Quantitative Analysis and Predictive Modeling of Obliteration in Cerebral AVM following Stereotactic Radiosurgery.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stereotactic radiosurgery is a key treatment modality for cerebral AVMs, particularly for small lesions and those located in eloquent brain regions. Predicting obliteration remains challenging due to evolving treatment paradigms and complex AVM presentations. With digital subtraction angiography (DSA) being the gold standard for outcome evaluation, radiomic approaches offer potential for more objective and detailed analysis. We aimed to develop machine learning modeling using DSA quantitative features for post-SRS obliteration prediction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective registry of patients with cerebral AVMs was screened to include patients with digital prestereotactic radiosurgery DSA. Anterior-posterior and lateral views were retrieved and manually segmented. Quantitative features were computed from the lesion ROI. Following feature selection, machine learning models were developed to predict unsuccessful 2-year total obliteration using processed radiomics features in comparison with clinical and radiosurgical features. When we evaluated through area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), accuracy, area under the precision-recall curve F1, recall, and precision, the best performing model predictions on the test set were interpreted using the Shapley additive explanations approach. RESULTS: DSA images of 100 included patients were retrieved and analyzed. The best-performing clinical radiosurgical model was a gradient boosting classifier with an AUROC of 68% and a recall of 67%. When we used radiomics variables as input, the AdaBoost classifier had the best evaluation metrics with an AUROC of 79% and a recall of 75%. The most important clinico-radiosurgical features, ranked by model contribution, were lesion volume, patient age, treatment dose rate, the presence of seizure at presentation, and prior resection. The most important ranked radiomics features were the following: gray-level size zone matrix, gray-level nonuniformity, kurtosis, sphericity, skewness, and gray-level dependence matrix dependence nonuniformity. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of radiomics with machine learning is a promising approach for predicting cerebral AVM obliteration status following stereotactic radiosurgery. DSA could enhance prognostication of stereotactic radiosurgery-treated AVMs due to its high spatial resolution. Model interpretation is essential for building transparent models and establishing clinically valid radiomic signatures.",2024 Oct 3,2024,AJNR.

19025357,Arcuate fasciculus tractography integrated into Gamma Knife surgery.,"OBJECT: To prevent speech disturbances after Gamma Knife surgery (GKS), the authors integrated arcuate fasciculus (AF) tractography based on diffusion tensor (DT) MR imaging into treatment planning for GKS. METHODS: Arcuate fasciculus tractography was retrospectively integrated into planning that had been previously performed by neurosurgeons and radiation oncologists. This technique was retrospectively applied to 12 patients with arteriovenous malformations adjacent to the AF. Diffusion tensor images were acquired before the frame was affixed to the patient's head and DT tractography images of the AF were created using the authors' original software. The data from DT tractography and stereotactic 3D imaging studies obtained after frame fixation were transported to a treatment planning workstation for GKS and coregistered so that the delivered doses and incidence of posttreatment aphasia could be assessed. RESULTS: The AF could not be depicted in 2 patients who initially presented with motor aphasia caused by hemorrhaging from arteriovenous malformations. During the median follow-up period of 29 months after GKS, aphasia developed in 2 patients: 30 Gy delivered to the frontal portion of the AF caused conduction aphasia in 1 patient, and 9.6 Gy to the temporal portion led to motor aphasia in the other. Speech dysfunction was not observed after a maximum radiation dose of 10.0-16.8 Gy was delivered to the frontal fibers in 4 patients, and 3.6-5.2 Gy to the temporal fibers in 3. CONCLUSIONS: The authors found that administration of a 10-Gy radiation dose during GKS was tolerated in the frontal but not the temporal fibers of the AF. The authors recommend confirmation of the dose by integration of AF tractography with GKS, especially in lesions located near the temporal language fibers.",2009 Sep,2009,Journal of neurosurgery,111,3,520-6,eng,False,10.3171/2008.4.17521;10.3171/2008.4.17521,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Adult;Aphasia/etiology;Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Postoperative Complications;Radiosurgery/*methods;Software;Speech Disorders/*prevention & control,
12914855,[Radiation sensitivity testing and late neurological complications following radiosurgery for AVM: the use of SF2 from fibroblasts as a predictive factor].,"PURPOSE: To identify SF2 as a prognostic factor of late complications from radiosurgery in patients treated for AVM. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five patients with AVM treated in three canadian institutions and who suffered clinically significant neurological sequelaes secondary to radiosurgery were identified. Their fibroblasts were cultured and their radiation sensitivity tested to determine the SF2 for each patient. RESULTS: Patients who developed a neurological complication from radionecrosis, secondary to radiosurgery had an SF2 different than the two control patients with AVM and no complications and also from a group of five cancer patients without late radiation complications (P = 0.005). CONCLUSION: Radiosurgery is an elective procedure. The identification of a subgroup of patients who are radiosensitive and at a higher risk of radiation induced complications can allow the treatment team to reduce the risk of such complications. SF2 as a new predictive factor should be incorporated in predictive models of risk from treatment of AVM by radiosurgery.

25614948,Seizure and anticonvulsant outcomes following stereotactic radiosurgery for intracranial arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECT: Epilepsy associated with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) has an unclear course after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Neither the risks of persistent seizures nor the requirement for postoperative antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are well defined. METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective review of all patients with AVMs who underwent SRS at the University of Virginia Health System from 1989 to 2012. Seizure status was categorized according to a modified Engel classification. The effects of demographic, AVM-related, and SRS treatment factors on seizure outcomes were evaluated with logistic regression analysis. Changes in AED status were evaluated using McNemar's test. RESULTS: Of the AVM patients with pre- or post-SRS seizures, 73 with pre-SRS epilepsy had evaluable data for subsequent analysis. The median patient age was 37 years (range 5-69 years), and the median follow-up period was 65.6 months (range 12-221 months). Sixty-five patients (89%) achieved seizure remission (Engel Class IA or IB outcome). Patients presenting with simple partial or secondarily generalized seizures were more likely to achieve Engel Class I outcome (p = 0.045). Twenty-one (33%) of 63 patients tapered off of pre-SRS AEDs. The incidence of freedom from AED therapy increased significantly after SRS (p < 0.001, McNemar's test). Of the Engel Class IA patients who continued AED therapy, 54% had patent AVM nidi, whereas only 19% continued AED therapy with complete AVM obliteration (p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic radiosurgery is an effective treatment for long-term AVM-related epilepsy. Seizure-free patients on continued AED therapy were more likely to have residual AVM nidi.

11063112,Occlusive hyperemia: a radiosurgical phenomenon?,"OBJECTIVE: Causes of neurological deficits after arteriovenous malformation (AVM) radiosurgery, including hemorrhage, radiation injury, and delayed cyst formation, are described. CONCEPT: Occlusive hyperemia has been described as a reason for neurological deterioration after AVM resection. Thrombosis of draining veins or dural sinuses is thought to cause postoperative bleeding or neurological deficits secondary to venous hypertension. In a similar manner, local hemodynamic changes can occur in the brain adjacent to an AVM after radiosurgery if venous outflow is obstructed. Two patients are presented whose cases demonstrate this phenomenon. CONCLUSION: Patients can experience clinical worsening after AVM radiosurgery from premature thrombosis of draining veins. Local hemodynamic changes could explain why imaging changes thought to be radiation related occur more frequently after radiosurgery of AVMs than of tumors.",2000 Nov,2000,Neurosurgery,47,5,1178-82; discussion 1182-4,eng,False,10.1097/00006123-200011000-00033,Case Reports;Journal Article,Adult;Brain/*blood supply;Cerebral Veins/*pathology;Hemodynamics;Humans;Hyperemia/*diagnosis;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Postoperative Complications/*diagnosis;Radiosurgery/*instrumentation;Venous Thrombosis/*diagnosis,

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the records of 1232 patients with AVMs who underwent SRS at our center between 1987 and 2017. We identified 10 patients who had SRS for multiple AVMs (total of 25). Eight patients presented with intracranial hemorrhage before SRS. Four patients had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. A Spetzler-Martin grade I AVM was diagnosed in 11 AVMs, grade II in 7, grade III in 6, and grade IV in 1 AVM. The median maximum diameter was 12 mm, the median target volume was 1.1 cm(3), and the median margin dose was 20 Gy. Twenty-four AVMs were treated with single-session SRS, and 1 AVM was treated with volume-staged SRS. RESULTS: The angiographic complete obliteration rate of each AVM was 18.2%, 58.0%, and 66.4% at 3, 5, and 7 years, respectively. The angiographic complete obliteration rate of all treated AVMs in each patient was 11.1%, 51.4%, and 51.4% at 3, 5, and 7 years, respectively. In multivariate analysis, higher marginal dose (≥18 Gy, P = 0.031) was significantly associated with complete obliteration of AVMs. After obliteration of all their AVMs was confirmed no patient bled. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with complex multiple AVMs often presented with a brain hemorrhage. Reduction in bleeding risk after SRS requires complete obliteration that is more likely if the initial AVM margin dose is ≥18 Gy for each AVM.",2020 Dec,2020,World neurosurgery,144,,e244-e252,eng,False,S1878-8750(20)31866-0;10.1016/j.wneu.2020.08.099;S1878-8750(20)31866-0;10.1016/j.wneu.2020.08.099,Journal Article,Adult;Aged;Arteriovenous Fistula/*surgery;Child;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/*methods;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult,AVM;Arteriovenous malformations;Gamma knife;Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia;Intracerebral hemorrhage;Multiple;Stereotactic radiosurgery

16037682,Intracranial arteriovenous malformations treated utilizing a linear accelerator-based patient rotator or commercially available radiosurgery system.,"PURPOSE: To report a single-institution experience with intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) treated utilizing a linear accelerator-based patient rotator (PR) or BrainLAB (BL) radiosurgery system (BrainLAB AG, Heimstetten, Germany). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Since 1989, 84 evaluable patients were treated. PR patients (n = 45) were planned/localized on the basis of biplane angiography and treated between 1989 and 2000. BL patients (n = 39) were planned/localized on the basis of CT/MRI and treated since 2000. Kaplan-Meier analyses of survival, nidus obliteration (NO), and any radiographic improvement were undertaken with Cox regression of dose and volume effects. RESULTS: No significant complication, survival, previous embolization incidence, AVM location or size differences existed between BL/PR patients. The groups differed significantly in prescribed dose (PR: 16.2 Gy, BL: 17.3 Gy, p = 0.004) and isodose (PR: 62%, BL: 79%, p < 0.0001). Estimated 2-year NO rate was 87% for BL patients, 12% for PR patients (p < 0.0001). Ultimate PR NO rate was 67% at 6 years. Dose (p = 0.037) and isodose (p = 0.014) significantly affected PR NO outcome; volume was of borderline significance (p = 0.069). No factors significantly affected BL outcome. Analyses of small (< or = 4.0 cm3), high-dose (> or = 17.0 Gy) PR patients (PR1 group) vs. BL patients still demonstrated greater NO (p = 0.04) and radiographic improvement (p = 0.0004) rates for the BL group. PR1 patients had a 76% 3-year NO rate. CONCLUSIONS: BL-based radiosurgery achieved a high NO rate, the PR method did not.

29752992,Radiosurgery reduces plasma levels of angiogenic factors in brain arteriovenous malformation patients.,"PURPOSE: Aberrant expression of angiogenic factors has been anecdotally documented in brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM) nidus vessels; however, no data is available on the effect of radiosurgery on the levels of angiogenic factors in AVM patients. We sought to determine the plasma contents of VEGF, TGF-β, Ang-2 and bFGF in 28 brain AVM patients at baseline and post radiosurgery and further analyzed the relationship between plasma contents of these angiogenic factors with clinicopathologic variables of these patients. METHODS: We enrolled brain AVM patients who underwent Cyberknife radiosurgery at our hospital between January 2014 and December 2015. Brain AVM was confirmed by cerebral angiography and radiosurgery was performed with Cyberknife irradiation. Plasma contents of VEGF, TGF-β, Ang-2 and bFGF were analyzed using commercially available enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) kits. RESULTS: The baseline plasma VEGF content was 222.63 pg/mL (range 43.25-431.25 pg/mL). At three months post surgery, there was a significant -34.29% decline in plasma VEGF content versus baseline (P = 0.000). Furthermore, the median baseline plasma VEGF levels were higher in brain AVM with a nidus volume ≥ 10 cm(3)) than those with a nidus volume < 10 cm(3) [median(IQR) 293.5 (186.5,359.25) vs. 202 (59.75, 270.75) pg/mL, P = 0.057]. The baseline plasma TGF-β content was 556.17 pg/mL (range 44.44-1486.11 pg/mL) and there was a significant -27.47% decline in plasma TGF-β content at 3 months post radiosurgery versus baseline (P = 0.015). Moreover, the baseline plasma ANG-2 content was 214.27 pg/mL (range 77.14-453.76 pg/mL). There was an immediate and significant -12.47% decline in plasma ANG-2 content post surgery versus baseline (P = 0.002). At three months post surgery, the plasma ANG-2 content still remained significantly depressed versus baseline (P = 0.002). In addition, the baseline plasma bFGF content was 9.17 pg/mL (range 3.67-36.78 pg/mL). No significant difference in plasma bFGF content was observed immediately post surgery and 3 months post surgery versus baseline (P = 0.05).

30641831,Stereotactic radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations of the basal ganglia and thalamus: an international multicenter study.,"OBJECTIVE: Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the basal ganglia (BG) and thalamus are associated with elevated risks of both hemorrhage if left untreated and neurological morbidity after resection. Therefore, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has become a mainstay in the management of these lesions, although its safety and efficacy remain incompletely understood. The aim of this retrospective multicenter cohort study was to evaluate the outcomes of SRS for BG and thalamic AVMs and determine predictors of successful endpoints and adverse radiation effects. METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed data on patients with BG or thalamic AVMs who had undergone SRS at eight institutions participating in the International Gamma Knife Research Foundation (IGKRF) from 1987 to 2014. Favorable outcome was defined as AVM obliteration, no post-SRS hemorrhage, and no permanently symptomatic radiation-induced changes (RICs). Multivariable models were developed to identify independent predictors of outcome. RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 363 patients with BG or thalamic AVMs. The mean AVM volume and SRS margin dose were 3.8 cm3 and 20.7 Gy, respectively. The mean follow-up duration was 86.5 months. Favorable outcome was achieved in 58.5% of patients, including obliteration in 64.8%, with rates of post-SRS hemorrhage and permanent RIC in 11.3% and 5.6% of patients, respectively. Independent predictors of favorable outcome were no prior AVM embolization (p = 0.011), a higher margin dose (p = 0.008), and fewer isocenters (p = 0.044). CONCLUSIONS: SRS is the preferred intervention for the majority of BG and thalamic AVMs. Patients with morphologically compact AVMs that have not been previously embolized are more likely to have a favorable outcome, which may be related to the use of a higher margin dose.",2020 Jan 1,2020,Journal of neurosurgery,132,1,122-131,eng,True,10.3171/2018.8.JNS182106;10.3171/2018.8.JNS182106,Journal Article;Multicenter Study,"Adolescent;Adult;Basal Ganglia/blood supply/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Embolization, Therapeutic;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Aneurysm/complications/therapy;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/diagnostic;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Neuroimaging;Postoperative Hemorrhage/etiology;Radiation Dosage;Radiation Injuries/etiology;Radiosurgery/adverse effects/*methods;Retrospective Studies;Thalamus/blood supply/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",AVM = arteriovenous malformation;BG = basal ganglia;DSA = digital subtraction angiography;EBRT = external beam radiation therapy;Gamma Knife;IGKRF = International Gamma Knife Research Foundation;RIC = radiation-induced change;SM = Spetzler-Martin;SRS = stereotactic radiosurgery;VRAS = Virginia Radiosurgery AVM Scale;basal ganglia;intracranial arteriovenous malformations;intracranial hemorrhages;mRBAS = modified radiosurgery-based AVM score;radiosurgery;stereotactic radiosurgery;stroke;thalamus;vascular disorders;vascular malformations
25635888,Draining vein shielding in intracranial arteriovenous malformations during gamma-knife: a new way of preventing post gamma-knife edema and hemorrhage.,"BACKGROUND: Following gamma knife (GK) therapy for intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), obliteration of the nidus occurs over several years. During this period, complications like rebleeding have been attributed to early draining vein occlusion. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate if shielding the draining vein(s) during GK therapy prevents early draining vein obliteration and complications following GK therapy. METHODS: This was a nonrandomized case-control study over 5 years (January 2009-February 2014) and included patients with intracranial AVM who underwent GK therapy at our center. All patients who underwent draining vein shielding by the senior author (D.A.) were included in the test group, and patients who did not undergo draining vein shielding were put in the control group. Patients were followed up for at least 6 months (and every 6 months thereafter) clinically as well as radiologically with computed tomography head scans/magnetic resonance imaging brain scans to check for postradiosurgery imaging (PRI) changes. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-five patients were included in this study, of which 96 were in the control group and 89 were in the test group. Both groups were well matched in demographics, comorbidities, adjuvant treatment, angioarchitecture, and radiation dosing. Because of shielding, the test group patients received significantly less radiation to the draining vein than the control group (P = .001). On follow-up, a significantly lower number of patients in the test group had new neurological deficits (P = .001), intracranial hemorrhage (P = .03), and PRI changes (P = .002).

23530863,Radiosurgery for patients with unruptured intracranial arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECT: The appropriate management of unruptured intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) remains controversial. In the present study, the authors evaluate the radiographic and clinical outcomes of radiosurgery for a large cohort of patients with unruptured AVMs. METHODS: From a prospective database of 1204 cases of AVMs involving patients treated with radiosurgery at their institution, the authors identified 444 patients without evidence of rupture prior to radiosurgery. The patients' mean age was 36.9 years, and 50% were male. The mean AVM nidus volume was 4.2 cm(3), 13.5% of the AVMs were in a deep location, and 44.4% were at least Spetzler-Martin Grade III. The median radiosurgical prescription dose was 20 Gy. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to determine risk factors associated with obliteration, postradiosurgery hemorrhage, radiation-induced changes, and postradiosurgery cyst formation. The mean duration of radiological and clinical follow-up was 76 months and 86 months, respectively. RESULTS: The cumulative AVM obliteration rate was 62%, and the postradiosurgery annual hemorrhage rate was 1.6%. Radiation-induced changes were symptomatic in 13.7% and permanent in 2.0% of patients. The statistically significant independent positive predictors of obliteration were no preradiosurgery embolization (p < 0.001), increased prescription dose (p < 0.001), single draining vein (p < 0.001), radiological presence of radiation-induced changes (p = 0.004), and lower Spetzler-Martin grade (p = 0.016). Increased volume and higher Pittsburgh radiosurgery-based AVM score were predictors of postradiosurgery hemorrhage in the univariate analysis only. Clinical deterioration occurred in 30 patients (6.8%), more commonly in patients with postradiosurgery hemorrhage (p = 0.018).

33214183,Radiation-Induced Imaging Changes and Cerebral Edema following Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Brain AVMs.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: T2 signal and FLAIR changes in patients undergoing stereotactic radiosurgery for brain AVMs may occur posttreatment and could result in adverse radiation effects. We aimed to evaluate outcomes in patients with these imaging changes, the frequency and degree of this response, and factors associated with it. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Through this retrospective cohort study, consecutive patients treated with stereotactic radiosurgery for brain AVMs who had at least 1 year of follow-up MR imaging were identified. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate predictors of outcomes. RESULTS: One-hundred-sixty AVMs were treated in 148 patients (mean, 35.6 years of age), including 42 (26.2%) pediatric AVMs. The mean MR imaging follow-up was 56.5 months. The median Spetzler-Martin grade was III. The mean maximal AVM diameter was 2.8 cm, and the mean AVM target volume was 7.4 mL. The median radiation dose was 16.5 Gy. New T2 signal and FLAIR hyperintensity were noted in 40% of AVMs. T2 FLAIR volumes at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months were, respectively, 4.04, 55.47, 56.42, 48.06, and 29.38 mL Radiation-induced neurologic symptoms were encountered in 34.4%. In patients with radiation-induced imaging changes, 69.2% had new neurologic symptoms versus 9.5% of patients with no imaging changes (P = .0001). Imaging changes were significantly associated with new neurologic findings (P < .001). Larger AVM maximal diameter (P = .04) and the presence of multiple feeding arteries (P = .01) were associated with radiation-induced imaging changes.

18642653,Radiosurgery from the brain to the spine: 20 years experience.,"INTRODUCTION: Radiosurgery evolved from brain to spine. Mechanical and computer advances in linear accelerator (LINAC) radiosurgery apply precise single/fractional stereotactic radiation to multiple pathologies. METHODS: During a 10-year span the senior author used proton-beam radiosurgery in over 300 lesions, followed by gamma-knife, adapted and dedicated LINACS, including cyber-knife, in another 700 patients. The last 10 years, experience was accumulated with the Novalis in over 3,000 patients. Novalis uses a beam-shaper in a high-speed delivery LINAC. It operates using conventional circular arc, conformal static beam, dynamic conformal or intensity modulated modes. Patients treated with Novalis at the UCLA since 1997 were evaluated regarding effectiveness, complications and failure. These results were compared with previous 1997 data. RESULTS: Over 4,000 patients with trigeminal neuralgia/intractable pain, arteriovenous malformations/angiomas, metastases, ependymomas, gliomas, meningiomas hemangiopericytomas, schwannomas, adenomas, hemangioblastomas, and chordoma were treated. Spinal lesions were treated with frameless stereotaxis and on-line precision checks. Treatment was expeditious, comfortable and with reduced complications. Success is similar or superior to published data. Reduced treatment time of complex lesions and highly homogeneous dose compares favorably to other radiosurgery. CONCLUSIONS: The senior author's experience validates the novel shaped-beam approach. Long-term follow-up supports safety and effectiveness and capability to treat brain and spine.",2008,2008,Acta neurochirurgica.

37486910,Management outcomes of peripontine arteriovenous malformation patients presenting with trigeminal neuralgia.,"OBJECTIVE: Trigeminal neuralgia as the presenting symptom of brain arteriovenous malformation (bAVM) has been rarely reported. Treatment of reported cases has been skewed toward surgery for these scarce, deeply located bAVMs. Here, the authors report their management and outcomes of bAVM patients presenting with ipsilateral trigeminal neuralgia (TN) at their institution. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study. The authors' institutional bAVM database was queried for non-hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia bAVMs in pontine, cistern, brainstem, trigeminal nerve, or tentorial locations. Patients with complete data were included in a search for trigeminal neuralgia or ""facial pain"" as the presenting symptom with TN being on the same side as the bAVM. Demographics, TN and bAVM characteristics, management strategies, and outcomes of bAVM and TN management were analyzed. RESULTS: Fifty-seven peripontine bAVMs were identified; 8 (14.0%) of these bAVMs were discovered because of ipsilateral TN, including 4 patients (50%) with facial pain in the V2 distribution. Five patients (62.5%) were treated with carbamazepine as the initial medical therapy, 2 (25%) underwent multiple rhizotomies, and 1 (12.5%) underwent microvascular decompression. None of the patients with TN-associated bAVMs presented with hemorrhage, compared with 25 patients (51%) with bAVMs that were not associated with TN (p < 0.01). TN-associated bAVMs were overall smaller than non-TN-associated bAVMs, but the difference was not statistically significant (1.71 cm vs 2.22 cm, p = 0.117), and the Spetzler-Martin grades were similar. Six patients (75%) underwent radiosurgery to the bAVM (mean dose 1800 cGy, mean target volume 0.563 cm3) and had complete resolution of TN symptoms (100%). The mean time from radiosurgery to TN resolution was 193 (range 21-360) days, and 83.3% of treated TN-associated bAVMs were obliterated via radiosurgery. Two patients (12.5%) were recommended for conservative management, with one undergoing subsequent rhizotomies and another patient died of hemorrhage during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: TN-associated bAVM is a rare condition with limited evidence for management guidance. Radiosurgery can be safe and effective in achieving durable TN control in patients with TN-associated bAVMs. Despite their deep location and unruptured presentation, obliteration can reach 83.3% with radiosurgery.",2024 Feb 1,2024,Journal of neurosurgery,140,2,515-521,eng,False,10.3171/2023.5.JNS23771;10.3171/2023.5.JNS23771,Journal Article,Humans;*Trigeminal Neuralgia/etiology/surgery;Treatment Outcome;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/surgery;Retrospective Studies;Facial Pain/etiology;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects;Hemorrhage,brain arteriovenous malformation;pain;radiosurgery;trigeminal neuralgia;vascular disorders
31096235,Re-Evaluating Clinical Outcomes for AVM Stereotactic Radiosurgery.,"Traditional outcome measures after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) have focused predominantly on angiographic obliteration and general neurologic complications. Several grading scales attempting to predict the outcome for specific patients have previously been proposed and validated, and are outlined here. These have largely been based on both AVM and patient characteristics and attempt to predict obliteration. However, the most practical and clinically oriented goal in the management of AVMs is the prospective avoidance of neurological sequelae manifesting in the form of stroke or death, regardless of AVM obliteration. Long-term outcomes following SRS have demonstrated stroke or death rates of 1.5-2.0% per year for the first 5 years after SRS, followed by 0.2-0.4% annual risk thereafter. This focus on the avoidance of stroke or death is additionally crucial for direct comparisons to non-interventional natural history data. Here, we discuss the history of outcomes data on radiosurgery for AVMs and propose a re-evaluation of clinical outcome that is of most utility to the patient.",2019,2019,Progress in neurological surgery,34,,267-272,eng,False,10.1159/000493073;000493073;10.1159/000493073,Journal Article;Review,"Arteriovenous Fistula/*radiotherapy/surgery;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*radiotherapy/surgery;Outcome Assessment, Health Care/*standards;Radiosurgery/*methods",
16475146,MR angiography fusion technique for treatment planning of intracranial arteriovenous malformations.,"PURPOSE: To develop an image fusion technique using elliptical centric contrast-enhanced (CE) MR angiography (MRA) and three-dimensional (3D) time-of-flight (TOF) acquisitions for radiosurgery treatment planning of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: CE and 3D-TOF MR angiograms with disparate in-plane fields of view (FOVs) were acquired, followed by k-space reformatting to provide equal voxel dimensions. Spatial domain addition was performed to provide a third, fused data volume. Spatial distortion was evaluated on an MRA phantom and provided slice-dependent and global distortion along the three physical dimensions of the MR scanner. In vivo validation was performed on 10 patients with intracranial AVMs prior to their conventional angiogram on the day of gamma knife radiosurgery. RESULTS: Spatial distortion in the phantom within a volume of 14 x 14 x 3.2 cm(3) was less than +/-1 mm (+/-1 standard deviation (SD)) for CE and 3D-TOF data sets. Fused data volumes were successfully generated for all 10 patients. CONCLUSION: Image fusion can be used to obtain high-resolution CE-MRA images of intracranial AVMs while keeping the fiducial markers needed for gamma knife radiosurgery planning. The spatial fidelity of these data is within the tolerance acceptable for daily quality control (QC) purposes and gamma knife treatment planning.",2006 Mar,2006,Journal of magnetic resonance imaging : JMRI,23,3,361-9,eng,False,10.1002/jmri.20519,Journal Article,"Adult;Algorithms;Contrast Media;Female;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*pathology/surgery;Magnetic Resonance Angiography/*methods;Male;Middle Aged;*Patient Care Planning;Phantoms, Imaging;Radiosurgery",

We present the 15-year course of a pediatric patient, who initially presented at age 5 with a thalamic cavernous malformation and was treated with radiosurgery, and then subsequently developed a thalamic de novo bAVM immediately adjacent to the initial lesion location, discovered 2 years later. Treatment of the bAVM entailed two transarterial embolizations and one radiosurgery session which ultimately led to complete angiographic resolution. Finally, this patient's course was complicated by intraparenchymal hemorrhage and acute obstructive hydrocephalus, and further imaging revealed two newly formed cavernous malformations, also associated with the initial lesion's location, that have remained stable since their formation. This case likely represents the second-hit model for the formation of vascular malformations, as sparsely supported by the current literature. According to this, genetically aberrant, yet quiescent, brain areas might promote the de novo formation of vascular malformations after brain injury, including radiation.",2022 Aug,2022,The neuroradiology journal,35,4,533-538,eng,False,10.1177/19714009211059115;10.1177_19714009211059115;10.1177/19714009211059115,Journal Article,"Child;Child, Preschool;*Hemangioma, Cavernous, Central Nervous System;Humans;*Hydrocephalus;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations;*Radiosurgery;Thalamus",(MeSH): arteriovenous malformation;de novo;familial cerebral cavernous malformation

The advantages, risks and failures of this approach are presented and discussed. METHODS: Gamma knife radiosurgery was performed on 63 children aged < or =16 years. Haemorrhage was the clinical onset in 50 out of 63 cases. The mean pre-GK cAVM volume was 3.8 cm(3). Fifty-eight out of 63 cAVMs were Spetzler-Martin grades I-III. Most lesions (47 out of 63) were in eloquent or deep-seated brain regions. CONCLUSION: Gamma knife radiosurgery-related complications occurred in 2 out of 47 cases with an available follow-up (1 had transient and 1 permanent morbidity). No bleeding occurred during the latency period. In 39 children with >36-month follow-up, complete cAVM occlusion was angiographically documented in 31, with a 3- and 4-year actuarial obliteration rate of 72 and 77% respectively. High rates of complete obliteration and very low frequency of permanent morbidity with no bleeding during the latency period encourage widespread application of GKR in the treatment of pediatric cAVMs.",2005 Apr,2005,Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for,21,4,301-7; discussion 308,eng,False,10.1007/s00381-004-1049-5,Clinical Trial;Comparative Study;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Cerebral Angiography/methods;Cerebral Hemorrhage/surgery;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/physiopathology/*surgery;Male;Postoperative Complications;Radiosurgery/*methods;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome",

Histological, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural characteristics of this spindle-shaped cell population in the irradiated AVMs were reminiscent of those described as myofibroblasts in wound healing processes and pathological fibromatoses. These modified fibroblasts have contractile capacity, therefore this might contribute to the vessel occlusion, shrinking process and final volume reduction of AVMs after GKRS.

METHODS: A total of 301 radiosurgical procedures for 277 cerebral AVMs were performed between December 1988 and December 1999. Two hundred seventy-eight lesions in 254 patients who were treated with GKS from May 1992 to December 1999 were analyzed. Several clinical and radiological parameters were evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: The total obliteration rate for the cases with an adequate radiological follow up of more than 2 years was 78.9%. In multivariate analysis, maximum diameter, angiographically delineated shape of the AVM nidus, and the number of draining veins significantly influenced the result of radiosurgery. In addition, margin radiation dose, Spetzler-Martin grade, and the flow pattern of the AVM nidus also had some influence on the outcome. In addition to the size, topography, and radiosurgical parameters of AVMs, it would seem to be necessary to consider the angioarchitectural and hemodynamic aspects to select proper candidates for radiosurgery.",2000 Dec,2000,Journal of neurosurgery,93 Suppl 3,,96-101,eng,True,10.3171/sup.2000.93.supplement3.0096,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Angiography;Male;Middle Aged;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome",
11110543,Brain arteriovenous malformations: assessment with dynamic MR digital subtraction angiography.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Conventional catheter angiography (CCA) is the current reference standard for the diagnosis, assessment, and management of pial brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). The purpose of this study was to develop an MR angiographic technique that produces dynamic images comparable to those provided by CCA and to apply the technique to the investigation of pial brain AVMs. METHODS: Twenty patients with brain AVMs referred for stereotactic radiosurgery were recruited. All patients had CCA performed on a 1.5-T superconducting system. Sixty images were obtained at a rate of one image per second. Slices were orientated to produce Towne, lateral, and anteroposterior projections. A set of mask images was taken and then a series during the passage of a bolus of contrast material. MR examinations were assessed independently by neuroradiologists blinded to the conventional catheter angiographic findings. RESULTS: The nidus of the AVMs was depicted in 19 of the 20 patients, and correlation with CCA was excellent for measurements of maximum diameter. Venous drainage was correctly assessed in 18 of 19 cases. CONCLUSION: MR digital subtraction angiography shows promise as a noninvasive, dynamic angiographic tool for planning stereotactic radiosurgery of AVMs already delineated by catheter angiography. At present, it suffers from temporal and spatial resolution, which impede the assessment of some brain AVMs.",2000 Nov-Dec,2000,AJNR.

28830253,Evaluation of obliteration of arteriovenous malformations after stereotactic radiosurgery with arterial spin labeling MR imaging.,"PURPOSE: Complete obliteration of treated arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) can be diagnosed only by confirming the disappearance of arterio-venous (A-V) shunts with invasive catheter angiography. The authors evaluated whether non-invasive arterial spin labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging can be used to diagnose the obliteration of AVMs facilitate the diagnosis of AVM obliteration after treatment with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seven patients with a cerebral AVM treated by SRS were followed up with ASL images taken with a 3T-MR unit, and received digital subtraction angiography (DSA) after the AVM had disappeared on ASL images. Three patients among the seven received DSA also after the postradiosurgical AVM had disappeared on conventional MR images but A-V shunt was residual on ASL images. Four patients among the seven received contrast-enhanced (CE) MR imaging around the same period as DSA. RESULTS: ASL images could visualize postradiosurgical residual A-V shunts clearly. In all seven patients, DSA after the disappearance of A-V shunts on ASL images demonstrated no evidence of A-V shunts. In all three patients, DSA after the AVM had disappeared on conventional MR images but not on ASL images demonstrated residual A-V shunt. CE MR findings of AVMs treated by SRS did not correspond with DSA findings in three out of four patients. CONCLUSIONS: Findings of radiosurgically treated AVMs on ASL images corresponded with those on DSA. The results of this study suggest that ASL imaging can be utilized to follow up AVMs after SRS and to decide their obliteration facilitate to decide the precise timing of catheter angiography for the final diagnosis of AVM obliteration after SRS.",2017 Dec,2017,British journal of neurosurgery,31,6,641-647,eng,False,10.1080/02688697.2017.1365818;10.1080/02688697.2017.1365818,Comparative Study;Evaluation Study;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Angiography, Digital Subtraction/methods;Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/pathology/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Angiography/methods;Male;Middle Aged;Postoperative Care;ROC Curve;Radiosurgery/*methods;Retrospective Studies;Young Adult",Arterial spin labeling;arteriovenous malformation;magnetic resonance imaging;obliteration;stereotactic radiosurgery

On his first-year follow-up perilesional edema was observed for which the patient received steroid treatment, but the patient did not show any benefit from it. In the cases of steroid resistant perilesional edemas, bevacizumab can be used for reducing symptoms and even radiological perilesional edema as well. RESULTS: In our case, we have seen the effect of bevacizumab for symptomatic perilesional edema in a AVM patient after SRS treatment after radiological / neurological recovery. Our patient's headaches decreased rapidly after 2 days after treatment and was able to mobilize himself after 2 months but total resolution of symptoms and radiological findings observed after 1,5 years.

23440432,Prospective comparison of late 3T MRI with conventional angiography in evaluating the patency of cerebral arteriovenous malformations treated with stereotactic radiosurgery.,"INTRODUCTION: Risk of further haemorrhage in patients suffering from arteriovenous malformation (AVM) would be eliminated only if complete obliteration of the AVM is obtained. Therefore, these patients frequently need long-term follow-up. Conventional catheter angiography (CCA) with a risk of 0.5 %.to 1.6 % of significant neurological complications has traditionally been used for this purpose. However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3T may be a safer alternative. The aim of this study was to evaluate if MRI at 3T can accurately evaluate closure of AVM in 2 years after stereotactic radiosurgery. METHODS: Twenty-three patients with both MRI at 3T and a CCA study were examined. The residual AVMs were evaluated by MRI at 3T against CCA in a prospective study. RESULTS: The time interval between radiosurgery and neuroimaging was on average of 25 months (range, 15-30 months) for MRI study and 33 months (range, 25-46 months) for CCA study. Ten patients showed closure of the AVM on MRI, all of which were confirmed on CCA.

37993730,Dynamic (live) 3D roadmap as navigational tool in multiplug brain arteriovenous malformation embolization: technical note.,"PURPOSE: Treatment of brain arteriovenous malformation (bAVM) includes microsurgical excision, stereotactic radiosurgery, endovascular embolization, or combination. With bAVM embolization, complete angiographic obliteration ranges from 12.5 to 51%, and higher total occlusion rate is seen in SM grades I to III, ranging from 96 to 100%. METHODS: In this paper, we illustrate the use of 3D rotational angiography and dynamic (live) 3D roadmap functions in endovascular treatment of bAVM. A single dynamic 3D roadmap or two dynamic 3D roadmaps obtained help tremendously in navigation of microcatheters and wires along the parent artery and bAVM feeders. RESULTS: This method eliminates the need for repeated 2D angiograms and roadmaps for new working projections every time the C-arm position is changed for cannulation of different feeders, thereby reducing radiation dose. No instances of misalignment error, vascular perforation, or thromboembolic phenomena were observed in the 21 embolization cases performed within the previous 2 years while utilizing this feature. CONCLUSION: The dynamic 3D roadmap is an extremely useful tool for multiple-feeder cannulation, by reducing the use of multiple 2D angiograms, providing intraprocedural live and adjustable 3D roadmap for better mental orientation to angioarchitecture of the bAVM, which further aids in the overall complete angiographic obliteration rate of bAVM in a single session especially in multiplug embolization technique.",2024 Jan,2024,Neuroradiology,66,1,129-133,eng,False,10.1007/s00234-023-03250-6;10.1007/s00234-023-03250-6;10.1007/s00234-023-03250-6,Journal Article,"Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/therapy;Brain;*Embolization, Therapeutic/methods;Cerebral Angiography/methods;Catheterization;*Radiosurgery;Treatment Outcome;Retrospective Studies",3D rotational angiography overlay;Arteriovenous malformations;Dynamic(live) 3D roadmap;Embolization;Multiplug technique
28323192,Multimodality Management of Spetzler-Martin Grade 3 Brain Arteriovenous Malformations with Subgroup Analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: Spetzler-Martin grade 3 (SM3) lesions entail 4 distinct subtypes described based on size, eloquence, and deep venous drainage (3A-3D). The ideal management of each is contentious, and the results of A Randomized Trial of Unruptured Brain AVMs (ARUBA) introduced additional controversy and attention toward management strategies of unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 114 patients with treated SM3 bAVMs, including both ruptured and unruptured lesions. Primary outcomes included modified Rankin score at most recent follow-up, angiographic cure, and permanent treatment-related complications (morbidity). Other outcomes included mortality, bAVM recurrence or rebleed, and transient treatment-related complications. We used univariate and multivariate modeling to determine whether any specific features were predictive of outcomes. For unruptured bAVMs, an ""ARUBA eligible"" subgroup analysis was performed. We also reviewed the literature on management of ruptured and unruptured SM3 bAVMs. RESULTS: Of the 114 identified SM3 bAVMs, 40% were unruptured. Most (43.5%) lesions in the unruptured group were type 3C, whereas most ruptured bAVMs (66.2%) were type 3A. Unruptured lesions were mostly managed with radiosurgery (47.8%) and ruptured ones with preoperative embolization and surgery (36.7%). Surgical intervention was predictive of angiographic cure in multivariate modeling, even after controlling for ≥2 years of follow-up, although associated with a slightly higher rate of morbidity. Focal neurological deficit was the only predictor of a worse (modified Rankin score ≥2) functional outcome in follow-up for unruptured bAVMs. For ruptured bAVMs, superficial and cerebellar locations were predictive of better outcomes in multivariate models, in the absence of a focal neurological deficit at presentation and new after surgery deficit. ARUBA SM3 bAVMs specifically underwent more embolization as a monotherapy and less microsurgical resection than the present series. CONCLUSIONS: In spite of a heterogeneous array of angioarchitectural and anatomic features, SM3 bAVMs can be treated safely and effectively with surgery and radiosurgery either without or with pretreatment embolization. Ruptured lesions are more often type 3A, with smaller nidus, deep brain location, and deep venous drainage. Focal neurological deficit predicts worse clinical outcomes. Contemporary multimodality management of SM3 bAVMs is not adequately represented in the results of ARUBA, likely due to differences in treatment strategies.",2017 Jun,2017,World neurosurgery,102,,263-274,eng,True,S1878-8750(17)30358-3;10.1016/j.wneu.2017.03.046;S1878-8750(17)30358-3;10.1016/j.wneu.2017.03.046,Journal Article,"Adult;*Disease Management;Drainage/methods;Embolization, Therapeutic;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*classification/*therapy;Male;Middle Aged;Neurosurgical Procedures;Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Statistics, Nonparametric;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",ARUBA;Brain arteriovenous malformation (bAVM);Grade 3
19165066,Obliteration dynamics in cerebral arteriovenous malformations after cyberknife radiosurgery: quantification with sequential nidus volumetry and 3-tesla 3-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the time-dependent obliteration of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (cAVM) after CyberKnife radiosurgery (CKRS) (Accuray, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) by means of sequential 3-T, 3-dimensional (3D), time-of-flight (TOF) magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and volumetry of the arteriovenous malformation (AVM) nidus. METHODS: In this prospective study, 3D TOF MRA was performed on 20 patients with cAVMs treated by single-fraction CKRS. Three-dimensional TOF MRA was performed on a 3-T, 32-channel magnetic resonance scanner (Magnetom TIM Trio; Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) with isotropic voxel size at a spatial resolution of 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.6 mm3. The time-dependent relative decay of the transnidal blood flow evidenced by 3D TOF MRA was referred to as ""obliteration dynamics."" Volumetry of the nidus size was performed with OsiriX imaging software (OsiriX Foundation, Geneva, Switzerland). All patients had 3 to 4 follow-up examinations at 3- to 6-month intervals over a minimum follow-up period of 9 months. Subtotal obliteration was determined if the residual nidus volume was 5% or less of the initial nidus volume. Stata/IC software (Version 10.0; Stata Corp., College Station, TX) was used for statistical analysis and to identify potential factors of AVM obliteration. RESULTS: Regarding their clinical status, case history, and pretreatments, the participants of this study represent difficult-to-treat cAVM patients. The median nidus volume was 1.8 mL (range, 0.4-12.5 mL); the median minimum dose prescribed to the nidus was 22 Gy (range, 16-24 Gy) delivered to the 67% isodose line (range, 55-80%). CKRS was well tolerated, with complications in 2 patients. No further hemorrhages occurred after RS, except 1 small and clinically inapparent incident. The median follow-up period after RS was 25.0 months (range, 11.7-36.8 months). After RS, a statistically significant obliteration was observed in all patients. However, the obliteration dynamics of the cAVMs showed a pronounced variability, with 2 types of post-therapeutic behavior identified. cAVMs of Group A showed a faster reduction of transnidal blood flow than cAVMs in Group B. The median time to subtotal obliteration was 23.8 months for all patients, 11.6 months for patients in Group A, and 27.8 months for patients in Group B (P = 0.05). Logistic regression analysis revealed dose homogeneity and the circumscribed isodose to be the only variables (P < 0.01) associated with the obliteration dynamics in this study. The cumulative complete angiographic obliteration rate was 67% (95% confidence interval, 32-95%) 2 years after RS. CONCLUSION: The use of sequential 3D TOF MRA at 3 T and nidus volumetry enables a noninvasive quantitative assessment of the dynamic obliteration process induced by CKRS in cAVMs. This method may be helpful to identify factors related to AVM obliteration after RS when larger patient cohorts become available.",2009 Feb,2009,Neurosurgery,64,2 Suppl,A102-9,eng,False,10.1227/01.NEU.0000339201.31176.C9;00006123-200902001-00016;10.1227/01.NEU.0000339201.31176.C9,Clinical Trial;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Brain/*blood supply;Cerebrovascular Circulation;Female;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional/*methods;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*pathology/*surgery;*Magnetic Resonance Angiography;Male;Middle Aged;*Radiosurgery",
38710602,Trans-radial cerebral angiography for stereotactic radiosurgery treatment of arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVES: The popularity of trans-radial access (TRA) for cerebral angiography is growing. Potential benefits of TRA over traditional trans-femoral access (TFA) are multitude. This study aimed to evaluate discharge outcomes and patient opinion of TRA compared to TFA in patients undergoing cerebral angiography prior to stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) treatment for cerebral arteriovenous malformations. METHODS: Consecutive patients treated at the National Centre for Stereotactic Radiosurgery (Sheffield, United Kingdom) over a 22-month period were included. All patients underwent cerebral angiography with either TRA or TFA as part of treatment planning prior to SRS. TRA patients who had previously undergone TFA in other centres were surveyed for their experience of cerebral angiography using a questionnaire. SRS staff at our centre was approached for their opinion. RESULTS: 492 patients were included (median age = 43 years, 57.5% male, median lesions treated = 1). More patients underwent angiography with TFA (75.2%) than TRA (24.8%). No difference was found in accumulated dose for angiography between the groups (p>0.05). There was 17.6% reduction in overnight stay between TRA and TRF, the proportion of patients requiring overnight admission was higher for the TFA (35.2%) than TRA (17.6%, p<0.05). 101 patients were surveyed, with a response rate of 47%. Most respondents (79%) indicated preference for TRA over TFA. CONCLUSIONS: Use of TRA in pre-SRS cerebral angiography is feasible and improves both patient and staff experience. The adoption of TRA could have important implications for department resources and costs by reducing the proportion of overnight admissions.",2024 Jul,2024,Clinical radiology,79,7,e941-e948,eng,False,S0009-9260(24)00196-X;10.1016/j.crad.2024.04.005;S0009-9260(24)00196-X;10.1016/j.crad.2024.04.005,Journal Article,Humans;*Radiosurgery/methods;Male;Female;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/surgery;Adult;*Cerebral Angiography/methods;Radial Artery/diagnostic imaging;Middle Aged;Treatment Outcome;Surveys and Questionnaires;Aged;Adolescent;Femoral Artery/diagnostic imaging;Retrospective Studies,
36245099,Clinical Characteristics and Multimodality Therapy Outcomes in 304 Pediatric Patients with Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformations.,"BACKGROUND: Clinical follow-up data of pediatric patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are limited. This study investigated the characteristics of AVMs in children and analyzed the clinical outcomes of multimodality therapy in pediatric patients with AVMs at a single center. METHODS: This retrospective study included consecutive patients diagnosed with AVMs at our institution between August 2008 and June 2018. Data on demographic characteristics, AVM features, and clinical outcomes were collected. Patients aged <18 years at admission were defined as children. RESULTS: Overall, 1009 patients with AVMs were included, with 304 (30.1%) patients aged <18 years. AVMs in pediatric patients were more likely to present with intracranial hemorrhage, mostly located in deep areas of the brain. A small nidus, exclusively deep drainage, and deep AVM location were associated with hemorrhage in children; Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients with ruptured AVMs had a higher risk of developing a follow-up hemorrhage than those with unruptured AVMs. Among 290 children who were followed up, the multivariate regression analysis showed that a higher pretreatment modified Rankin Scale score, deep AVM location, and conservative treatment were significantly associated with unfavorable outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric patients, AVMs were more likely to present with intracranial hemorrhage than that in adults. Hemorrhagic presentation in children was associated with a small nidus, exclusively deep drainage, and deep AVM location. Pediatric patients with ruptured AVMs had significantly higher risks of follow-up hemorrhage than those with unruptured AVMs. Our clinical results suggest that nonconservative treatment is better for pediatric patients with AVMs.",2022 Dec,2022,World neurosurgery,168,,e150-e161,eng,False,S1878-8750(22)01341-9;10.1016/j.wneu.2022.09.064;S1878-8750(22)01341-9;10.1016/j.wneu.2022.09.064,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Adult;Child;Humans;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/therapy;Intracranial Hemorrhages/epidemiology/etiology/therapy;Kaplan-Meier Estimate;*Radiosurgery/methods,Cerebral arteriovenous malformations;Clinical outcome;Intracranial hemorrhage;Multimodality therapy;Pediatrics
25640553,Combined treatment of brain AVMs by Onyx embolization and gamma knife radiosurgery decreased hemorrhage risk despite low obliteration rate.,"AIM: The effectiveness and risk of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) treatment with Onyx embolization combined with Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) were rarely reported. In the present study, we analyzed the radiographic and clinical outcomes of combined Onyx embolization and GKS for cerebral AVMs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 86 patients' clinical outcomes were fully collected. Modalities and complications of the procedure were analyzed as well as the clinical and anatomic outcomes. Risk factors associated with hemorrhage were determined by multivariate analysis. RESULTS: The mean duration of radiological and clinical follow-up was 42 months (12.3-82.5 months) and 57.6 months (12.3-108.9 months), respectively. The total annual hemorrhage rate was 1.66% with 2.26% for ruptured AVMs and 1.08% for unruptured AVMs. The annual mortality rate was 0.4%. The total obliteration rate was 28.2% at follow-up. Clinical deterioration occurred in 4 patients (4.7%). Volume larger than 22 ml, diameter prior GKS larger than 3.5 cm and margin dose less than 16 Gy significantly increased the hemorrhage risk. CONCLUSION: The post-treatment hemorrhage could be predictable based on AVM's characteristics and treatment approaches. The annual hemorrhage rate was low for both ruptured and unruptured AVMs after combined treatment; however, the total obliteration rate was low. Long-term follow-up and larger population are needed for evaluating the clinical effect for this combined treatment.",2015,2015,Turkish neurosurgery,25,1,100-10,eng,True,10.5137/1019-5149.JTN.10708-14.1;10.5137/1019-5149.JTN.10708-14.1,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Cerebral Angiography;Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology;Child;Combined Modality Therapy;Embolization, Therapeutic/*methods;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/*therapy;Male;Middle Aged;Postoperative Complications/etiology;Radiosurgery/*methods;Risk Factors;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",
11013090,Endovascular treatment of aneurysms associated with cerebral arteriovenous malformations: experiences after the introduction of Guglielmi detachable coils.,"The authors have treated 172 patients with arteriovenous malformation (AVM) since 1993. Among them, 25 patients had aneurysms with a total number of 43. The aneurysms were divided into four groups; proper feeder aneurysm (4), flow-related distal aneurysm (beyond the circle of Willis or M1, 7), flow-related proximal aneurysm (26) and remote aneurysm (6). Guglielmi detachable coil (GDC) embolisation was performed in 12 patients with 15 aneurysms. Gamma knife radiosurgery for AVM was performed in 10 of those 12 patients. Two of the proper feeder aneurysms were embolised with liquid material, together with the corresponding part of the AVM. The other aneurysms were treated surgically (14) or observed (12). There was no bleeding from aneurysms after treatment. In conclusion, GDC embolisation is a useful treatment for aneurysms associated with AVM, especially if the AVM is treated by radiosurgery. Liquid embolisation of a proper feeder aneurysm is one of the treatment options.

We included both elective AVM and AVM that had bled acutely. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed data from patients with cerebral AVMs who underwent embolisation followed by microsurgical resection on the same day at a single neurosurgical centre. PRIMARY ENDPOINTS INCLUDED: Total procedure time (embolisation and microsurgical resection), procedure finish time, intra-operative blood loss, degree of nidus obliteration on postoperative angiography, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, total stay at the neurosurgical centre and modified Rankin Score (pre- and post-procedure). RESULTS: •Nineteen patients underwent same-day pre-operative embolisation and microsurgical resection over the 32-month period. The average patient age was 40 years (range 19-66 years). One patient had undergone a prior attempt at embolisation and one patient previously had sterotactic radiosurgery (STRS). •Thirteen of the AVM were in the dominant hemisphere and six in the non-dominant hemisphere. Sixteen AVM were located supratentorially and three were in the posterior fossa. Spetzler-Martin grades included 4 grade 1, 10 grade 2, 4 grade 3 and 1 grade 4. •The average blood loss intra-operatively was 289 mls. •The average list finish time was 19:56 (range 15:10-00:00). •Seventeen patients had 100% nidus obliteration on post-operative digital subtraction angiography, one patient had a small remnant and was referred to STRS and one patient died in the ICU post operatively. CONCLUSION: Overall, the authors believe same-day embolisation and microsurgical resection represents a safe treatment strategy.

11404697,[Advances in the contributions of imaging to stereotaxic localization of cerebral arteriovenous malformations for radiosurgery ].,"Historically, angiography was one of the first diagnostic methods to allow for visualization of neurovascular structures. It has been and still is very useful for precise evaluation of vascular pathology and is one of the main elements in treatment planning for radiosurgical targets. It is the only imaging method that gives insight into the angioarchitecture of a cerebral arteriovenous malformation, possibly reducing the target volume. Construction of frames (Leksell, Fisher) that are compatible with cross-sectional imaging methods, such as CT and MRI allowed there use for planning of stereotactical treatment for brain cerebral arteriovenous malformations. The advantages of these methods are given by the fact, that they are less invasive and that they allow visualization of neurovascular structures and surrounding cerebral structures. Further evolution of the cross-sectional imaging techniques allowed reconstruction of the image data in different planes and segmentation of structures such as vessels. Use of special algorithms allow visualization of the image data, i.e. surface rendering with 3D images of vascular structures. However, such images allow no detailed insight into the angioarchitecture of a cerebral arteriovenous malformation and give rather a view of the whole volume, i.e. a ""tumor"" aspect of the cerebral arteriovenous malformation. Similar images are currently also obtained with digital substraction angiography using rotational image acquisitions and image postprocessing allowing 3D reconstruction of angiographical image data. The different image evaluation methods are thus complementary all giving useful information for treatment planning. Therefore it would be useful to develop the possibility to integrate the information obtained by these modalities. Image fusion require identification of fiducial marks, what can be performed with application of external marks or by using internal anatomical marks. Recent developments allow now use of vascular structures as fidiucial marks to obtain image fusion. This paper reports on the evolution of stereotactical planning, performed on 541 patients over a period of eight years.",2001 May,2001,Neuro-Chirurgie,47,2-3 Pt 2,201-11,fre,False,75801,Evaluation Study;Journal Article;Review,"Angiography, Digital Subtraction/methods;Artifacts;Cerebral Angiography/methods;Contrast Media;Diagnostic Imaging/*trends;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/methods;Imaging, Three-Dimensional/methods;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/diagnostic;Magnetic Resonance Angiography/methods;Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods;Models, Anatomic;Phantoms, Imaging;Radiosurgery/*methods;Software;*Stereotaxic Techniques;Tomography, X-Ray Computed/methods",
37943292,Early experience of thalidomide therapy for high-grade peripheral and facial arteriovenous malformations.,"BACKGROUND: Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are developmental defects in the vascular system with abnormal connections between arteries and veins. A minority of AVMs are characterized by aggressive growth and continue to proliferate despite maximal surgical and interventional therapy. We report our outcomes with the use of thalidomide as the only UK specialist center adopting this novel approach for the management of AVMs refractory to conventional therapy. METHODS: This was a retrospective case series which included only complex and proliferative AVM lesions (Schobinger grade III and IV). All patients prescribed thalidomide on a compassionate basis between September 2006 and August 2022 after attempts at embolosclerotherapy without satisfactory response were reviewed. RESULTS: Eleven patients were included in our study. The median total duration of thalidomide use was 10 months. Two thirds of patients with pain (six of nine) reported an improvement, three quarters reported a reduction in swelling (six of eight) and all who presented with bleeding reported improvement in overall volume or frequency (four of four). Over the study period, 45% achieved a non-proliferative state with no further target vessel demonstrable on angiography. Mild, tolerable side effects such as fatigue were common (73%). There was only one major adverse reaction (neutropenia) necessitating cessation of therapy. CONCLUSIONS: We can conclude that thalidomide is able to reduce the symptom burden for patients with complex and proliferative AVMs that were refractory to established treatment modalities. Adverse effects are common, but the benefit achieved from taking thalidomide in otherwise treatment resistant cases outweighs the risks, most of which are manageable.",2023 Oct,2023,International angiology : a journal of the International Union of Angiology,42,5,448-456,eng,False,10.23736/S0392-9590.23.05111-8;S0392-9590.23.05111-8;10.23736/S0392-9590.23.05111-8,Journal Article,"Humans;Retrospective Studies;Thalidomide/adverse effects;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/etiology/surgery;Treatment Outcome;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects;*Embolization, Therapeutic/adverse effects",

METHODS: Fully automated segmentation via unsupervised classification with fuzzy c-means clustering was used to analyze the AVM nidus on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging studies. The proportions of vasculature, brain parenchyma, and cerebrospinal fluid were quantified. These were compared with the results from manual segmentation. The association between the brain parenchyma component and RIC development was assessed. RESULTS: The proposed algorithm was applied to 39 unruptured AVMs in 39 patients (17 female and 22 male patients), with a median age of 27 years. The median proportion of the constituents was as follows: vasculature, 31.3%; brain parenchyma, 48.4%; and cerebrospinal fluid, 16.8%. RICs were identified in 17 of the 39 patients (43.6%). Compared with manual segmentation, the automated algorithm was able to achieve a Dice similarity index of 79.5% (sensitivity, 73.5%; specificity, 85.5%). RICs were associated with a greater proportion of intervening nidal brain parenchyma (52.0% vs. 45.3%; P = 0.015). Obliteration was not associated with greater proportions of nidal vasculature (36.0% vs. 31.2%; P = 0.152).

Several factors are evoked and discussed mainly: inaccurate target, intentional partial irradiation, repermeabilization of a previously embolized cerebral arteriovenous malformation. The results suggest the necessity of a complete irradiation of the nidus. The strategy of partial volume irradiation should be avoided, even if it necessitates lowering of the doses in large cerebral arteriovenous malformations.

18503354,Calculation of isoeffective doses and the alpha/beta value by comparing results following radiosurgery and radiotherapy for arteriovenous malformations of the brain.,"OBJECT: The authors sought to assess the relationship between obliteration rate and different dose parameters following fractionated radiotherapy for arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). A comparison of the results of radiosurgery and radiotherapy for AVMs was made to calculate the best fit alpha/beta value, which would then be used as a model for predicting the treatment outcome, independent of the number of fractions applied. METHODS: Data from 1453 patients were analyzed: 1154 treated with radiosurgery and 300 with fractionated radiotherapy. The relationships between dose and obliteration rate after 3 years were calculated, and the best fit curve to the empirical results was defined. The higher the dose per fraction, biologically effective dose, and the lower the total dose, the higher the obliteration rate. The isoeffective doses when comparing radiotherapy and radiosurgery independent of the alpha/beta value could not be defined. The dose per fraction had the best predictive value, independent of the number of fractions. CONCLUSIONS: Dose per fraction seems to be the decisive parameter for the treatment response following both radiotherapy and radiosurgery. A larger number of fractions did not increase the obliteration rate. The data indicate that higher doses per fraction should be used when irradiating AVMs.",2006 Dec,2006,Journal of neurosurgery,105 Suppl,,183-9,eng,False,10.3171/sup.2006.105.7.183,Journal Article;Review,"*Dose Fractionation, Radiation;Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*radiotherapy/*surgery;*Radiosurgery;Radiotherapy Dosage;Therapeutic Equivalency;Treatment Outcome",
29248377,Management of a complex intracranial arteriovenous malformation with gamma knife radiosurgery: A case report with review of literature.,"The risks and benefits of arteriovenous malformation (AVM) treatment should be considered cautiously in each patient since management strategy of it depends on various factors including age of the patient, location and volume of AVM and presence of other vascular abnormalities. Current management options of AVM include observation, endovascular embolization, radiosurgery and microsurgical resection or in combination of any two of the above procedures. Here, we have discussed a case of intracranial AVM with radiation induced early cyst formation, and performed a literature review to determine the optimum treatment of complex intracranial AVM. Standard search strategies were performed in PubMed/Medline using appropriate terms such as ""intracranial arteriovenous malformation"" radiosurgery, embolization and microsurgical resection as well as medical subject headings. The particular case in this study was retrospectively reviewed. Literature review revealed that the mean marginal radiation dose used by the different authors was 19 Gy, cysts were developed in 3.6% patients, the average time to form cyst was 6.6 years, average volume of cyst was 6.7 ml and maximum cysts were removed by resection. In our case, the cyst was developed 2.5 years after radiosurgery. Radiation induced cyst formation is a delayed complication of AVM management. However, cyst formation in this case was comparatively earlier in our case. Therefore, continuous follow-up after radiosurgery is required for early detection of cyst formation. In addition, the review revealed that embolization before radiosurgery was a poor strategy.",2018 Mar,2018,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society,49,,26-31,eng,False,S0967-5868(17)31217-1;10.1016/j.jocn.2017.10.056;S0967-5868(17)31217-1;10.1016/j.jocn.2017.10.056,Case Reports;Journal Article;Review,Adult;Arteriovenous Fistula/*diagnostic imaging/*surgery;*Disease Management;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Male;Radiosurgery/*methods;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome,Gamma knife radiosurgery;Microsurgery;Outcomes and complications;Predictors
30904809,Dose Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiotherapy for Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations: A Case Series and Review of the Literature.,"BACKGROUND: Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are pathologic tangles of intracerebral vessels. The treatment of AVMs aims to reduce the risk of devastating intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT) can be used to treat large lesions and reduce the risk of radiation toxicity to the surrounding structures. We analyzed the data from our institutional experience of the past 15 years in treating large AVMs with both 5- and 6-fraction HSRT and evaluated the pretreatment characteristics that are most predictive of the radiographic response. METHODS: We included 37 patients and 42 treatments of intracranial AVMs measuring >3 cm in their largest dimension. Data were collected retrospectively by reviewing the electronic health records. The AVM volume was measured before HSRT and at the most recent follow-up appointment. Symptomatic outcomes, including treatment-related inflammation, were measured and defined categorically. RESULTS: Complete obliteration was achieved in 11.9% of the patients. The mean AVM volume had decreased significantly after HSRT (P = 8.7e-8). The percentage of volume reduction differed significantly between patients receiving 30-Gy fractions, (∂V = -48.7%) and those receiving 25-Gy fractions (∂V = -29.1%; P = 0.035). Patients with partial or complete obliteration were more likely to have received a total dose of 30 Gy rather than 25 Gy (P = 0.056) and showed a trend toward being treatment naive (P = 0.053). CONCLUSION: HSRT can be used as a method to manage large AVMs, with obliteration in some cases and sufficient volume reduction in most others for adjuvant treatment with other modalities. The 30-Gy total dose was generally superior to 25 Gy in achieving obliteration or volume reduction. Further studies focused on longer follow-up periods are warranted.",2019 Jun,2019,World neurosurgery,126,,e1456-e1467,eng,False,S1878-8750(19)30797-1;10.1016/j.wneu.2019.03.119;S1878-8750(19)30797-1;10.1016/j.wneu.2019.03.119,Journal Article,"Adult;Aged;Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Postoperative Complications/epidemiology;Predictive Value of Tests;Radiation Dosage;Radiation Dose Hypofractionation;Radiosurgery/*methods;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",Dose fractionation;Intracranial arteriovenous malformations;Radiosurgery;Radiotherapy dosage
29864564,Management of Residual Brain Arteriovenous Malformations After Stereotactic Radiosurgery.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess outcome of residual brain arteriovenous malformation (BAVM) after stereotactic radiosurgery. METHODS: Patients with residual BAVM 3 years after radiosurgery were retrospectively included. Demographics, angioarchitectural characteristics, complications, bleeding, and cure rates of patients with intervention or conservative management (i.e., observation) were compared. We analyzed characteristics of patients treated conservatively who achieved cure or still had persistent BAVMs during follow-up. RESULTS: The study included 87 patients including 5 patients with subtotal obliteration with a mean follow-up time of 33.7 ± 36.6 months. Of patients, 27 (31.0%) received subsequent treatment (radiosurgery, n = 23; microsurgery, n = 3; embolization, n = 1), and 60 (69%) were treated conservatively. After repeat SRS, 4 (14.8%) patients experienced symptomatic complications after the second treatment, and 7 (25.9%) experienced asymptomatic changes. Three (3.4%) patients, all of whom presented initially with a ruptured BAVM, experienced hemorrhage during follow-up. Subsequent treatment was effective with a complete cure of BAVM in 11 patients (40.7%). Complete resolution of the residual BAVM occurred in 15 (25%) patients treated conservatively. CONCLUSIONS: Complete obliteration of a significant number of residual BAVMs may occur 3-5 years after the first irradiation, whereas increased radiation dose associated with repeat SRS may lead to an increased risk of complications. The fact that the interval risk of bleeding decreased after SRS (especially for ruptured BAVM) lends further strength to the argument for a conservative management approach for residual BAVM 3-5 years after the first irradiation.",2018 Aug,2018,World neurosurgery,116,,e1105-e1113,eng,False,S1878-8750(18)31134-3;10.1016/j.wneu.2018.05.180;S1878-8750(18)31134-3;10.1016/j.wneu.2018.05.180,Journal Article,"Adult;Aged;Brain/*surgery;Cerebral Angiography/methods;Conservative Treatment;*Embolization, Therapeutic;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome",Brain arteriovenous malformations;Radiosurgery;Residual brain AVM
27154219,"Posterior fossa brain arteriovenous malformations : Clinical features and outcomes of endovascular embolization, adjuvant microsurgery and radiosurgery.","BACKGROUND: Posterior fossa brain arteriovenous malformations (PFbAVM) are relatively rare brain disorders but have a high risk of hemorrhage. Endovascular embolization to reduce the lesion size before treatment may improve the outcome of PFbAVM. The purposes of this study were to identify risk factors associated with hemorrhage in PFbAVM and to assess clinical outcomes in patients receiving initial endovascular embolization. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From 1999 to 2013 a total of 63 patients with PFbAVMs were treated (31 males and 32 females, 14.1 % of all AVM cases). A retrospective examination of patient demographics, clinical presentation, angiographic features, treatment modalities, complications and outcomes was carried out. The re-hemorrhage rate, obliteration rate and modified Rankin scale (MRS) were used as measures of outcome. RESULTS: Of the 63 PFbAVM patients 54 (85.7 %) exhibited hemorrhage and 15 had confirmed aneurysms. The cerebellar location (P = 0.007) and deep venous drainage (P = 0.012) were independent predictors of hemorrhage in multivariate analyses. The mean estimated devascularization was 46.9 % (range 10-100 %) in the 20 patients (31.7 %) treated by endovascular embolization. The 16 patients with residual niduses were further treated by radiosurgery, microsurgery or embolization. Complete obliteration was attained in 12 patients (67 %) while 2 (5.7 %) were left with persisting neurological deficits and 1 had a re-hemorrhage 3 years later (annual rate of 4.6 %). Favorable outcome (MRS ≤ 2) was obtained in the 20 patients receiving initial endovascular embolization (P = 0.039 versus preoperative MRS). CONCLUSION: Cerebellar location and deep venous drainage are predictors of hemorrhage in PFbAVM.

17659161,Intracranial arteriovenous malformations treated with LINAC-based conformal radiosurgery: validation of the radiosurgery-based arteriovenous malformation score as a predictor of outcome.,"OBJECTIVE: To validate the radiosurgery-based arteriovenous malformation score (RBAS) as a predictor of outcome in patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) treated with LINAC-based conformal radiosurgery. METHODS: We analysed 40 patients with a mean follow-up of 22 months. One patient (2.5%) pertained to Spetzler-Martin Grade I, 11 (27.5%) to Grade II, 19 (47.5%) to Grade III, eight (20%) to Grade IV and one (2.5%) to grade V. The mean RBAS was 2.0 (range: 0.76-5.56). The mean obliteration prediction index (OPI) and the Karlsson index (KI) were 0.74 (range: 0.2-2.86) and 109.48 (range: 3.0-350.7) respectively. Outcomes were analysed according to the OPI, KI and RBAS. RESULTS: We analysed different cutoff points in the RBAS and found a significant difference to predict the outcome in four scores: 1.2, 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8. In the group with RBAS < or = 1.8, 13 (68%) had an excellent outcome and six (33%) did not, while with RBAS>1.8, seven (32%) had an excellent outcome and 14 (67%) did not (p = 0.02). We did not find any correlation between Spetzler-Martin grading scale or OPI and outcome (p = 0.7 and p = 0.3 respectively). The KI predicted the excellent outcome in 8/9 patients (89%) with KI < or = 27 and in 12/31 patients (39%) with KI>27 (p = 0.08). CONCLUSION: The RBAS seems to be a good predictor of outcome in patients with AVMs treated with LINAC-based conformal radiosurgery as in patients treated with Gamma Knife.

37378842,Nidus Compacity Determined by Semi-Automated Segmentation is a Strong Quantitative Predictor of Brain Arterio-Venous Malformation Cure.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: A compact nidus is a well-known feature of good outcome after treatment in brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVM). This item, included in the ""Supplementary AVM grading system"" by Lawton, is subjectively evaluated on DSA. The present study aimed to assess whether quantitative nidus compacity along with other angio-architectural bAVM features were predictive of angiographic cure or the occurrence of procedure-related complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 83 patients prospectively collected data base between 2003 to 2018 having underwent digital subtraction 3D rotation angiography (3D-RA) for pre-therapeutic assessment of bAVM. Angio-architectural features were analyzed. Nidus compacity was measured with a dedicated segmentation tool. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to test the association between these factors and complete obliteration or complication. RESULTS: Compacity was the only significant factor associated with complete obliteration in our predictive model using logistic multivariate regression; the area under the curve for compacity predicting complete obliteration was excellent (0.82; 95% CI 0.71-0.90; p < 0.0001). The threshold value maximizing the Youden index was a compacity > 23% (sensitivity 97%; specificity 52%; 95% CI 85.1-99.9; p = 0.055). No angio-architectural factor was associated with the occurrence of a complication. CONCLUSION: Nidus high compacity quantitatively measured on 3D-RA, using a dedicated segmentation tool is predictive of bAVM cure.

36087321,Effect of embolization before stereotactic radiosurgery for brain arteriovenous malformations: a case-control study with propensity score matching.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether endovascular embolization prior to stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has a negative impact on nidus obliteration for patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). METHODS: A total of 704 eligible patients with AVM who did not undergo prior surgery or radiotherapy were evaluated. Of these patients, 593 were treated with SRS only, and 111 were treated with embolization followed by SRS (E+SRS). Most patients in the E+SRS group (88%) underwent embolization with n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate. In the comparison of radiosurgical outcomes between patients treated with SRS only and E+SRS, these groups were matched in a 1:1 ratio using propensity score matching to eliminate differences in basic characteristics. The primary outcome was to compare the nidus obliteration rates between the SRS-only and E+SRS groups. The secondary outcomes were the comparison of cumulative hemorrhage rates and the incidence of cyst formation or chronic encapsulated hematoma after SRS between these groups. RESULTS: In the unmatched cohorts, the actuarial 3-, 5-, and 8-year nidus obliteration rates after a single SRS session were 49.6%, 69.4%, and 74.1% in the SRS-only group, respectively, and 30.7%, 50.9%, and 68.6% in the E+SRS group, respectively (p = 0.001). In the matched cohort of 98 patients in each group, the rates were 47.1%, 62.0%, and 69.6% in the SRS-only group and 32.5%, 55.3%, and 75.0% in the E+SRS group, respectively (p = 0.24). There was no significant difference in either cumulative hemorrhage or the incidence of cyst formation or chronic encapsulated hematoma between the groups.

17121129,Radiosurgical treatment for rolandic arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECT: The authors reviewed the radiosurgical outcomes in patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) located in the rolandic area, including the primary motor and sensory gyri. METHODS: The study population consisted of 38 patients with rolandic-area AVMs who underwent linear accelerator radiosurgery at the University of Toronto between 1989 and 2000. Obliteration rate, risk of hemorrhage during the latency period, radiation-induced complications, seizure control, and functional status were evaluated. Patients were also divided into two subgroups according to AVM volume (< 3 cm3 and > or = 3 cm3). Patients were followed up for a median of 42.4 months (range 30-103 months), and the median age of the patients was 40 years (range 12-67 years). The median AVM volume was 8.1 cm3 (range 0.32-21, mean 8.32 cm3), and the median dose at the tumor margin was 15 Gy (range 15-22, mean 16.8 Gy). The risk of hemorrhage after radiosurgery was 5.3% for the 1st year, 2.6% for the 2nd, and 0% for the 3rd. Two patients (5.3%) sustained adverse effects related to radiation for more than 6 months. Complete nidus obliteration after a single radiosurgical treatment was achieved in 23 patients (60.5%). The obliteration rate for AVMs smaller than 3 cm3 was 83.3% (10 of 12) and that for AVMs larger than or equal to 3 cm3 was 50% (13 of 26). Among the patients who had seizures as the initial presentation, 51.8% were free of seizures after radiosurgery and the seizure pattern improved in 40.7% during the 3rd and last year of follow up. Overall, excellent results (obliteration and no new or worsening neurological deficit) can be achieved in approximately 60% of patients. This percentage varies according to the AVM size and can reach 83% in patients with AVMs smaller than 3 cm3. CONCLUSIONS: Radiosurgery is a safe and effective treatment for people with rolandic AVMs. The low rate of morbidity associated with radiosurgery, compared with other treatments, indicates that this method may be the first choice for patients with AVMs located in this area.",2006 Nov,2006,Journal of neurosurgery,105,5,689-97,eng,False,10.3171/jns.2006.105.5.689,Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Child;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/mortality/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;*Motor Cortex;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects;Recovery of Function;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome,
34982875,Effects of Preoperative Embolization on Spetzler-Martin Grade I and II Arteriovenous Malformations: A Propensity-Adjusted Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) with low Spetzler-Martin grades (I and II) are associated with good neurological outcomes after microsurgical resection; however, the use of preoperative embolization for these lesions is controversial. OBJECTIVE: To compare the neurological outcomes of preoperative embolization with no embolization in patients with low-grade AVMs. METHODS: Patients with a Spetzler-Martin grade I or II AVM who underwent microsurgical resection during January 1, 1997, through December 31, 2019, were analyzed. Patients undergoing preoperative embolization were compared with patients not undergoing embolization. A propensity score was constructed from baseline characteristics and used to match intervention (embolization) and control (nonembolization) groups in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome was poor neurological status on last follow-up examination, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score >2 and a modified Rankin Scale score worse at follow-up than at the preoperative examination. RESULTS: Of the 603 patients analyzed, 310 (51.4%) underwent preoperative embolization and 293 (48.6%) did not. Patients in the embolization cohort compared with those in the nonembolization cohort had a higher percentage of Spetzler-Martin grade II AVMs (71.6% vs 52.6%, P < .001) and a lower percentage of hemorrhage (41% vs 55%, P = .001). After propensity score matching, no differences were found between paired cohorts (each N = 203) for baseline characteristics with a significant reduction in absolute standardized mean differences. No significant differences were found in primary outcomes between treatment groups in the matched or unmatched cohorts.

21495824,Effect of liquid embolic agents on Gamma Knife surgery dosimetry for arteriovenous malformations. Clinical article.,"OBJECT: The effectiveness of Gamma Knife stereotactic surgery to obliterate brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) may be diminished by the preoperative adjunctive use of endovascular liquid embolic agents. The purpose of the present investigation was to determine if commercially available liquid embolic agents reduce the radiation dose to the target because of attenuation of the (60)Co beam. METHODS: The apparent linear attenuation coefficients for 120- to 140-keV radiographs in embolized regions were retrieved from CT scans for several patients with AVMs who had undergone embolization procedures with liquid embolic agents to reduce nidal volumes. Based on these coefficients and a virtual model of Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) with basic ray tracing, the authors obtained the path lengths and densities of the embolized regions. The attenuation of (60)Co beams was then calculated for various sizes and positions of embolized AVM regions and for the number of beams used for treatment. Published experiments for several high-atomic-number materials were used to estimate the effective (60)Co beam attenuation coefficients for the N-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA, suspended in ethiodized oil) and ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVOH, with suspended micronized tantalum powder, Onyx) used in the AVM embolizations. Dose reductions during GKS were calculated for a theoretical model based on the CT-documented apparent linear attenuation coefficients and for the (60)Co energy attenuation coefficient. Dose measurements were obtained in a phantom study with EVOH for comparison with the estimates generated from the two attenuation coefficients. RESULTS: Based on CT (keV) apparent attenuation coefficients, the authors' theoretical model predicted that the cumulative effect of either of the embolic agents decreased the number of kilovoltage photons in an embolized nidus by -8% to -15% because of the increased atomic number and density of NBCA and Onyx. However, in using the effective attenuation coefficient for the (60)Co energies as is used in GKS, the authors' theoretical model yielded only a 0.2% dose reduction per beam and a < 0.01%-0.2% dose reduction in total. These theoretical results were validated by measurements in a head phantom containing Onyx. CONCLUSIONS: Dose reduction due to attenuation of the (60)Co beam by the AVM embolization material was negligible for both NBCA and EVOH because of the high-energy (60)Co beam.",2011 Aug,2011,Journal of neurosurgery,115,2,364-70,eng,False,10.3171/2011.3.JNS10717;10.3171/2011.3.JNS10717,Journal Article,"Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*therapeutic use;Embolization, Therapeutic/methods;Enbucrilate/*therapeutic use;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/drug therapy/*surgery;Polyvinyls/*therapeutic use;Radiography;Radiosurgery/*instrumentation;Radiotherapy Dosage",
17398029,Risk of hemorrhage and obliteration rates of LINAC-based radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations treated after prior partial embolization.,"PURPOSE: We investigate patient outcome, risk of hemorrhage, and factors affecting obliteration after LINAC-based radiosurgery (RS) for cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM) treated after partial embolization. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This analysis is based on 50 patients treated after prior embolization. According to the Spetzler-Martin criteria the AVM classification was as follows: 9 patients, Grade I (18%); 19, Grade II (38%); 18, Grade III (36%); and 4, Grade IV (8%). Median RS-based AVM score was 1.41. Median single dose was 18 Gy/ 80% isodose (range, 15-22 Gy) and median AVM volume was 4.0 cc (range, 0.2-22.6 cc). In all, 34 patients (68%) experienced hemorrhage before RS. Median follow-up was 3.1 year (range, 8.5 months to 15 years). RESULTS: Actuarial complete obliteration rate was 67% after 3 years and 78% after 4 years. The complete obliteration rate was significantly higher in AVM <3 cm (92% vs. 60%, p < 0.01) and in AVM Spetzler-Martin Grade I/II (90% vs. 59%, p < 0,01). Intracranial hemorrhage after RS was seen in 6 patients (12%) after 8.5 months median. Annual bleeding risk was 7.9% after 1 year and 2.2% after 2 years. It was found that AVM diameter > or =3 cm (p < 0.006), AVM volume > or =4 cc (p < 0.01), AVM score > or =1.5 (p < 0.03), and single dose <18 Gy (p < 0.03) were associated with a significant higher bleeding risk. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of obliteration after RS in AVM treated after prior partial embolization depends on size as well as Spetzler-Martin grade.

37586818,Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on treatment and outcomes of cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"BACKGROUND: There has been a recent decrease in interventional management of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). The objective of our study was to evaluate the changing patterns in management of AVMs in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database was used. From 2016 to 2020, patients with an International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) diagnosis code for a cerebral AVM were included. An intervention was defined as ICD-10 code for surgical, endovascular, or stereotactic radiosurgery treatment. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using a logistic regression model with covariates deemed to be clinically relevant. RESULTS: 63 610 patients with AVMs were identified between 2016 and 2020, 14 340 of which were ruptured. In 2020, patients had an OR of 0.69 for intervention of an unruptured AVM (P<0.0001) compared with 2016-19. The rate of intervention for unruptured AVMs decreased to 13.5% in 2020 from 17.6% in 2016-19 (P<0.0001). The rate of AVM rupture in 2020 increased to 23.9% from 22.2% in 2016-19 (P<0.0001). In 2020, patients with ruptured AVMs had an OR for inpatient mortality of 1.72 compared with 2016-19. Linear regression analysis from 2016 to 2020 showed an inverse relationship between intervention rate and rupture rate (slope -0.499, R(2)=0.88, P=0.019). CONCLUSION: In 2020, the rate of intervention for unruptured cerebral AVMs decreased compared with past years, with an associated increase in the rate of rupture.

35249097,Children with Arteriovenous Malformations of the Central Nervous System: A Retrospective Study of 12 Pediatric Cases from a Single Tertiary Center in Slovenia.,"BACKGROUND Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) of the central nervous system (CNS) is a developmental condition that consists of a focal mass of interconnected veins and arteries. This retrospective study was conducted at the only tertiary center in Slovenia and included 12 pediatric cases of AVM of the CNS, diagnosed between 2000 and 2020. MATERIAL AND METHODS The patients were collected based on the ICD coding system. All available medical documentation was reviewed. RESULTS Our cohort included 6 boys and 6 girls. The mean age of patients was 9.1 years, range 1 month to 16.3 years. The estimated incidence of pediatric AVM of the CNS in Slovenia is 0.22/100 000 children per year. Ten patients had brain AVM and 2 patients had spinal AVM. At first presentation, 7 patients presented with intracerebral hemorrhage, 2 with focal neurological deficits, 1 with epilepsy, 1 with chronic headache, and 1 patient was asymptomatic. Two patients had their first hemorrhage after an already-established diagnosis of AVM. Endovascular embolization was performed in 50%, surgical resection in 33%, and conservative treatment in 17% of patients. Five patients had no residual neurological sequelae, 6 had some neurological deficits, and 1 patient died. Complete obliteration of AVM was achieved in 3 patients treated with surgery. They all had a favorable outcome, with no or mild deficit. CONCLUSIONS The study findings support that early diagnosis and management are required to prevent neurological deterioration and vessel rupture from AVM. Endovascular embolization was the most commonly used procedure. Complete obliteration was associated with good neurological outcome.",2022 Mar 6,2022,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and,28,,e936240,eng,False,10.12659/MSM.936240;936240;10.12659/MSM.936240,Journal Article;Observational Study,"Adolescent;Child;Child, Preschool;Embolization, Therapeutic/*methods;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Incidence;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/epidemiology/*therapy;Male;Radiosurgery/*methods;Retrospective Studies;Slovenia/epidemiology;*Tertiary Care Centers;Treatment Outcome",
27766428,Multiple cerebral arterio-venous malformations: impact of multiplicity and hemodynamics on treatment strategies.,"BACKGROUND: Multiple AVMs are exceptionally rare lesions and only a few larger series have been published, including other vascular pathologies, such as arterio-venous fistulae (AVF) or patients with hereditary syndromes. Our study presents clinical, angiographic, and therapeutic characteristics of patients harboring sporadic multiple AVMs. METHODS: Basic demographic data, vascular architecture, clinical presentation, treatment strategies, and treatment outcome were analyzed retrospectively from patients with cerebral AVMs treated in our department between 1990 and 2015. RESULTS: Six out of 539 patients (1.1 %) harbored 15 multiple and distinct cerebral lesions. Nidus size was predominantly small, consequently determining a Spetzler-Martin grade °I-°II (three-tier grading system). In three patients, AVMs shared a proximal feeding artery supply, whereas each AVM displayed its own venous drainage. Five of six patients (83 %) presented with hemorrhage. Four patients received therapy of the AVMs with complete elimination in 3/4 patients (75 %) and 8/9 treated AVMs (89 %). All patients with treatment of the AVM showed good-to-excellent recovery (n = 4, mRS ≤ 2). CONCLUSIONS: Multiple cerebral AVMs are complex vascular lesions. The multiplicity of hemodynamic and malformation-related variables influence treatment strategy and sequence. Thus, awareness of these parameters (of various malformations before and during treatment) is important. The high number of hemorrhagic events in the present series might justify a more aggressive treatment of multiple AVMs than previously thought.",2016 Dec,2016,Acta neurochirurgica,158,12,2399-2407,eng,False,10.1007/s00701-016-2989-8;10.1007/s00701-016-2989-8,Journal Article,"Adult;Aged;Cerebral Angiography;Child;Embolization, Therapeutic/*adverse effects;Female;Hemodynamics;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnostic imaging/surgery;Male;Middle Aged;*Postoperative Complications;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects;Retrospective Studies",AVM hemodynamics;AVM multiplicity;Cerebral arterio-venous malformation;Intracranial hemorrhage
17053597,Therapy of brain arteriovenous malformations: multimodality treatment from a balanced standpoint.,"The three therapeutic modalities for arteriovenous malformation (AVM) treatment (surgery, embolization, and radiotherapy) developed in the past years with specific tools, each tool with its own qualities. Soon after the implementation of embolization for treatment of AVMs, this technique was used in combination with microsurgery; since the development of radiosurgery, treatment algorithms combining embolization with surgery and eventual subsequent radiosurgery, embolization with radiosurgery, or surgery with subsequent radiosurgery have been reported. These different combinations have been in use under the term multimodality treatment for many years, but the algorithms regarding the combination of tools, which tool has priority, and how the risk levels of each tool are assessed shows great variability among institutions. Centers with a surgical background see embolization as a technique to increase surgical feasibility and radiosurgery as a tool to complete subtotal AVM excision.

23258510,Radiosurgery for brainstem arteriovenous malformation.,"The authors outlined the treatment result of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) inside the brainstem by reviewing the 4 existing studies in detail. The majority of patients with brainstem AVMs had a history of hemorrhage, leading to neurological deficits at the time of treatment in 72-73% of patients. The most frequent location was the midbrain or the pons depending on studies, while the medulla oblongata was the least common location throughout the series. The obliteration rate after radiosurgery was 44-73%, which was generally lower than in other locations, while the complication rate was 5-14%, which was expectedly higher than in other locations. No objective evidence for size is known, and therefore, patient selection and treatment planning should be carefully performed after judicious assessment of treatment risks and benefits among limited treatment options.",2013,2013,Progress in neurological surgery,27,,67-72,eng,False,10.1159/000341639;000341639;10.1159/000341639,Journal Article;Review,Arteriovenous Fistula/diagnosis/*surgery;Brain Stem/*abnormalities/*surgery;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/*surgery;Radiosurgery/*methods;Treatment Outcome,
34339893,Current Concepts and Perspectives on Brain Arteriovenous Malformations: A Review of Pathogenesis and Multidisciplinary Treatment.,"Brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) are unusual vascular pathologies characterized by the abnormal aggregation of dilated arteries and veins in the brain parenchyma and for which the absence of a normal vascular structure and capillary bed leads to direct connections between the arteries and veins. Although bAVMs have long been believed to be congenital anomalies that develop during the prenatal period, more recent studies have shown that inflammation is associated with AVM genesis, growth, and rupture. The interventional treatment options include microsurgery, stereotactic radiosurgery, and endovascular embolization, and management often comprises a multidisciplinary combination of these modalities. The appropriate selection of patients with bAVMs for interventional treatment requires balancing the risk of treatment complications against the risk of hemorrhage during the natural course of the pathology. However, no definitive guidelines have been established for the management of bAVMs. We have comprehensively reviewed the current basic and clinical studies of bAVMs and discussed the contemporary status of multidisciplinary management of bAVMs.",2022 Mar,2022,World neurosurgery,159,,314-326,eng,False,S1878-8750(21)01115-3;10.1016/j.wneu.2021.07.106;S1878-8750(21)01115-3;10.1016/j.wneu.2021.07.106,Journal Article;Review,"Brain/surgery;*Embolization, Therapeutic;Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery;Microsurgery;*Nervous System Malformations/surgery;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome",AVM;Arteriovenous malformation;Arteriovenous shunt;Multimodal;Neurosurgery;Pathobiology
25955806,The long-term outcomes of radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations in pediatric and adolescent populations.,"OBJECT Although stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has been accepted as a therapeutic option for arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in children and adolescents, substantial data are still lacking regarding the outcomes of SRS for AVMs in this age group, especially long-term complications. This study aimed to clarify the long-term outcomes of SRS for the treatment of AVM in pediatric patients aged ≤ 18 years. METHODS Outcomes of 116 patients who were aged 4-18 years when they underwent SRS between 1990 and 2009 at the study institute were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS The median follow-up period after SRS was 100 months, with 6 patients followed up for more than 20 years. Actuarial obliteration rates at 3 and 5 years after SRS were 68% and 88%, respectively. Five hemorrhages occurred in 851 patient-years of follow-up. The annual bleeding rate after SRS before obliteration was calculated as 1.3%, which decreased to 0.2% after obliteration. Shorter maximum nidus diameter (p = 0.02) and higher margin dose (p = 0.03) were associated with a higher obliteration rate. Ten patients experienced adverse events after SRS. Of them, 4 patients presented with delayed complications years after SRS (range 9-20 years after SRS). CONCLUSIONS SRS can reduce the risk of hemorrhage in pediatric and adolescent AVMs, with an acceptable risk of complications in the long term. However, adverse events such as expanding hematoma and radiation necrosis that can occur after substantial follow-up should be taken into account at the time that treatment decisions are made and informed consent is obtained.",2015 Aug,2015,Journal of neurosurgery.

34807285,Benefits from Exclusion Treatment of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformations on Epilepsy in Adults.,"PURPOSE: In approximately 30% of the patients, brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) are revealed by seizures, which may alter the patients' quality of life. Our objective was to evaluate the benefits of exclusion treatment (radiosurgery, embolization and/or surgery) on posttherapeutic epilepsy in bAVM patients without intracranial hemorrhage prior to treatment. METHODS: Our retrospective observational single-center study included all consecutive adult patients with an unruptured bAVM and epilepsy, treated at our institution from 1995 to 2019 and who were followed for at least 1 year. Data on angioarchitectural characteristics of bAVMs, on epilepsy and posttreatment modified Rankin Scale (mRS) were collected. The primary endpoint was a seizure-free status (defined as Engel class IA) after exclusion treatment versus conservative management. RESULTS: In this study one hundred and one consecutive adult patients with bAVMs, epilepsy and without bAVM rupture before any treatment were included; 21 (21%) in the conservative management group vs. 80 (79%) in the exclusion treatment group. After exclusion treatment, 55% of the patients from the group were Engel IA after treatment vs. 10% of the conservative management group (odds ratio [OR] 11.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.48-107.24, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that exclusion treatment in unruptured bAVMs with epilepsy is associated with a higher seizure-free rate in comparison with conservative management. Data from randomized controlled studies are necessary to confirm these findings.",2022 Sep,2022,Clinical neuroradiology,32,3,749-760,eng,False,10.1007/s00062-021-01119-w;10.1007/s00062-021-01119-w;10.1007/s00062-021-01119-w,Journal Article;Observational Study,"Adult;Brain;*Embolization, Therapeutic;*Epilepsy;Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations;Quality of Life;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome",Brain arteriovenous malformation;Endovascular embolization;Microsurgery;Seizure;Stereotaxic radiosurgery
17189079,Delineation of brain AVMs on MR-Angiography for the purpose of stereotactic radiosurgery.,"PURPOSE: To assess the dosimetric consequences of brain arteriovenous malformation (bAVM) delineation on magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) for the purpose of stereotactic radiosurgery. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Three observers contoured a bAVM in 20 patients, using digital subtraction angiography (V(DSA)) and three-dimensional time-of-flight MRA (V(MRA)). Displacement between contours was calculated. Agreement and differences between observers and imaging modalities were assessed. A standardized treatment plan with dynamic conformal arcs was generated and dosimetric coverage of all contours and the volume of normal brain tissue within the high dose region was determined. RESULTS: The generalized reliability coefficient was ""fair"" for target volume (0.79), but ""poor"" for displacement (0.35). V(MRA) was larger than V(DSA) (5.0 vs. 4.0 mL, p = 0.001). No difference in displacement was found (2.8 vs. 2.5 mm, p = 0.156). Dosimetric coverage of V(MRA) was 62.9% (95% CI, 56.9-68.8) when V(DSA) was used as planning target volume, and coverage of V(DSA) was 83.5% (95% CI, 78.1-88.8) when V(MRA) was used for planning (p < 0.001). The mean volume of normal brain within the 80% isodose was larger when the bAVM was delineated on MRA (0.7 vs. 1.0 mL (p = 0.02) for targets < or =3 mL and 3.7 vs. 7.0 mL (p = 0.01) for targets >3 mL). CONCLUSIONS: Brain arteriovenous malformations delineated on MRA are larger and more randomly displaced. However, for bAVMs < or =3 mL, the difference in volume of normal brain tissue within the high-dose region does not seem to be clinically relevant. Therefore, MRA-images might be used as the sole imaging modality for the radiosurgical treatment of bAVMs < or =3 mL when the bAVM is located in a noneloquent position.",2007 Jan 1,2007,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",67,1,308-16,eng,False,S0360-3016(06)02836-7;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2006.08.075,Journal Article,Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*pathology/radiotherapy/surgery;Magnetic Resonance Angiography/*methods;Observer Variation;Radiosurgery;Subtraction Technique,
15662828,Ultrastructural changes in arteriovenous malformations after gamma knife surgery: an electron microscopic study.,"OBJECT: The authors analyzed morphological alterations at the subcellular level by undertaking transmission electron microscopy in arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) after gamma knife surgery (GKS). METHODS: Histological, immunohistochemical, and electron microscopic investigations were performed in a series of pathological specimens obtained in seven patients. The patients harbored cerebral AVMs that had been previously treated with GKS and had suffered subsequent bleeding 10 to 52 months after treatment. Histological studies revealed spindle cell proliferation in the connective tissue stroma and in the subendothelial region of the irradiated AVM vessels. Electron microscopy demonstrated different ultrastructural characteristics of this spindle cell population. There were cells with a smooth-edged oval nuclei surrounded by massive bundles of collagen fibers in the extracellular matrix. Other cells with the same nuclear morphology contained abundant intracytoplasmic filaments. Nuclear deformation was connected to a fibrillary system developed within the cytoplasm, and peripheral attachment sites were related to an extracellular layer of basement membrane-like material arranged parallel to the cell border. Also present were cells containing well-developed cisterns of rough endoplasmic reticulum and dense bodies at the periphery of the cytoplasm with folded, irregular nuclei. CONCLUSIONS: The ultrastructural and histological characteristics of the spindle cell population in the GKS-treated AVMs are similar to those designated as myofibroblasts in wound healing processes and pathological fibromatoses. Because similar cell modifications have not been demonstrated in control nonirradiated AVM specimens, these myofibroblasts may contribute to the shrinking process and final occlusion of AVMs after radiosurgery.",2005 Jan,2005,Journal of neurosurgery,102 Suppl,,289-92,eng,False,10.3171/jns.2005.102.s_supplement.0289,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Cell Movement/physiology;Cytoskeleton/immunology/ultrastructure;Fibroblasts/immunology/ultrastructure;Humans;Hyalin/immunology/ultrastructure;Immunohistochemistry;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/immunology/surgery/ultrastructure;Microscopy, Electron, Transmission/methods;Radiosurgery/instrumentation/*methods;Stromal Cells/immunology/ultrastructure;von Willebrand Factor/immunology",
23391837,Combined treatment of brain AVMs with use of Onyx embolization followed by radiosurgery.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The treatment of cerebral AVMs is complex, reliant on interventions such as embolization, surgery, and radiosurgery, or a combination of these modalities. To date, treatment with the embolic agent Onyx, followed by radiosurgery, has not been evaluated. The goal of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this combination in a homogeneous, monocentric series. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From April 2003 to June 2008, a total of 20 patients (11 women and 9 men; age range, 10-55 years) were treated for AVMs with Onyx embolization followed by radiosurgery. AVM sizes were <3 cm in 7 patients and ≥3 cm in 13 patients. Modalities and complications of the procedure were analyzed as well as the long-term clinical and anatomic outcomes (2-5 years after treatment). RESULTS: Of 17 patients evaluated by DSA after radiosurgery, 10 (58.8%) were observed to have complete occlusion of the AVM nidus. Complete occlusion was observed in 5 (71.4%) of 7 Spetzler-Martin grade I-II AVMs and in 5 (50.0%) of 10 Spetzler-Martin grade III-IV AVMs. Complete occlusion was observed in 4 (80.0%) of 5 AVMs of <3 cm and 6 (50.0%) of 12 AVMs of >3 cm. One of 20 patients had significant worsening of clinical status (mRS ≥2) at long-term follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary series, the safety and efficacy of combined treatment by Onyx embolization followed by radiosurgery are quite satisfactory, with a low rate of clinical complications (5.0%) and a 58.8% rate of complete obliteration of the AVM.",2013 Jul,2013,AJNR.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We have treated 110 patients with cerebral AVM with linac-based radiosurgery (RS). AVM classification according Spetzler-Martin was 17 patients grade I (15%), 39 grade II (36%), 41 grade III (37%), 12 grade IV (11%) and 1 grade V (1%). Median single dose was 18 Gy. Mean treatment volume was 4.7 cc (range, 0.1-24.0 cc). Fifty-two patients experienced hemorrhage prior to RS. Median follow-up was 2.5 years. RESULTS: Actuarial complete obliteration rate (CO) was 51% after 3 years and 67% after 4 years. CO rate was significantly higher in AVM <3 cm (64% vs. 43%, P<0.04) and in patients with grade I/II vs. III-V (71% vs. 33%, P<0.001). CO was significantly improved after doses >18 Gy (P<0.02) and in male gender (P<0.04). In multivariate analysis Spetzler-Martin grade remained significant. Intracranial hemorrhage after RS occurred in 9 patients 13.9 months median after RS. Neurological dysfunction improved/completely dissolved or remained stable in 95% of patients. No new onset of neurological dysfunction was seen. No significant adverse effects after RS were seen. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of obliteration after RS in AVM depends on applied single dose as well as size and Spetzler-Martin grade.

25860430,Surgery for Unruptured Spetzler-Martin Grade 3 Brain Arteriovenous Malformations: A Prospective Surgical Cohort.,"BACKGROUND: There is uncertainty regarding the management of unruptured Spetzler-Martin grade 3 brain arteriovenous malformations (SMG3 ubAVM). OBJECTIVE: To analyze our series of patients treated by surgery. METHODS: A single-surgeon database of consecutively enrolled bAVMs (between 1989 and 2014) was analyzed. Adverse outcomes due to surgery were assigned within the first 6 weeks following surgery and outcome was prospectively recorded and assigned at the last follow-up visit by using modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. RESULTS: Of the 137 reviewed patients, 112 (82%) were treated by surgery, 15 (11%) were treated elsewhere or by radiosurgery, and 10 (7%) were recommended for conservative management. Surgery for SMG3 ubAVM was associated with adverse outcomes with a new permanent neurological deficit of mRS >1 in 23 of 112 (21%) patients. Permanent neurological deficit leading to a mRS >2 from surgery was 3.6% (95% confidence interval, 1.1%-9.1%). Late recurrence of a bAVM occurred in 3 of 103 (2.9%) patients who had complete obliteration of bAVM confirmed immediately after surgery and who were subsequently later followed with radiological studies during the mean follow-up period of 3.0 years (range, 6 days to 18.8 years). CONCLUSION: When discussing surgical options for SMG3 ubAVM, a thorough understanding of the significance and incidence of adverse events and outcomes is required to fully inform patients.

23419565,Long-term results of radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is known to safely result in a high obliteration rate for small and medium sized arteriovenous malformations (AVM). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term outcome of patients treated with SRS, with special emphasis given to obliteration and toxicity rates. METHODS: We performed a review of 43 cerebral AVM patients, treated from 1998 to 2008 with a single SRS dose ranging from 21-25 Gy. Of these, 37 had a minimal follow-up of one year. Medical files were reviewed to assess patient and AVM characteristics, the SRS treatment, therapy prior to SRS, the obliteration rate and toxicities. Whenever necessary, outcome data was supplemented by telephone interviews with the patient or treating physician. RESULTS: AVM size was ≥3cm in diameter in 21% of patients. Five patients (11.6%) underwent surgery prior to SRS and 31 patients (72.1%) received one or more embolizations prior to SRS. Of the patients followed with angiography ≥1 year post-SRS, 89% (33/37) had a complete obliteration of the nidus, after a median time of 24.7 months post-treatment. Embolization prior to SRS was not predictive of outcome. One patient suffered a non-fatal haemorrhage between treatment and obliteration. The rate of symptomatic radiation-induced radiological changes was 8.1%. CONCLUSION: Our study shows both obliteration and complication rates in the upper limit of those reported in the literature. SRS seems an attractive treatment option for small AVMs. Unlike other reports, the prior use of embolization did not impact negatively on obliteration rates.",2013 Mar,2013,The Canadian journal of neurological sciences.

19138850,Transcranial Doppler study of cerebral arteriovenous malformations after gamma knife radiosurgery.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical value of the Transcranial Doppler (TCD) in follow-up examinations after gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS) for arteriovenous malformations (AVM). We performed TCD after GKS in 18 patients who had cerebral AVMs to evaluate the hemodynamic effects of the procedure. Ten patients underwent TCD within 12 months after GKS, and eight between 12 and 24 months. The mean blood velocity (Vm) and pulsatility index (PI) were primarily analyzed in the feeding arteries (FAs) and non-FAs. Fifteen healthy volunteers served as control patients. The Vm values in the FAs after GKS ranged from 31 cm/s to 90 cm/s, with PI values ranging from 0.48 to 1.03. The Vm values in the comparable normal arteries ranged from 28 cm/s to 87 cm/s, and the PI values in these arteries ranged from 0.62 to 1.02. The Vm and PI values in every FA in all patients were normal compared to the values in the non-FAs (p=0.67 and 0.38, respectively). Our results suggest that AVM vessels with high Vm and low PI values return to normal as the nidus of the AVM is obliterated after GKS. Although there was a trend toward a reduction of the Vm values after obliteration, this trend was not significant, except when the < 12 month subgroup was compared to the 12-24 month subgroup.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 69 patients treated with GK for cerebral AVMs between November 2003 and April 2009, recording clinical data, treatment parameters, and AVM obliteration rates in order to assess our effectiveness with GK in treating these lesions. RESULTS: Ten patients were lost to follow-up. Presentations included: seizure (24), hemorrhage (18), persistent headache (12), progressing neurological signs (10), and incidental (9). In 24 patients (34.8%) treatment planning consisted of digital subtraction angiography (DSA), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomogram (CT) angiography (CTA). Currently we rely predominantly on CTA and/or MRI scanning only. Fourty-one patients have been followed for a minimum of 3 years; average age 40.9 yr., 58.5% males. Average dose at the 50% isodose line was 20.3 Gy (range 16 to 26.4 Gy). Obliteration was observed in 87.8% by MRI, CT, or DSA. Not all obliteration was confirmed by DSA. Complications occurred in 12 of 59 (20.3%) patients, and in 11 of 41 (26.8%) with 3 year follow-up. Major (temporary) complications for the 59 included symptomatic cerebral edema (7), seizure (2), and hemorrhage (1).

38967428,Multistaged Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Complex Large Lobar Arteriovenous Malformations: A Case Series.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Although stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has well defined outcomes in the management of smaller-volume arteriovenous malformations (AVM), this report evaluates the outcomes when SRS is used for large-volume (≥10 cc) lobar AVMs. METHODS: Between 1990 and 2022, a cohort of 1325 patients underwent Leksell Gamma Knife SRS for brain AVMs. Among these, 40 patients (25 women; median age: 37 years) with large lobar AVMs underwent volume-staged SRS followed by additional SRS procedures if needed (2-5 procedures). The patients presented with diverse AVM locations and Spetzler-Martin Grades. Before SRS, 16 patients underwent a total of 43 embolization procedures. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 73 months, 20 patients achieved AVM obliteration. The 3, 5, and 10-year obliteration rates were 9.3%, 15.3%, and 53.3%, respectively. During the latency interval between the first SRS procedure and the last follow-up, 11 patients had intracerebral hemorrhages (ICH) and 6 developed new neurological deficits unrelated to ICH. The postoperative hemorrhage risk after the first SRS was 13.8% at 3 years, 16.6% at 5 years, and 36.2% at 10 years. No hemorrhagic event was documented after confirmed obliteration. Compared with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores before SRS, the mRS improved or remained stable in 28 patients. Nine patients died during the observation interval. Five were related to ICH. CONCLUSION: These outcomes underscore both the potential effectiveness and the limitations of multistage SRS procedures for complex high-risk large volume AVMs in critical brain lobar locations. Most patients retained either stable or improved long-term mRS scores. During the latency interval from the first SRS until obliteration, achieved after two or more procedures, the risk of hemorrhage and treatment-related complications persists.",2025 Jan 1,2025,Neurosurgery,96,1,223-232,eng,True,10.1227/neu.0000000000003060;00006123-990000000-01269;10.1227/neu.0000000000003060,Journal Article,"Humans;*Radiosurgery/methods;Female;Male;Adult;Middle Aged;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery;Young Adult;Treatment Outcome;Adolescent;Aged;Child;Follow-Up Studies;Retrospective Studies;Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology;Embolization, Therapeutic/methods",

The aim of this multicenter retrospective cohort study was to compare the outcomes of different interventions with observation for unruptured high-grade dAVFs. METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed dAVF patients from 12 institutions participating in the Consortium for Dural Arteriovenous Fistula Outcomes Research (CONDOR). Patients with unruptured high-grade (Borden type II or III) dAVFs were included and categorized into four groups (observation, embolization, surgery, and stereotactic radiosurgery [SRS]) based on the initial management. The primary outcome was defined as the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at final follow-up. Secondary outcomes were good outcome (mRS scores 0-2) at final follow-up, symptomatic improvement, all-cause mortality, and dAVF obliteration. The outcomes of each intervention group were compared against those of the observation group as a reference, with adjustment for differences in baseline characteristics. RESULTS: The study included 415 dAVF patients, accounting for 29, 324, 43, and 19 in the observation, embolization, surgery, and SRS groups, respectively. The mean radiological and clinical follow-up durations were 21 and 25 months, respectively. Functional outcomes were similar for embolization, surgery, and SRS compared with observation. With observation as a reference, obliteration rates were higher after embolization (adjusted OR [aOR] 7.147, p = 0.010) and surgery (aOR 33.803, p < 0.001) and all-cause mortality was lower after embolization (imputed, aOR 0.171, p = 0.040). Hemorrhage rates per 1000 patient-years were 101 for observation versus 9, 22, and 0 for embolization (p = 0.022), surgery (p = 0.245), and SRS (p = 0.077), respectively. Nonhemorrhagic neurological deficit rates were similar between each intervention group versus observation. CONCLUSIONS: Embolization and surgery for unruptured high-grade dAVFs afforded a greater likelihood of obliteration than did observation. Embolization also reduced the risk of death and dAVF-associated hemorrhage compared with conservative management over a modest follow-up period. These findings support embolization as the first-line treatment of choice for appropriately selected unruptured Borden type II and III dAVFs.",2022 Apr 1,2022,Journal of neurosurgery,136,4,962-970,eng,False,10.3171/2021.1.JNS202799;10.3171/2021.1.JNS202799,"Journal Article;Multicenter Study;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural","*Central Nervous System Vascular Malformations/diagnostic imaging/surgery;*Embolization, Therapeutic;Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome",dural arteriovenous fistula;embolization;endovascular;high grade;intracranial;radiosurgery;surgery;unruptured;vascular disorders
23497623,Magnetic resonance spectroscopic study of radiogenic changes after radiosurgery of cerebral arteriovenous malformations with implications for the differential diagnosis of radionecrosis.,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of radionecrosis after radiosurgery is 5-20%. That radionecrosis after radiosurgery may be confused with a malignant tumor is a known phenomenon and problem. METHODS: Three similarly treated patients with cAVM, 1 patient with symptomatic radionecrosis and 2 patients with normal post-radiation MRI changes, were selected and studied in detail with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). 2 cAVM were located in eloquent locations and were classified as Spetzler-Martin grade (SM) III such that interdisciplinary radiosurgery was recommended; a third patient with a left frontal SM II cAVM refused surgery. 1 patient was male, and 2 were female. The patient's ages ranged from 38 to 62 years (median, 39 years). The nidus volume (= planning target volume = PTV) ranged from 2.75 to 6.89 ccm (median, 6.41 ccm). The single dose was 20 Gy at the isocenter of the PTV encompassing the 80 - 90% isodose. The median follow-up period was 20 months (range, 16 - 84 months). Toxicities were evaluated with the Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) for adverse events version 3.0. RESULTS: No patient suffered a bleeding from cAVM during the study period. A complete nidus occlusion was shown in all patients with time-resolved MRA. All patients showed radiogenic MRI changes, 1 patient showed excessive radionecrosis. This patient was oligosymptomatic and under temporary corticoid therapy symptoms resolved completely.Following patterns associated with radionecrosis in the MRS studies were identified in our collective: 2D spectroscopic imaging (2D-SI) revealed much lower concentrations of metabolites in the lesion as compared to contralateral healthy tissue in all patients. Whereas regions with regular post-radiosurgery effects showed almost normal levels of Cho and a Cho/Cr ratio < 2.0, regions with radionecrosis were characterized by increased lipid levels and a Cho/Cr ratio > 2.0 in conjunction with decreased absolute levels of all metabolites, especially of Cr and NAA. CONCLUSIONS: MRS is an increasingly valuable tool for the differential diagnosis of radiation reactions. Specific patterns of MRS spectra in radionecrosis were identified; in synopsis with clinical parameters, these changes have to be taken into account to avoid misdiagnosis.",2013 Mar 7,2013,"Radiation oncology (London, England)",8,,54,eng,False,10.1186/1748-717X-8-54;1748-717X-8-54;10.1186/1748-717X-8-54,Journal Article,"Adult;Aged;Diagnosis, Differential;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Angiography;Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/*methods;Male;Middle Aged;Necrosis;Radiation Injuries/*diagnosis;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects",
23127781,Effect of the embolization material in the dose calculation for stereotactic radiosurgery of arteriovenous malformations.,"It is reported in the literature that the material used in an embolization of an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) can attenuate the radiation beams used in stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) up to 10% to 15%. The purpose of this work is to assess the dosimetric impact of this attenuating material in the SRS treatment of embolized AVMs, using Monte Carlo simulations assuming clinical conditions. A commercial Monte Carlo dose calculation engine was used to recalculate the dose distribution of 20 AVMs previously planned with a pencil beam dose calculation algorithm. Dose distributions were compared using the following metrics: average, minimal and maximum dose of AVM, and 2D gamma index. The effect in the obliteration rate was investigated using radiobiological models. It was found that the dosimetric impact of the embolization material is less than 1.0 Gy in the prescription dose to the AVM for the 20 cases studied. The impact in the obliteration rate is less than 4.0%. There is reported evidence in the literature that embolized AVMs treated with SRS have low obliteration rates. This work shows that there are dosimetric implications that should be considered in the final treatment decisions for embolized AVMs.",2013 Summer,2013,Medical dosimetry : official journal of the American Association of Medical,38,2,110-4,eng,False,S0958-3947(12)00142-2;10.1016/j.meddos.2012.07.009;S0958-3947(12)00142-2;10.1016/j.meddos.2012.07.009,Clinical Trial;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Combined Modality Therapy;Embolization, Therapeutic/*methods;Female;Hemostatics/*therapeutic use;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*therapy;Male;Radiometry/*methods;Radiosurgery/*methods;*Radiotherapy Dosage;Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted/*methods;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Young Adult",
22099050,Planned two-fraction proton beam stereotactic radiosurgery for high-risk inoperable cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate patients with high-risk cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), based on eloquent brain location or large size, who underwent planned two-fraction proton stereotactic radiosurgery (PSRS). METHODS AND MATERIALS: From 1991 to 2009, 59 patients with high-risk cerebral AVMs received two-fraction PSRS. Median nidus volume was 23 cc (range, 1.4-58.1 cc), 70% of cases had nidus volume ≥ 14 cc, and 34% were in critical locations (brainstem, basal ganglia). Median AVM score based on age, AVM size, and location was 3.19 (range, 0.9-6.9). Many patients had prior surgery or embolization (40%) or prior PSRS (12%). The most common prescription was 16 Gy radiobiologic equivalent (RBE) in two fractions, prescribed to the 90% isodose. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 56.1 months, 9 patients (15%) had total and 20 patients (34%) had partial obliteration. Patients with total obliteration received higher total dose than those with partial or no obliteration (mean dose, 17.6 vs. 15.5 Gy (RBE), p = 0.01). Median time to total obliteration was 62 months (range, 23-109 months), and 5-year actuarial rate of partial or total obliteration was 33%. Five-year actuarial rate of hemorrhage was 22% (95% confidence interval, 12.5%-36.8%) and 14% (n = 8) suffered fatal hemorrhage. Lesions with higher AVM scores were more likely to hemorrhage (p = 0.024) and less responsive to radiation (p = 0.026). The most common complication was Grade 1 headache acutely (14%) and long term (12%). One patient developed a Grade 2 generalized seizure disorder, and two had mild neurologic deficits. CONCLUSIONS: High-risk AVMs can be safely treated with two-fraction PSRS, although total obliteration rate is low and patients remain at risk for future hemorrhage. Future studies should include higher doses or a multistaged PSRS approach for lesions more resistant to obliteration with radiation.",2012 Jun 1,2012,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",83,2,533-41,eng,True,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2011.08.003;S0360-3016(11)03110-5;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2011.08.003,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Basal Ganglia/abnormalities/blood supply;Brain Stem/abnormalities/blood supply;Child;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Headache Disorders, Secondary/etiology;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous;Intracranial Hemorrhages/etiology/mortality;Male;Middle Aged;Proton Therapy;Radiosurgery/adverse effects/*methods;Radiotherapy Dosage;Risk;Rupture, Spontaneous/complications/mortality;Young Adult",
25884263,"Angiographic, hemodynamic, and histological changes in an animal model of brain arteriovenous malformations treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery.","OBJECT: Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are a major cause of stroke. Many AVMs are effectively obliterated by stereotactic radiosurgery, but such treatment for lesions larger than 3 cm is not as effective. Understanding the responses to radiosurgery may lead to new biological enhancements to this treatment modality. The aim of the present study was to investigate the hemodynamic, morphological, and histological effects of Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) in an animal model of brain AVM. METHODS: An arteriovenous fistula was created by anastomosing the left external jugular vein to the side of the common carotid artery in 64 male Sprague-Dawley rats (weight 345 ± 8.8 g). Six weeks after AVM creation, 32 rats were treated with a single dose of GKS (20 Gy); 32 animals received sham radiation. Eight irradiated and 8 control animals were studied at each specified time point (1, 3, 6, and 12 weeks) for hemodynamic, morphological, and histological characterization. RESULTS: Two AVMs showed partial angiographic obliteration at 6 weeks. Angiography revealed complete obliteration in 3 irradiated rats at 12 weeks. Blood flow in the ipsilateral proximal carotid artery (p < 0.001) and arterialized jugular vein (p < 0.05) was significantly lower in the irradiated group than in the control group. The arterialized vein's external diameter was significantly smaller in GKS-treated animals at 6 (p < 0.05) and 12 (p < 0.001) weeks. Histological changes included subendothelial cellular proliferation and luminal narrowing in GKS-treated animals. Neither luminal obliteration nor thrombus formation was identified at any of the time points in either irradiated or nonirradiated animals. CONCLUSIONS: GKS produced morphological, angiographic, and histological changes in the model of AVM as early as 6 weeks after treatment.

21501954,Linac-based stereotactic radiosurgery for brain arteriovenous malformations.,"AIMS: Most papers dealing with radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) present the results of gamma-knife treatment, whereas linac radiosurgery is becoming increasingly popular. Moreover, there is still much uncertainty about the rationale of combined endovascular and radiosurgical treatment. The aims of this study were to evaluate obliteration and rebleeding rates, and to determine factors influencing obliteration and adverse effects after linac-based stereotactic radiosurgery for cerebral AVMs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Records of 62 consecutive patients were analysed. Thirty-one had partial embolisation, five surgery, 29 had no prior treatment. The mean follow-up was 28.4 months. The mean volume treated was 11.7cm(3) and included embolised portions of AVMs. Actuarial obliteration rates and annual bleeding hazard rates after radiosurgery were calculated using Kaplan-Meier survival and life table analyses. RESULTS: Actuarial obliteration rates after 1, 2 and 3 years of follow-up were 17, 36 and 40%, respectively. Prior embolisation did not influence the obliteration rate. In 77.3% of patients, obliteration occurred during the first 2 years of follow-up. Annual bleeding hazard rates after stereotactic radiosurgery were 3.4 and 1.1% during the first and second year of follow-up, respectively. Non-symptomatic imaging abnormalities were detected in 33.9% of patients after a median time of 8.8 months. The Spetzler-Martin grade, AVM score, radiation dose, volume and AVM nidus < 3cm significantly influenced the probability of obliteration. A dose less than 15Gy significantly reduced the probability of obliteration. CONCLUSION: At least a 3 year follow-up is required to accurately assess the outcome. The best effects of the treatment are achieved for small (<3cm), low-grade lesions with a low AVM score.

28414573,Phosphatidylserine Translocation after Radiosurgery in an Animal Model of Arteriovenous Malformation.,"Phosphatidylserine (PS) is asymmetrically distributed across the plasma membrane, located predominantly on the inner leaflet in healthy cells. Translocation of PS to the outer leaflet makes it available as a target for biological therapies. We examined PS translocation after radiosurgery in an animal model of brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM). An arteriovenous fistula was created by end-to-side anastomosis of the left external jugular vein to the common carotid artery in 6-week-old, male Sprague Dawley rats. Six weeks after AVM creation, 15 rats underwent Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery receiving a single 15 Gy dose to the margin of the fistula; 15 rats received sham treatment. Externalization of PS was examined by intravenous injection of a PS-specific near-infrared probe, PSVue-794, and in vivo fluorescence optical imaging at 1, 7, 21, 42, 63 and 84 days postirradiation. Fluorescent signaling indicative of PS translocation to the luminal cell surface accumulated in the AVM region, in both irradiated and nonirradiated animals, at all time points. Fluorescence was localized specifically to the AVM region and was not present in any other anatomical sites. Translocated PS increased over time in irradiated rats (P < 0.001) but not in sham-irradiated rats and this difference reached statistical significance at day 84 (P < 0.05). In summary, vessels within the mature rat AVM demonstrate elevated PS externalization compared to normal vessels. A single dose of ionizing radiation can increase PS externalization in a time-dependent manner. Strict localization of PS externalization within the AVM region suggests that stereotactic radiosurgery can serve as an effective priming agent and PS may be a suitable candidate for vascular-targeting approaches to AVM treatment.",2017 Jun,2017,Radiation research,187,6,701-707,eng,False,10.1667/RR14646.1;10.1667/RR14646.1,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Animals;Biological Transport, Active/radiation effects;Cell Membrane/*metabolism/pathology/*radiation effects;Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*metabolism/pathology/*radiotherapy;Male;Membrane Proteins/metabolism;Phosphatidylserines/*metabolism;Radiosurgery/*methods;Radiotherapy Dosage;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Treatment Outcome",
18306132,Patients treated by Model-C gamma knife with APS are less exposed to non-therapeutic irradiation.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the defocused (non-therapeutic) irradiation between the Model-C gamma knife with the automatic positioning system (APS) and with the non-APS mode. METHODS: 41 males and 59 females (mean age: 54 years) had the following pathologies: 38 benign tumors, 43 malignant tumors, 16 vascular lesions, and 3 trigeminal neuralgias. These included 192 lesions (mean volume: 4.8 mL), 61 (32%) of them were located deeply. The radiation treatment time needed and the choice of helmets and shots for each lesion were analyzed. The inter-group difference is analyzed using the one-way ANOVA method. RESULTS: The APS mode could be applied alone in 79 patients or was always possible in nearly 95% of patients with benign lesions. APS-treatment failed in three patients due to unexpected collisions, and the other 18 harbored some advanced peripheral metastatic lesions. The non-APS mode required 47% more defocused time than the pure APS mode (1.1 vs. 0.75 minutes, p<0.01) before starting the next shot. Patients treated by the APS mode are exposed to a 70% less (p<0.05) unplanned, defocused irradiation dose than those by the non-APS mode. Although there is a tendency in the APS group to use fewer helmets but more shots per lesion for achieving an optimal dosimetry, there was no difference in the averaged defocused time per patient. CONCLUSIONS: The APS system makes GK radiosurgery run more smoothly, rapidly, comfortable and safer than ever. It improves the design of more conformal dose plans, especially for benign lesions, and the patients will also be exposed to less unnecessary radiation doses.",2008 Feb,2008,Minimally invasive neurosurgery : MIN,51,1,47-50,eng,False,10.1055/s-2007-1022537;10.1055/s-2007-1022537,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Brain/pathology/physiopathology/radiation effects;Brain Neoplasms/pathology/*surgery;Cerebral Arteries/abnormalities/pathology/radiation effects;Cerebral Veins/abnormalities/pathology/radiation effects;Child;Child, Preschool;Clinical Protocols;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/pathology/*surgery;Intraoperative Complications;Male;Middle Aged;Monitoring, Intraoperative/instrumentation/methods;Preoperative Care;Radiation Dosage;Radiation Effects;Radiosurgery/*instrumentation/methods/statistics & numerical data;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;Trigeminal Neuralgia/pathology/*surgery",
16944119,Stereotactic radiosurgery for brain arteriovenous malformations: quantitative MR assessment of nidal response at 1 year and angiographic factors predicting early obliteration.,"INTRODUCTION: We investigated the role of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in the early follow-up of patients after stereotactic radiosurgery (STRS) for cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and determined the influence of individual morphological factors of AVMs in early response to treatment. METHODS: A group of 40 patients (41 AVMs) consented to a dedicated 1.5-T MR protocol 12 months after receiving STRS for a brain AVM. In addition to standard spin echo sequences, 3-D contrast-enhanced sliding interleaved Ky MRA (CE-SLINKY) and dynamic time-resolved subtraction angiography (MR-DSA) were performed. Nidal volumes were calculated using CE-SLINKY data in patients with a persisting arteriovenous shunt. Planning angiographic data was investigated in all 40 patients. The following AVM factors were used in the statistical analysis to determine their role in nidus obliteration: (1) maximum linear dimension, (2) nidal volume, (3) AVM location (4) nidal morphology, (5) venous drainage, (6) ""high-flow angiographic change"", (7) prior embolization, and (8) dose reduction. RESULTS: Complete nidal obliteration was found in 9 patients, 26 showed greater than 50% nidal reduction and 6 had less than 50%. Two AVM factors, venous drainage and AVM location, were found to significantly correlate with rate of obliteration. CONCLUSION: We successfully demonstrated the use of MRA to quantitatively assess the response of AVMs to STRS. Two AVM factors, venous drainage and AVM location were found to correlate with rate of obliteration prior to the application of the Bonferroni correction, but if this more rigorous statistical test was applied then none of the factors was found to be significant.",2006 Nov,2006,Neuroradiology,48,11,821-9,eng,False,10.1007/s00234-006-0131-y,Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;*Cerebral Angiography;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnosis/*surgery;*Magnetic Resonance Angiography;Male;Middle Aged;Predictive Value of Tests;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Time Factors;Treatment Outcome,
32001069,Dosimetric comparison of iPlan(Ⓡ) Pencil Beam (PB) and Monte Carlo (MC) algorithms in stereotactic radiosurgery/radiotherapy (SRS/SRT) plans of intracranial arteriovenous malformations.,"Stereotactic radiosurgery/radiotherapy (SRS/SRT) is a hypofractionated treatment where accurate dose calculation is of prime importance. The accuracy of the dose calculation depends on the treatment planning algorithm. This study is a retrospective dosimetric comparison of iPlan(Ⓡ) Monte Carlo (MC) and Pencil Beam (PB) algorithms in SRS/SRT plans of cranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). PB plans of 60 AVM patients who were already treated using 6 MV photons from a linear accelerator were selected and divided into 2 groups. Group-I consists of 30 patients who have undergone embolization procedure with high density Onyx(Ⓡ) prior to radiosurgery whereas Group-II had 30 patients who did not have embolization. These plans were recalculated with MC algorithm while keeping parameters like beam orientation, multileaf collimator (MLC) positions, MLC margin, prescription dose, and monitor units constant. Several treatment coverage parameters, isodose volumes, plan quality metrics, dose to organs at risk, and integral dose were used for comparing the 2 algorithms. The isodose distribution generated by the 2 algorithms was also compared with gamma analysis using 1%/1 mm criterion. The difference between the 2 groups as well as the differences in dose calculation by PB and MC algorithms were tested for significance using independent t-test and paired t-test respectively at 5% level of significance. The results of the independent t-test showed that there is no significant difference between the Group-I and Group-II patients for PB as well as MC algorithm due to the presence of high density embolization material. However, results of the paired t-test showed that the differences between the PB and MC algorithms were significant for several parameters analyzed in both groups of patients. The gamma analysis results also showed differences in the dose calculated by the 2 algorithms especially in the low dose regions. The significant differences between the 2 algorithms are probably due to the incorrect representation of the loss of lateral charged particle equilibrium and lateral broadening of small photon beams by PB algorithm. MC algorithms are generally considered not essential for dose calculations for target volumes located in the brain. This study demonstrates PB algorithm may not be sufficiently accurate to predict dose distributions for small fields where there is loss of LCPE. The lateral broadening due to the loss of LCPE as predicted by the MC algorithm could be the main reason for significant differences in the parameters compared. Hence, an accurate MC algorithm if available may prove valuable for intracranial SRS treatment planning of such benign lesions where the long life expectancy of patients makes accurate dosimetry critical.",2020 Autumn,2020,Medical dosimetry : official journal of the American Association of Medical,45,3,225-234,eng,False,S0958-3947(19)30132-3;10.1016/j.meddos.2019.12.006;S0958-3947(19)30132-3;10.1016/j.meddos.2019.12.006,Comparative Study;Journal Article,"Adult;*Algorithms;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Monte Carlo Method;Particle Accelerators;*Radiation Dosage;Radiometry;*Radiosurgery;*Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted;Retrospective Studies",Arteriovenous malformation;Embolization;Monte Carlo;Pencil beam;Stereotactic radiosurgery
32206904,The current clinical picture of cerebral proliferative angiopathy: systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Cerebral proliferative angiopathy (CPA) is a rare subset of arteriovenous malformations (AVM). It has unique clinical presentation, angiographic characteristics, and pathophysiology which often brings challenges for the treatment. We aimed to define its epidemiology, pathophysiology are unknown, and best management strategies. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. MEDLINE was searched for articles regarding CPA. Extracted data included epidemiological, clinical, and angiographical characteristics, treatment, and outcomes. Treatment was classified as conservative, radiosurgery, endovascular, decompression, and indirect vascularization. A meta-analytical approach was employed for description of the data as study-size adjusted percentages or weighted means, as appropriate. RESULTS: Thirty-three studies were analyzed, rendering a total 95 cases-half of which came from a single study. Patients were predominantly young (mean 23 years old) and female (60.0%) presenting with headaches (44.9%), seizures (37.1%), or transient ischemic attacks (33.7%). Hemorrhage was present in 18.0%, but rebleeding rates were as high as 67%. The majority of nidus were > 6 cm (52.5%) with hemispheric extension (73.0%). Capillary angioectatic appearance (85.7%), transdural supply (62.5%), and deep venous drainage (73.0%) were also frequent features. Most patients were treated conservatively (54.4%), followed by endovascular (34.2%). Indirect vascularization and radiosurgery were attempted in five and two patients, respectively. Mean follow-up was 110.8 patient-years. Neurological status improved in 50.7%, remained stable in 40.2%, and worsened in 9.0%. CONCLUSIONS: Conservative and endovascular treatments seem adequate interventions, despite limited evidence. Complementary techniques can be used in patients throughout disease history, according to symptom-based, individualized approach.

This study investigated annual hemorrhage rates and nidus obliteration rates, and the factors affecting them, in pediatric AVMs treated with GKRS. METHODS: We examined 189 pediatric AVM patients (age ≤15 years) who underwent GKRS and had at least 12 months of follow-up. The Spetzler-Martin (S-M) grade was I in 29 patients (15%), II in 57 (30%), III in 82 (43%), IV in 16 (9%), and V in 5 (3%). The median treatment volume was 2.2 cm(3), and the median marginal dose was 20 Gy. RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 136 months. During a cumulative latency period to nidus obliteration of 813 years, 23 hemorrhages occurred, resulting in an annual post-GKRS hemorrhage rate of 2.8%. The cumulative hemorrhage rates after GKRS were 3.3%, 8.5%, and 11.9% at 3, 5, and 10 years, respectively. Higher S-M grade was significantly associated with intracranial hemorrhages during the latency period (P < 0.001). The actuarial nidus obliteration rates with repeated GKRS were 64% and 81% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. Absence of pre-GKRS embolization (P = 0.023) and higher marginal dose (P = 0.029) were significant factors predicting nidus obliteration. CONCLUSIONS: GKRS is a reasonable treatment option in pediatric AVMs to prevent future hemorrhages. Because higher S-M grade AVMs are more likely to hemorrhage during the latency period, a combined therapy with endovascular embolization should be considered to prevent AVM rupture.",2019 Jun,2019,World neurosurgery,126,,e1518-e1525,eng,False,S1878-8750(19)30856-3;10.1016/j.wneu.2019.03.176;S1878-8750(19)30856-3;10.1016/j.wneu.2019.03.176,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Child;Child, Preschool;Embolization, Therapeutic;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/diagnostic;Intracranial Hemorrhages/epidemiology/etiology/prevention & control;Kaplan-Meier Estimate;Male;Radiosurgery/*methods;Retrospective Studies;Salvage Therapy;Survival Analysis;Treatment Outcome",Gamma knife;Intracranial arteriovenous malformation;Intracranial hemorrhage;Pediatric;Stereotactic radiosurgery;Stroke;Vascular malformation

23258511,Multistaged volumetric management of large arteriovenous malformations.,"We sought to define the long-term outcomes and risks of arteriovenous malformation (AVM) management using 2 or more stages of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for symptomatic large-volume AVMs unsuitable for surgery. Two decades ago, we prospectively began to stage anatomical components in order to deliver higher single doses to AVMs>10 cm3 in volume. Forty-seven patients with large AVMs underwent volume-staged SRS. The median interval between the two SRS procedures was 4.9 months (range, 3-14 months). The median nidus volume was 11.5 cm3 (range, 4.0-26 cm3) in the first stage of SRS and 9.5 cm3 in the second. The median margin dose was 16 Gy (range, 13-18 Gy) for both SRS stages. The actuarial rates of total obliteration after 2-staged SRS were 7, 20, 28 and 36% at 3, 4, 5 and 10 years, respectively. Sixteen patients needed additional SRS at a median interval of 61 months (range, 33-113 months) after the 2-staged SRS. After repeat procedure(s), the eventual obliteration rate was 66% at 10 years. The cumulative rates of AVM hemorrhage after SRS were 4.3, 8.6, 13.5 and 36.0% at 1, 2, 5 and 10 years, respectively. Symptomatic adverse radiation effects were detected in 13% of patients.

19445567,Validation of the radiosurgery-based arteriovenous malformation score in a large linear accelerator radiosurgery experience.,"OBJECT: The radiosurgery-based arteriovenous malformation (AVM) score (RBAS) is a grading system designed to predict patient outcomes after Gamma Knife surgery for AVMs. This study seeks to validate independently the predictive nature of the RBAS, not only after single treatment but for retreatment, and to assess the overall outcome regardless of number of radiosurgeries. METHODS: The authors analyzed 403 patients treated with linear accelerator (LINAC) radiosurgery for AVMs between May 1988 and June 2008. The AVM scores were determined by the following equation: AVM score = (0.1 x volume in cm(3)) + (0.02 x age in years) + (0.3 x location). The location values are as follows: frontal/temporal = 0, parietal/occipital/corpus callosum/cerebellar = 1, and basal ganglia/thalamus/brainstem = 2. RESULTS: Testing demonstrated that the RBAS correlated with excellent outcomes after single or repeat radiosurgery (p < 0.001 for both variables). One hundred sixty-two (49%) of 330 patients had excellent outcomes (obliteration without deficit) after a single treatment. Excellent outcomes were achieved in 74, 64, 50, and 11% of patients with AVM scores of < 1.0 (Group 1), between 1.0 and < 1.8 (Group 2), between 1.8 and < 2.5 (Group 3), and >or= 2.5 (Group 4), respectively. Fifty-one patients (70%) obtained radiosurgical cure and 46 (63%) achieved excellent outcomes after repeat radiosurgery. Of these, 100% achieved excellent outcomes in Group 1, 70% did so in Group 2, 47% in Group 3, and 14% in Group 4. The RBAS correlated with excellent outcomes after overall treatment (p < 0.001). Two hundred seventy-seven patients (69%) obtained AVM obliteration, and 62% achieved excellent outcomes. In Group 1, 87% achieved excellent outcomes, 75% did so in Group 2, 61% in Group 3, and 24% in Group 4.

19568460,Detection of residual brain arteriovenous malformations after radiosurgery: diagnostic accuracy of contrast-enhanced three-dimensional time of flight MR angiography at 3.0 Tesla.,"OBJECTIVE: Although three-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (3D TOF-MRA) is used frequently as a follow-up tool to assess the response of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) after radiosurgery, the diagnostic accuracy of 3D TOF-MRA is not well known. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of contrast-enhanced 3D TOF-MRA at 3.0 Tesla for the detection of residual AVMs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 32 AVMs from 32 patients who had been treated with radiosurgery (males/females: 21/11; average patient age, 33.1 years). The time interval between radiosurgery and MRA was an average of 35.3 months (range, 12-88 months). Three-dimensional TOF-MRA was obtained at a magnetic field strength of 3.0 Tesla after infusion of contrast media, with a measured voxel size of 0.40 x 0.80 x 1.4 (0.45) mm(3) and a reconstructed voxel size of 0.27 x 0.27 x 0.70 (0.05) mm(3) after zero-filling. X-ray angiography was performed as the reference of standard within six months after MRA (an average of two months). To determine the presence of a residual AVM, the source images of 3D TOF-MRA were independently reviewed, focusing on the presence of abnormally hyperintense fine tangled or tubular structures with continuity as seen on consecutive slices by two observers blinded to the X-ray angiography results. RESULTS: A residual AVM was identified in 10 patients (10 of 32, 31%) on X-ray angiography. The inter-observer agreement for MRA was excellent (kappa= 0.813). For the detection of a residual AVM after radiosurgery as determined by observer 1 and observer 2, the source images of MRA had an overall sensitivity of 100%/90% (10 of 10, 9 of 10), specificity of 68%/68% (15 of 22, 15 of 22), positive predictive value of 59%/56% (10 of 17, 9 of 16), negative predictive value of 100%/94% (15 of 15, 15 of 16) and diagnostic accuracy of 78%/75% (25 of 32, 24 of 32), respectively.

37068327,Embolization as stand-alone strategy for pediatric low-grade brain arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the safety and efficacy of endovascular embolization as first-line stand-alone strategy for the treatment of low-grade brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) (Spetzler Martin [SM] grade I and II) in pediatric patients. In addition, we assessed the predictors of procedure-related complications and radiographic complete obliteration in a single session. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a single center retrospective cohort study of all pediatric (≤18 years) patients who underwent embolization as a stand-alone strategy for low-grade bAVMs between 2010 and 2022. Safety was measured by procedure-related complications and mortality. Efficacy was defined as complete angiographic obliteration after the last embolization session. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients (41 females; median age 14 years) underwent a total of 102 embolization sessions. There were 24 (35%) SM grade I lesions and 44 (65%) grade II. Six procedure-related complications (5.8% of procedures) were observed and no deaths were reported. All the complications were intraoperative nidus ruptures. A single draining vein was the only significant predictor of procedure-related complications (OR=0.10; 95% CI 0.01 - 0.72; p=0.048). Complete angiographic obliteration was achieved in 44 patients (65%). In 35 patients (51%) the bAVM was completely occluded in one session. The bAVM nidal size was a predictor of complete obliteration in one session (OR=0.44; 95% CI, 0.21-0.80; p=0.017).

16060250,Cranial and spinal dural arteriovenous malformations and fistulas: an update.,"Awareness of a potential arteriovenous fistula is critical for diagnosis of cranial as well as spinal fistulas. The natural history of cranial and spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas has been clarified during the last decade and interdisciplinary therapies have experienced a substantial development recently. The classification of Cognard & Merland is now the most widely accepted one for cranial dural AVF. It is based on the degree of flow reversal in the sinuses and cortical veins and reflects well the natural history of the different lesions and serves as basis for therapeutic indications. Several studies have defined the annual bleeding risk of cranial dural fistulas between 1.8 and 15%, depending on the pattern of venous drainage and initial symptomatology. Surgical, endovascular and radiosurgical methods must be selectively chosen for the treatment. The risk associated with surgical or endovascular treatment of benign fistulas is higher than the risk of eliminating fistulas that have already led to cortical venous reflux. Transvenous endovascular occlusion or surgical disconnection of draining veins is the treatment of first choice for cranial and spinal dAVF with venous flow reversal. Benign cranial dural arteriovenous fistulas are a developing indication for radiosurgery.",2005,2005,Acta neurochirurgica.

22077450,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations, Part 5: management of brainstem arteriovenous malformations.","OBJECT: In this paper, the authors' goal was to define the long-term outcomes and risks of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the medulla, pons, and midbrain. METHODS: Between 1987 and 2006, the authors performed Gamma Knife surgery in 996 patients with brain AVMs; 67 patients had AVMs in the brainstem. In this series, 51 patients (76%) had a prior hemorrhage. The median target volume was 1.4 cm(3) (range 0.1-13.4 cm(3)). The median margin dose was 20 Gy (range 14-25.6 Gy). RESULTS: Obliteration of the AVMs was eventually documented in 35 patients at a median follow-up of 73 months (range 6-269 months). The actuarial rates of documentation of total obliteration were 41%, 70%, 70%, and 76% at 3, 4, 5, and 10 years, respectively. Higher rates of AVM obliteration were associated only with a higher margin dose. Four patients (6%) suffered a hemorrhage during the latency period, and 2 patients died. The rate of AVM hemorrhage after SRS was 3.0%, 3.0%, and 5.8% at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively. The overall annual hemorrhage rate was 1.9%. Permanent neurological deficits due to adverse radiation effects (AREs) developed in 7 patients (10%) after SRS, and a delayed cyst developed in 2 patients (3%). One patient died at an outside institution with symptoms of AREs and unrecognized hydrocephalus. Higher 12-Gy volumes and higher Spetzler-Martin grades were associated with a higher risk of symptomatic AREs. Ten of 22 patients who had ocular dysfunction before SRS had improvement, 9 were unchanged, and 3 were worse due to AREs. Eight of 14 patients who had hemiparesis before SRS improved, 5 were unchanged, and 1 was worse. CONCLUSIONS: Although hemorrhage after obliteration did not occur in this series, patients remained at risk during the latency interval until obliteration occurred. Thirty-eight percent of the patients who had neurological deficits due to prior hemorrhage improved.

25634818,Arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging: toward noninvasive diagnosis and follow-up of pediatric brain arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECT Arterial spin labeling (ASL)-MRI is becoming a routinely used sequence for ischemic strokes, as it quantifies cerebral blood flow (CBF) without the need for contrast injection. As brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are highflow vascular abnormalities, increased CBF can be identified inside the nidus or draining veins. The authors aimed to analyze the relevance of ASL-MRI in the diagnosis and follow-up of children with brain AVM. METHODS The authors performed a retrospective analysis of 21 patients who had undergone digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and pseudo-continuous ASL-MRI for the diagnosis or follow-up of brain AVM after radiosurgery or embolization. They compared the AVM nidus location between ASL-MRI and 3D contrast-enhanced T1 MRI, as well as the CBF values obtained in the nidus (CBFnidus) and the normal cortex (CBFcortex) before and after treatment. RESULTS The ASL-MRI correctly demonstrated the nidus location in all cases. Nidal perfusion (mean CBFnidus 137.7 ml/100 mg/min) was significantly higher than perfusion in the contralateral normal cortex (mean CBFcortex 58.6 ml/100 mg/min; p < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney test). Among 3 patients followed up after embolization, a reduction in both AVM size and CBF values was noted. Among 5 patients followed up after radiosurgery, a reduction in the nidus size was observed, whereas CBFnidus remained higher than CBFcortex. CONCLUSIONS In this study, ASL-MRI revealed nidus location and patency after treatment thanks to its ability to demonstrate focal increased CBF values. Absolute quantification of CBF values could be relevant in the follow-up of pediatric brain AVM after partial treatment, although this must be confirmed in larger prospective trials.",2015 Apr,2015,Journal of neurosurgery.

33973031,Living with a Brain AVM: A Quality of Life Assessment.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVM) are uncommon vascular lesions with the risk of hemorrhage, epileptic seizures, neurological deficits, and headache. Comparing the risks of the natural history and that of preventive treatment, a recent study has found observation more beneficial than treatment for unruptured AVMs. This study, however, did not consider the long-term impact of carrying a brain AVM on everyday activities. In this study we analyzed the Quality Of Life (QOL) of patients with untreated AVMs, a measure increasingly used in clinical trials to asses this kind of impact. METHODS: We enrolled 36 patients with unruptured, untreated brain AVM from our hospital database and measured their QOL retrospectively using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. As a control group we used the results of the Research Report, a nationwide study based on the quality of life of 5534 healthy Hungarians in 2002. Due to the low number of cases, statistical analysis could not be made. RESULTS: Headache proved to be the most common AVM-related sign in our cohort (40%, n = 17), with a female predominance; neurological deficit was detected in 33% (n = 14), while epileptic seizures occurred in 26% (n = 11), more commonly affecting male subjects. Anxiety and discomfort seemed to be the most prevalent influencing factors on QOL, especially in the youngest age group (18-34 years). Female subjects showed a greater dependence than men in all age groups, though males had a more significant impairment in their usual activities. Older patients were affected more significantly in their self-care and usual activities compared with the younger population. CONCLUSIONS: Untreated AVMs have a significant negative impact on patients carrying unruptured brain AVMs, as proved by QOL assessment. Beside neurological deficits, this impact should also be considered in the therapeutic decision.",2021,2021,Acta neurochirurgica.

Volume-staged stereotactic radiosurgery (VS-SRS) provides an effective option for these high-risk lesions, but optimizing treatment for these recalcitrant and rare lesions has proven difficult. METHODS: This is a multi-centered retrospective review of patients treated with a planned prospective volume staging approach to stereotactically treat the entire nidus of an AVM with volume stages separated by intervals of 3-6 months. A total of 9 radiosurgical centers treated 257 patients with VS-SRS between 1991 and 2016. We evaluated near complete response (nCR), obliteration, cure, and overall survival. RESULTS: With a median age of 33 years old at the time of first SRS volume stage, patients received 2-4 total volume stages and a median follow up of 5.7 years after VS-SRS. The median total AVM nidus volume was 23.25 cc (range: 7.7-94.4 cc) with a median margin dose per stage of 17 Gy (range: 12-20 Gy). Total AVM volume, margin dose per stage, compact nidus, lack of prior embolization, and lack of thalamic location involvement were all associated with improved outcomes. Dose >/= 17.5 Gy was strongly associated with improved rates of nCR, obliteration, and cure. With dose >/= 17.5 Gy, 5- and 10-year cure rates were 33.7% and 76.8% in evaluable patients compared to 23.7% and 34.7% of patients with 17 Gy and 6.4% and 20.6% with <17 Gy per volume-stage (p = 0.004). Obliteration rates in diffuse nidus architecture with <17 Gy were particularly poor with none achieving obliteration compared to 32.3% with doses >/= 17 Gy at 5 years (p = 0.007). Comparatively, lesions with a compact nidus architecture exhibited obliteration rates at 5 years were 10.7% vs 9.3% vs 26.6% for dose >17 Gy vs 17 Gy vs >/=17.5 Gy. CONCLUSION: VS-SRS is an option for upfront treatment of large AVMs. Higher dose was associated with improved rates of nCR, obliteration, and cure suggesting that larger volumetric responses may facilitate salvage therapy and optimize the chance for cure.",2020 Mar,2020,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic,144,,180-188,eng,True,S0167-8140(19)33108-1;10.1016/j.radonc.2019.09.019;S0167-8140(19)33108-1;10.1016/j.radonc.2019.09.019,Journal Article;Multicenter Study,Adult;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/radiotherapy/surgery;Prospective Studies;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome,AVM;Arteriovenous malformations;Radiosurgery

The management of this class of AVMs and the optimal treatment approach when intervention is indicated remain controversial. The authors report their experience with radiosurgery for the treatment of Grade III AVMs in a large cohort of patients. METHODS: All patients with Spetzler-Martin Grade III AVMs treated with radiosurgery at the University of Virginia over the 20-year span from 1989 to 2009 were identified. Patients who had less than 2 years of radiological follow-up and did not have evidence of complete obliteration during that period were excluded from the study, leaving 398 cases for analysis. The median patient age at treatment was 31 years. The most common presenting symptoms were hemorrhage (59%), seizure (20%), and headache (10%). The median AVM volume was 2.8 cm(3), and the median prescription dose was 20 Gy. The median radiological and clinical follow-up intervals were 54 and 68 months, respectively. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression analysis were used to identify factors associated with obliteration, postradiosurgery radiation-induced changes (RIC), and favorable outcome. RESULTS: Complete AVM obliteration was observed in 69% of Grade III AVM cases at a median time of 46 months after radiosurgery. The actuarial obliteration rates at 3 and 5 years were 38% and 60%, respectively. The obliteration rate was higher in ruptured AVMs than in unruptured ones (p < 0.001). Additionally, the obliteration rate for Grade III AVMs with small size (< 3 cm diameter), deep venous drainage, and location in eloquent cortex was higher than for the other subtypes (p < 0.001). Preradiosurgery AVM rupture (p = 0.016), no preradiosurgery embolization (p = 0.003), increased prescription dose (p < 0.001), fewer isocenters (p = 0.006), and a single draining vein (p = 0.018) were independent predictors of obliteration. The annual risk of postradiosurgery hemorrhage during the latency period was 1.7%. Two patients (0.5%) died of hemorrhage during the radiosurgical latency period. The rates of symptomatic and permanent RIC were 12% and 4%, respectively. Absence of preradiosurgery AVM rupture (p < 0.001) and presence of a single draining vein (p < 0.001) were independent predictors of RIC. Favorable outcome was observed in 63% of patients. Independent predictors of favorable outcome were no preradiosurgery hemorrhage (p = 0.014), increased prescription dose (p < 0.001), fewer isocenters (p = 0.014), deep location (p = 0.014), single draining vein (p = 0.001), and lower Virginia radiosurgery AVM scale score (p = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: Radiosurgery for Spetzler-Martin Grade III AVMs yields relatively high rates of obliteration with a low rate of adverse procedural events. Small and ruptured lesions are more likely to become obliterated after radiosurgery than large and unruptured ones.",2014 Apr,2014,Journal of neurosurgery,120,4,959-69,eng,True,10.3171/2013.12.JNS131041;10.3171/2013.12.JNS131041,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Cerebral Angiography;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;*Radiosurgery;Treatment Outcome",
15850928,Stereotactic radiosurgery for brain AVMs: role of interobserver variation in target definition on digital subtraction angiography.,"PURPOSE: We evaluated the extent of interobserver variation in contouring arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) on digital subtraction angiography (DSA) with respect to volume, spatial localization, and dosimetry and correlated our findings with the clinical outcome. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty-one patients who had undergone radiosurgery for brain AVMs were studied. Six clinicians independently contoured the nidus on the original DSA. As a measure of variation, the ratio between the volumes of agreement and the corresponding encompassing volumes, as well as the absolute positional shift between the individual target volumes were derived. Using the original treatment plan, the dosimetric coverage of the individually contoured volumes with standard collimators was compared with a similar plan using dynamic conformal arcs. RESULTS: The mean contoured nidus volume was 3.6 +/- 5.6 cm3. The mean agreement ratio was 0.45 +/- 0.18 for all possible pairs of observers. The mean absolute positional shift between individually contoured volumes was 2.8 +/- 2.6 mm. These differences were more marked in previously treated groups and tended to be more pronounced in those with treatment failure. The mean coverage of the individual volumes by the 80% prescription isodose was 88.1% +/- 3.2% using conventional collimators and 78.9% +/- 4.4% using dynamic conformal arcs (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Substantial interobserver variations exist when contouring brain AVMs on DSA for the purpose of radiosurgical planning. Such variations may result in underdosage to the AVM and, thereby, contribute to treatment failure. The consequences of contouring variations may increase with the use of more conformal radiosurgical techniques.",2005 May 1,2005,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",62,1,246-52,eng,False,S0360-3016(05)00097-0;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2004.12.080,Evaluation Study;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;*Angiography, Digital Subtraction;Child;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnostic imaging/surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Observer Variation;Radiosurgery;Treatment Outcome",
12419439,Intra-arterial CT-angiography for cerebral arteriovenous malformation--initial experiences for treatment planning of radiosurgery.,"PURPOSE: To clarify the feasibility and effectiveness of intra-arterial CT angiography (IACTA) for treatment planning of arteriovenous malformation radiosurgery. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A CT scanner installed in an angiographic examination room was used. Helical IACTA was performed in 22 patients during continuous intra-arterial infusion of contrast medium via the internal carotid or vertebral artery, and dynamic IACTA was performed in 20 of these patients with reconstruction at 0.2-s intervals. The dynamic IACTA was repeated for each 3- or 5-mm increment to encompass the nidus. Subtractions were performed in postembolization cases. A retrospective review of IACTA was performed to assess the effectiveness of dynamic scans. RESULTS: No complications related to the angiographic procedure or CT imaging were detected. High contrast enhancement was obtained for both helical and dynamic IACTA. In 18 of the 20 cases (90%), draining veins were separated from the nidus by using the enhancement patterns, and in 13 cases (65%), feeding arteries were separated. CONCLUSION: Dynamic IACTA added important information for target-volume determinations. Conventional CT and MRI could be omitted from the protocol, and the period that patients wore the frame was substantially shortened. We conclude that IACTA is a practical and useful method for radiosurgical treatment planning of arteriovenous malformations.",2002 Nov 15,2002,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",54,4,1121-33,eng,False,S0360301602030109;10.1016/s0360-3016(02)03010-9,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;*Cerebral Angiography;Child;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Angiography;Male;Middle Aged;*Radiosurgery;*Tomography, X-Ray Computed",
21869582,Risk of rebleeding in arteriovenous malformations due to impaired venous drainage after radiosurgery.,"A 27-year-old woman presented with rebleeding from an intracranial arteriovenous malformation (AVM) 6 years after radiosurgery. Cerebral angiography demonstrated venous drainage change into a single drainer and cortical reflux due to drainage occlusion into the superior sagittal sinus. During surgery, multiple small feeders thought to be occluded on preoperative angiography caused brain swelling, hindering resection of the AVM border plane. Flow changes after radiosurgery, especially impaired venous drainage, may have increased the tendency to rebleeding of the AVM. Scheduled angiography after radiosurgery is recommended, and retreatment for residual AVMs is preferable, especially if venous drainage change occurs.",2011,2011,Neurologia medico-chirurgica,51,8,585-7,eng,False,JST.JSTAGE/nmc/51.585;10.2176/nmc.51.585,Case Reports;Journal Article,Adult;Cerebral Angiography/methods;Cerebral Hemorrhage/diagnostic imaging/*etiology/physiopathology;Cerebral Veins/*abnormalities/physiopathology/*radiation effects;Cerebrovascular Circulation/physiology/radiation effects;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*complications/physiopathology/*surgery;Postoperative Hemorrhage/epidemiology/etiology/physiopathology;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects/methods;Risk Factors;Secondary Prevention,
38195249,Treatment outcomes for ARUBA-eligible brain arteriovenous malformations: a comparison of real-world data from the NVQI-QOD AVM registry with the ARUBA trial.,"BACKGROUND: Significant controversy exists about the management of unruptured cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Results from A Randomized Trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformations (ARUBA) suggested that intervention increases the risk of stroke/death compared with medical management. However, numerous study limitations raised concerns about the trial's generalizability. OBJECTIVE: To assess the rate of stroke/death and functional outcomes in ARUBA-eligible patients from a multicenter database, the Neurovascular Quality Initiative-Quality Outcomes Database (NVQI-QOD). METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of ARUBA-eligible patients who underwent intervention at 18 participating centers. The primary endpoint was stroke/death from any cause. Secondary endpoints included neurologic, systemic, radiographic, and functional outcomes. RESULTS: 173 ARUBA-eligible patients underwent intervention with median follow-up of 269 (25-722.5) days. Seventy-five patients received microsurgery±embolization, 37 received radiosurgery, and 61 received embolization. Baseline demographics, risk factors, and general AVM characteristics were similar between groups. A total of 15 (8.7%) patients experienced stroke/death with no significant difference in primary outcome between treatment modalities. Microsurgery±embolization was more likely to achieve AVM obliteration (P<0.001). Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrated no difference in overall death/stroke outcomes between the different treatment modalities' 5-year period (P=0.087). Additionally, when compared with the ARUBA interventional arm, our patients were significantly less likely to experience death/stroke (8.7% vs 30.7%; P<0.001) and functional impairment (mRS score ≥2 25.4% vs 46.2%; P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that intervention for unruptured brain AVMs at comprehensive stroke centers across the United States is safe.",2024 Dec 26,2024,Journal of neurointerventional surgery,17,e1,e1-e8,eng,True,10.1136/jnis-2023-020525;jnis-2023-020525;10.1136/jnis-2023-020525,Comparative Study;Journal Article;Multicenter Study,"Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/therapy/mortality;Male;Female;Adult;Middle Aged;Treatment Outcome;Retrospective Studies;*Registries;*Radiosurgery/methods;Embolization, Therapeutic/methods;Stroke/etiology/epidemiology;Microsurgery/methods;Young Adult;Aged",Arteriovenous Malformation;Intervention;Stroke
30948381,Morphologic Change of Flow-Related Aneurysms in Brain Arteriovenous Malformations after Stereotactic Radiosurgery.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The natural history of flow-related aneurysms after obliteration of brain arteriovenous malformations is poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the angioarchitecture and morphologic change in flow-related aneurysms after gamma knife surgery of brain arteriovenous malformations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During a 12-year period, 823 patients with brain arteriovenous malformations underwent gamma knife surgery at our institution with complete peritherapeutic angiographic evaluation. From this population, a series of 72 patients (8.8%) with 111 flow-related aneurysms were enrolled (1.5 aneurysms per patient). There were 43 men and 29 women; ages ranged from 18 to 72 years (mean, 43 years). The morphologic change of flow-related aneurysms was longitudinally evaluated before and after obliteration of brain arteriovenous malformations. After gamma knife surgery, angiographic follow-up varied from 26 to 130 months (mean, 58 months). RESULTS: All flow-related aneurysms were small (mean, 4.1 mm; range, 2-9 mm). There were 72 proximal flow-related aneurysms (mean size, 4.3 mm) and 39 distal flow-related aneurysms (mean size, 3.7 mm). Spontaneous thrombosis occurred more frequently in distal flow-related aneurysms than in proximal flow-related aneurysms (P < .001). Smaller flow-related aneurysms (<5 mm) tended to spontaneously occlude after obliteration of brain arteriovenous malformations (P = .036). Two patients had ruptures of proximal flow-related aneurysms at 27- and 54-month follow-ups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Spontaneous thrombosis occurred more frequently in distal flow-related aneurysms due to occlusion or normalization of distal feeders. Smaller flow-related aneurysms also tended to spontaneously thrombose after obliteration of brain arteriovenous malformations. The rate of flow-related aneurysm rupture in our series was similar to that of natural intradural aneurysms.",2019 Apr,2019,AJNR.

37162690,Application of diffusion tensor-based tractography in treatment of brain arteriovenous malformations: a systematic review.,"There is no systematic review investigating the utility of Diffusion tensor-based tractography findings for treating brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs). This systematic review aims to investigate the outcomes following bAVM treatment when tractography data is incorporated into treatment planning. PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Cochrane Library, were searched for published studies. Prospective or retrospective studies involving at least one patient with confirmed bAVM and available data on tractography and clinical outcomes were included. A total of 16 studies were eligible for this review, consisting of 298 patients. 48.2% of patients were female. The mean age of the patients was 27.5 years (range: 5-77). Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and microsurgical resection each were the treatment of choice in eight studies, respectively. Two-hundred forty-eight patients underwent SRS as the primary treatment, while microsurgery was used to resect the bAVMs in 50 patients. The corticospinal tract, optic pathway, and arcuate fasciculus were the most widely investigated white matter tracts. Tractography disruption and failure frequencies were 19.1% and 1.8%, respectively. The pooled proportions (95% CI) of obliteration rates were 88.78% (73.51-95.76) for microsurgery and 51.45% (13-17-88.10) following SRS. Treatment-related non-hemorrhagic complications rates occurred in 24.2% and 9.9% of patients who underwent microsurgical resection and SRS, respectively. Tractography findings can contribute to providing a more accurate dosimetry analysis of functional white matter tracts at risk prior to SRS and minimizing the surgical morbidity following microsurgical resection.",2023 May 10,2023,Neurosurgical review,46,1,115,eng,False,10.1007/s10143-023-02017-0;10.1007/s10143-023-02017-0;10.1007/s10143-023-02017-0,Journal Article;Review;Systematic Review,"Humans;Female;Child, Preschool;Child;Adolescent;Young Adult;Adult;Middle Aged;Aged;Male;Retrospective Studies;Prospective Studies;Brain;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/surgery;Diffusion Tensor Imaging;*Radiosurgery;Treatment Outcome",Diffusion tensor imaging;Intracranial arteriovenous malformation;Microsurgery;Morbidity;Radiosurgery;Systematic review
28890009,Impact of Onyx Embolization on Radiosurgical Management of Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformations: Treatment and Outcome.,"BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a well-established treatment modality for cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). The main limiting factor in the radiosurgical treatment of AVMs is the volume of the nidus, with high-grade lesions often requiring combined treatment to reduce the SRS target volume. To overcome this limitation, we have been using a combined treatment approach consisting of endovascular embolization with Onyx followed by SRS. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate our clinical experience for safety and feasibility of this multimodality treatment approach. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of all adult patients with cerebral AVMs who received SRS treatment to their AVM after endovascular embolization with Onyx between June 2007 and June 2014. RESULTS: Thirty-five consecutive patients were identified. The mean follow-up period was 52.4 ± 22.6 months (range 18-97 months). We confirmed 18 (51.4%) complete nidus closures at a median time of 49.5 months (range 6.5-81 months) from SRS. High-resolution Magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography was performed routinely in all patients until closure of the nidus. Digital subtraction angiography was performed to confirm complete obliteration in 5 of the patients (28%); 13 patients are either planned for digital subtraction angiography or have refused it. In 6 patients (17%) a significant flow reduction was noted after a mean of 32 ± 16 months. No significant improvement was observed in 9 patients (26%) during the follow-up period. Two patients were lost to follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The multimodality treatment of cerebral AVMs using embolization with Onyx followed by SRS is feasible and safe. The use of Onyx significantly reduced the SRS treatment target volume.",2017 Dec,2017,World neurosurgery,108,,656-661,eng,False,S1878-8750(17)31498-5;10.1016/j.wneu.2017.08.188;S1878-8750(17)31498-5;10.1016/j.wneu.2017.08.188,Journal Article,"Adult;Angiography, Digital Subtraction;Cerebral Angiography;*Embolization, Therapeutic/adverse effects;Feasibility Studies;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/*therapy;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Prospective Studies;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome",AVM;Arteriovenous malformations;Embolization;Onyx;Radiosurgery;SRS
21345616,Integration of three-dimensional rotational angiography in radiosurgical treatment planning of cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"PURPOSE: Accuracy in delineating the target volume is a major issue for successful stereotactic radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations. The aim of the present study was to describe a method to integrate three-dimensional (3D) rotational angiography (3DRA) into CyberKnife treatment planning and to investigate its potential advantages compared with computed tomography angiography (CTA) and magnetic resonance angiography. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 20 patients with a diagnosis of cerebral arteriovenous malformation were included in the present study. All patients underwent multislice computed tomography and 3D-volumetric CTA, 3DRA, and 3D magnetic resonance angiography. The contouring of the target and critical volumes was done separately using CTA and thereafter directly using 3DRA. The composite, conjoint, and disjoint volumes were measured. RESULTS: The use of CTA or 3DRA resulted in significant differences in the target and critical volumes. The target volume averaged 3.49 ± 3.01 mL measured using CTA and 3.26 ± 2.93 mL measured using 3DRA, for a difference of 8% (p < .05). The conjoint and disjoint volume analysis showed an 88% volume overlap. The qualitative evaluation showed that the excess volume obtained using CTA was mostly tissue surrounding the nidus and venous structures. The mean contoured venous volume was 0.67 mL measured using CTA and 0.88 mL (range, 0.1-2.7) measured using 3DRA (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: 3DRA is a volumetric angiographic study that can be integrated into computer-based treatment planning. Although whether 3DRA provides superior accuracy has not yet been proved, its high spatial resolution is attractive and offers a superior 3D view. This allows a better 3D understanding of the target volume and distribution of the radiation doses within the volume. Additional technical efforts to improve the temporal resolution and the development of software tools aimed at improving the performance of 3D contouring are warranted.",2011 Nov 1,2011,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",81,3,e29-37,eng,False,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2010.12.024;S0360-3016(11)00012-5;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2010.12.024,Comparative Study;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Algorithms;Cerebral Angiography/*methods;Female;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional/*methods;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Italy;Magnetic Resonance Angiography/methods;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/*methods;Surgery, Computer-Assisted/*methods;Tomography, X-Ray Computed/methods;Young Adult",
24372542,Outcomes following single-session radiosurgery for high-grade intracranial arteriovenous malformations.,"INTRODUCTION: The management of Spetzler-Martin Grade-IV and -V arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is controversial due to their uncertain natural history, the high rate of morbidity and mortality associated with microsurgical resection, and the relatively low rate of successful obliteration from less invasive approaches such as radiosurgery and embolization. We present our radiosurgical results for high-grade AVMs. METHODS: We identified all patients with Spetzler-Martin Grade-IV and -V AVMs treated with single-session radiosurgery at the University of Virginia between 1989 and 2009. Patients with less than 2 years of follow-up without obliteration were excluded. This yielded 110 patients with a median age 27.6 years. The median AVM volume was 5.7 cc and prescription dose was 19 Gy. The median radiographic and clinical follow-up intervals were 88 and 97 months, respectively. RESULTS: Complete AVM obliteration was identified on MRI only in 11 patients (10%) and confirmed by DSA in 38 patients (34%) for a cumulative obliteration rate of 44%. The actuarial rates of obliteration at 3 and 5 years were 10% and 23%, respectively. The mean and median times to obliteration were 60 months and 43 months, respectively. Significant independent predictors of obliteration were no pre-radiosurgery embolization (P = 0.008), superficial location (P = 0.001), and higher prescription dose (P = 0.028). The annual rate of post-radiosurgery hemorrhage was 3.0%, and symptomatic RIC was observed in 12% of patients. Unruptured AVMs were more likely to have RIC (P = 0.005). The rates of temporary and permanent post-radiosurgery clinical deterioration were 9% and 10%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Single-session radiosurgery is an acceptable treatment option for select patients harboring high-grade AVMs for which microsurgery or conservative management are associated with an unacceptably high risk of adverse outcomes.",2014 Oct,2014,British journal of neurosurgery,28,5,666-74,eng,True,10.3109/02688697.2013.872227;10.3109/02688697.2013.872227,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Cerebral Angiography/methods;Child;Child, Preschool;Embolization, Therapeutic/methods;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;*Microsurgery/methods;Middle Aged;*Radiosurgery/methods;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",high Spetzler–Martin grade;intracranial arteriovenous malformation;radiosurgery;stroke;vascular malformations
23867301,Radiosurgery for primary motor and sensory cortex arteriovenous malformations: outcomes and the effect of eloquent location.,"BACKGROUND: Eloquent intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) located in the primary motor or somatosensory cortex (PMSC) carry a high risk of microsurgical morbidity. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the outcomes of radiosurgery on PMSC AVMs and compare them with radiosurgery outcomes in a matched cohort of noneloquent lobar AVMs. METHODS: Between 1989 and 2009, 134 patients with PMSC AVMs underwent Gamma Knife radiosurgery with a median radiographic and clinical follow-up of 64 and 80 months, respectively. Seizure (40.3%) and hemorrhage (28.4%) were the most common presenting symptoms. Pre-radiosurgery embolization was performed in 33.6% of AVMs. Median AVM volume was 4.1 mL (range, 0.1-22.6 mL), and prescription dose was 20 Gy (range, 7-30 Gy). Cox regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with obliteration. RESULTS: The overall obliteration rate, including magnetic resonance imaging and angiography, after radiosurgery was 63%. Obliteration was achieved in 80% of AVMs with a volume less than 3 mL compared with 55% for AVMs larger than 3 mL. No previous embolization (P = .002) and a single draining vein (P = .001) were independent predictors of obliteration on multivariate analysis. The annual post-radiosurgery hemorrhage risk was 2.5%. Radiosurgery-related morbidity was temporary and permanent in 14% and 6% of patients, respectively. Comparing PMSC AVMs with matched noneloquent lobar AVMs, the obliteration rates and clinical outcomes after radiosurgery were not statistically different. CONCLUSION: For patients harboring PMSC AVMs, radiosurgery offers a reasonable chance of obliteration with a relatively low complication rate.

27035170,Clinical characteristics of arteriovenous malformations in the cerebellopontine angle cistern.,"OBJECTIVE Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in the cerebellopontine angle cistern (CPAC) are specific lesions that can cause neurovascular compression syndromes as well as intracranial hemorrhage. Although case reports describing the CPAC AVMs, especially those presenting with trigeminal neuralgia (TN), have been accumulating by degrees, the pathophysiology of CPAC AVMs remains obscure. The authors' purpose in the present study was to evaluate the clinical and radiographic features of CPAC AVMs as well as the treatment options. METHODS This study defined a CPAC AVM as a small AVM predominantly located in the CPAC with minimal extension into the pial surface of the brainstem and closely associated with cranial nerves. All patients with CPAC AVMs treated in the authors' affiliated hospitals over a 16-year period were retrospectively identified. Clinical charts, imaging studies, and treatment options were evaluated. RESULTS Ten patients (6 men and 4 women), ranging in age from 56 to 77 years (mean 65.6 years), were diagnosed with CPAC AVMs according to the authors' definition. Six patients presented with hemorrhage, 3 with TN, and the remaining patient developed a hemorrhage subsequent to TN. Seven AVMs were associated with the trigeminal nerve (Group V), and 3 with the facial-vestibulocochlear nerve complex (Group VII-VIII). All patients in Group VII-VIII presented with the hemorrhage instead of hemifacial spasm. Regarding angioarchitecture, the intrinsic pontine arteries provided the blood supply for all CPAC AVMs in Group V. In addition, 5 of 7 AVMs with hemorrhagic episodes accompanied flow-related aneurysms, although no aneurysm was detected in patients with TN alone. With respect to treatment, all patients with hemorrhagic presentation underwent Gamma Knife surgery (GKS), resulting in favorable outcomes except for 1 patient who experienced rebleeding after GKS, which was caused by the repeated rupture of a feeder aneurysm. The AVMs causing TN were managed with surgery, GKS, or a combination, according to the nidus-nerve relationship. All patients eventually obtained pain relief. CONCLUSIONS Clinical symptoms caused by CPAC AVMs occur at an older age compared with AVMs in other locations; CPAC AVMs also have distinctive angioarchitectures according to their location in the CPAC. Although GKS is likely to be an effective treatment option for the CPAC AVMs with hemorrhagic presentations, it seems ideal to obliterate the flow-related aneurysms before performing GKS, although this is frequently challenging. For CPAC AVMs with TN, it is important to evaluate the nidus-nerve relationship before treatment, and GKS is especially useful for patients who do not require urgent pain relief.",2017 Jan,2017,Journal of neurosurgery,126,1,60-68,eng,False,10.3171/2015.12.JNS152190;10.3171/2015.12.JNS152190,Comment;Journal Article,Aged;Cerebellopontine Angle;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;*Trigeminal Neuralgia,AICA = anterior inferior cerebellar artery;AVM = arteriovenous malformation;BVR = basal vein of Rosenthal;CISS = constructive interference in steady state;CPAC = cerebellopontine angle cistern;DSA = digital subtraction angiography;GKS = Gamma Knife surgery;Gamma Knife surgery;ICH = intracerebral hemorrhage;IPA = intrinsic pontine artery;IPS = inferior petrosal sinus;MRA = MR angiography;SAH = subarachnoid hemorrhage;SCA = superior cerebellar artery;SPS = superior petrosal sinus;TN = trigeminal neuralgia;TOF = time of flight;arteriovenous malformation;cerebellopontine angle;mRS = modified Rankin Scale;vascular disorders
12015835,Long-term results after stereotactic radiosurgery for patients with cavernous malformations.,"OBJECTIVE: Stereotactic radiosurgery has been used for patients with high-risk cavernous malformations of the brain. We performed radiosurgery for patients with symptomatic, imaging-confirmed hemorrhages for which resection was believed to be associated with high risk. This study examines the long-term hemorrhage rate after radiosurgery. METHODS: We reviewed data obtained before and after gamma knife radiosurgery on 82 patients treated between 1987 and 2000. Most patients had multiple hemorrhages from brainstem or diencephalic cavernous malformations. Follow-up data were examined to identify hemorrhages, and an overall hemorrhage rate was calculated. RESULTS: Observation before treatment averaged 4.33 years (range, 0.17-18 yr) for a total of 354 patient-years. During this period, 202 hemorrhages were observed, for an annual hemorrhage rate of 33.9%, excluding the first hemorrhage. Temporal clustering of hemorrhages was not significant. After radiosurgery, patient follow-up averaged 5 years (range, 0.42-12.08 yr), for a total of 401 patient-years. During this period, 19 hemorrhages were identified, 17 in the first 2 years posttreatment and 2 after 2 years. The annual hemorrhage rate was 12.3% per year for the first 2 years after radiosurgery, followed by 0.76% per year from Years 2 to 12. Eleven patients had new neurological symptoms without hemorrhage after radiosurgery (13.4%). The symptoms were minor in six of these patients and temporary in five. CONCLUSION: Radiosurgery confers a reduction in the risk of hemorrhage for high-risk cavernous malformations. Risk reduction, although in evidence during initial follow-up, is most pronounced after 2 years. Given the difficulty of identifying high-risk patients, treatment after one major hemorrhage should be considered in selected younger patients. Such a strategy warrants further investigation.",2002 Jun,2002,Neurosurgery,50,6,1190-7; discussion 1197-8,eng,False,10.1097/00006123-200206000-00003,Journal Article,"Cerebral Hemorrhage/epidemiology/etiology;Hemangioma, Cavernous/complications/*surgery;Humans;Incidence;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/diagnosis/*surgery;Longitudinal Studies;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Postoperative Complications/epidemiology;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects;*Stereotaxic Techniques",
28126751,Application of Time-Resolved 3D Digital Subtraction Angiography to Plan Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformation Radiosurgery.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Time-resolved 3D-DSA (4D-DSA) enables viewing vasculature from any desired angle and time frame. We investigated whether these advantages may facilitate treatment planning and the feasibility of using 4D-DSA as a single imaging technique in AVM/dural arteriovenous fistula radiosurgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients (8 dural arteriovenous fistulas and 12 AVMs; 13 men and 7 women; mean age, 45 years; range, 18-64 years) who were scheduled for gamma knife radiosurgery were recruited (November 2014 to October 2015). An optimal volume of reconstructed time-resolved 3D volumes that defines the AVM nidus/dural arteriovenous fistula was sliced into 2D-CT-like images. The original radiosurgery treatment plan was overlaid retrospectively. The registration errors of stereotactic 4D-DSA were compared with those of integrated stereotactic imaging. AVM/dural arteriovenous fistula volumes were contoured, and disjoint and conjoint components were identified. The Wilcoxon signed rank test and the Wilcoxon rank sum test were adopted to evaluate registration errors and contoured volumes of stereotactic 4D-DSA and integration of stereotactic MR imaging and stereotactic 2D-DSA. RESULTS: Sixteen of 20 patients were successfully registered in Advanced Leksell GammaPlan Program. The registration error of stereotactic 4D-DSA was smaller than that of integrated stereotactic imaging (P = .0009). The contoured AVM volume of 4D-DSA was smaller than that contoured on the integration of MR imaging and 2D-DSA, while major inconsistencies existed in cases of dural arteriovenous fistula (P = .042 and 0.039, respectively, for measurements conducted by 2 authors). CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of stereotactic 4D-DSA data for gamma knife radiosurgery for brain AVM/dural arteriovenous fistula is feasible. The ability of 4D-DSA to demonstrate vascular morphology and hemodynamics in 4 dimensions potentially reduces the target volumes of irradiation in vascular radiosurgery.",2017 Apr,2017,AJNR.

34483452,Multimodality Management in bAVM Surgery - Recent Experience from International Cerebrovascular Fellowship.,"BACKGROUND: Arteriovenous malformation (bAVM) presents maldevelopment of the brain's vessels with a direct connection between cerebral arteries and veins. By current data, patients from Spetzler Ponce A (SP) are found to benefit from the treatment. Considering the outcome, most of SP C and some of the SP B are the most debatable. OBJECTIVE: Arteriovenous malformation presents maldevelopment of the brain's vessels with a consequent direct connection between cerebral arteries and veins. The annual risk of hemorrhage in adults is reported for 2-3 %. They usually present with unilateral headaches seizures and intracranial hemorrhage. By current data, patients from Spetzler Ponce A (SP) are found to benefit from the treatment. Considering the outcome, most of SP C and some of the SP B are the most debatable. METHODS: The study included a cohort of bAVM patients referred to Fujita Health University Bantane Hotokukai Hospital, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan where the main author (AA) has completed an international cerebrovascular fellowship under the mentorship of Professor Yoko Kato. Japanese Stroke Guidelines (JSG) were used for the treatment decision. Patients were graded according to the Spetzler Ponce (SP) system. Considering American Heart Association criteria (AHA), embolization was used as a part of multimodal treatment. Intraoperative microscopic video tools included Indocyanine green ICG, FLOW 800 and dual image video angiography DIVA. Clinical outcomes were measured using Modified Ranking Score (mRs). RESULTS: A total of eleven patients with brain bAVM were studied with a median age of 32 years [IQR = 22-52]. There were ten patients presented with supratentorial and a single patient with infratentorial AVM. Patients were graded according to the Spetzler Ponce (SP) system. There were eight patients in SP A (72,7%), one in group B (9 %) while the rest of them were in C (18 %). Two patients had associated aneurysms that required treatment. The median size of the AVM nidus was 3,50 cm [IQR= 2-5]. Deep venous drainage was found in six patients while three were located in eloquent zones. Clinical outcomes were considered good by mRs <2 in eight patients, seven from the surgically treated group (72,7 % respectively). Surgery median length time was 427, 5 minutes; [IQR =320 - 463] with complete AVM resection in all patients and no mortality recorded in this cohort with the median follow up of 39,5 months [IQR = 19-59]. CONCLUSION: Ideal management of bAVM is still controversial. Those complex vascular lesions require multimodal treatment in a majority of cases in highly specialized centers. In SP A patients, surgery provides the best results with a positive outcome and a small number of complications. With the improvement of endovascular feeder occlusion SP B patients become prone to a more positive outcome. Nowadays, intraoperative microscopic tools such as FLOW 800, ICG and DIVA are irreplaceable while improving safety to deal with bAVM. For SP C patients, a combination of endovascular and stereotactic radiosurgery was found to be a good option in the present time.",2021 Jun,2021,"Medical archives (Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina)",75,3,209-215,eng,False,10.5455/medarh.2021.75.209-215;10.5455/medarh.2021.75.209-215,Journal Article,Adult;Cohort Studies;Fellowships and Scholarships;Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations;Middle Aged;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult,DIVA;FLOW 800;ICG;Spetzler Martin (SM);Spetzler Ponce (SP);bAVM

A 49-year-old male underwent transarterial embolization and surgical excision of a cerebral AVM presenting with cerebral hemorrhage in the left temporal lobe. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) was done after 12 months. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 14 months after SRS showed a small-enhancing lesion close to the left lateral ventricle and marked white matter edema. At that time a diagnosis of radiation-induced necrosis was made and steroids administered. At 43 months after SRS, MRI showed a small-enhancing mass close to the lateral ventricle with a hematoma cavity. Surgical excision was performed and histological examination revealed that the capsule consisted of an outer collagenous layer and an inner granulated layer with deposits of hemosiderin, which was compatible with CEIH.

28495425,Volume-staged stereotactic radiosurgery for large intracranial arteriovenous malformations.,"Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is an effective treatment option for intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVM). However, the treatment of large AVMs (nidus volume ≥12cm(3)) with single-session SRS alone yields generally poor outcomes. Volume-staged SRS (VS-SRS) is a therapeutic strategy for large AVMs which seeks to avoid the disadvantages of single-session SRS, but reports regarding its efficacy remain limited. The aim of this retrospective cohort study is to assess the outcomes of VS-SRS for large AVMs. We identified all AVM patients who underwent VS-SRS at our institution from 2000 to 2015 with ≥12months follow-up. Baseline and outcomes data were analyzed. A total of 12 patients were selected for the study cohort, with a median age of 30years. The median maximum AVM diameter and nidus volume were 4.3cm and 13.6cm(3), respectively. The Spetzler-Martin grade was III and IV each in six AVMs (50%). All patients underwent VS-SRS in two stages, and the median margin dose was 17Gy for both VS-SRS procedures. The median time interval between the two procedures was three months. After a median radiologic follow-up duration of 39months, the median degree of AVM volume reduction (evaluable in nine patients) was 87% (range 12-99%). The rates of radiologically evident, symptomatic, and permanent radiation-induced changes were 58%, 25%, and 8%, respectively. There were no cases of post-SRS hemorrhage. VS-SRS substantially reduces the size of large AVMs. A potential role for VS-SRS may be to facilitate subsequent definitive intervention to obliterate a shrunken, residual nidus.",2017 Sep,2017,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society,43,,202-207,eng,False,S0967-5868(16)30318-6;10.1016/j.jocn.2017.04.020;S0967-5868(16)30318-6;10.1016/j.jocn.2017.04.020,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Arteriovenous Fistula/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Child;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;*Outcome Assessment, Health Care;Radiosurgery/*methods;Retrospective Studies;Young Adult",Gamma Knife;Intracranial arteriovenous malformations;Intracranial hemorrhages;Radiosurgery;Stroke;Vascular malformations
24268105,"Medical management with or without interventional therapy for unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations (ARUBA): a multicentre, non-blinded, randomised trial.","BACKGROUND: The clinical benefit of preventive eradication of unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations remains uncertain. A Randomised trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous malformations (ARUBA) aims to compare the risk of death and symptomatic stroke in patients with an unruptured brain arteriovenous malformation who are allocated to either medical management alone or medical management with interventional therapy. METHODS: Adult patients (≥18 years) with an unruptured brain arteriovenous malformation were enrolled into this trial at 39 clinical sites in nine countries. Patients were randomised (by web-based system, in a 1:1 ratio, with random permuted block design [block size 2, 4, or 6], stratified by clinical site) to medical management with interventional therapy (ie, neurosurgery, embolisation, or stereotactic radiotherapy, alone or in combination) or medical management alone (ie, pharmacological therapy for neurological symptoms as needed). Patients, clinicians, and investigators are aware of treatment assignment. The primary outcome is time to the composite endpoint of death or symptomatic stroke; the primary analysis is by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00389181. FINDINGS: Randomisation was started on April 4, 2007, and was stopped on April 15, 2013, when a data and safety monitoring board appointed by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke of the National Institutes of Health recommended halting randomisation because of superiority of the medical management group (log-rank Z statistic of 4·10, exceeding the prespecified stopping boundary value of 2·87). At this point, outcome data were available for 223 patients (mean follow-up 33·3 months [SD 19·7]), 114 assigned to interventional therapy and 109 to medical management. The primary endpoint had been reached by 11 (10·1%) patients in the medical management group compared with 35 (30·7%) in the interventional therapy group. The risk of death or stroke was significantly lower in the medical management group than in the interventional therapy group (hazard ratio 0·27, 95% CI 0·14-0·54). No harms were identified, other than a higher number of strokes (45 vs 12, p<0·0001) and neurological deficits unrelated to stroke (14 vs 1, p=0·0008) in patients allocated to interventional therapy compared with medical management. INTERPRETATION: The ARUBA trial showed that medical management alone is superior to medical management with interventional therapy for the prevention of death or stroke in patients with unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations followed up for 33 months. The trial is continuing its observational phase to establish whether the disparities will persist over an additional 5 years of follow-up.

20299719,Vascular structure and binomial statistics for response modeling in radiosurgery of cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"Radiation treatment of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) has a slow and progressive vaso-occlusive effect. Some studies suggested the possible role of vascular structure in this process. A detailed biomathematical model has been used, where the morphological, biophysical and hemodynamic characteristics of intracranial AVM vessels are faithfully reproduced. The effect of radiation on plexiform and fistulous AVM nidus vessels was simulated using this theoretical model. The similarities between vascular and electrical networks were used to construct this biomathematical AVM model and provide an accurate rendering of transnidal and intranidal hemodynamics. The response of different vessels to radiation and their obliteration probability as a function of different angiostructures were simulated and total obliteration was defined as the probability of obliteration of all possible vascular pathways. The dose response of the whole AVM is observed to depend on the vascular structure of the intra-nidus AVM. Furthermore, a plexiform AVM appears to be more prone to obliteration compared with an AVM of the same size but having more arteriovenous fistulas. Finally, a binomial model was introduced, which considers the number of crucial vessels and is able to predict the dose response behavior of AVMs with a complex vascular structure.",2010 Apr 7,2010,Physics in medicine and biology,55,7,2057-67,eng,False,10.1088/0031-9155/55/7/017;S0031-9155(10)33691-8;10.1088/0031-9155/55/7/017,Journal Article,"Binomial Distribution;Cerebral Arteries/pathology/*physiopathology/*surgery;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/pathology/*physiopathology/*surgery;Models, Anatomic;*Models, Biological;Models, Statistical;Radiosurgery/*methods;Surgery, Computer-Assisted/*methods",
15113464,Study of magnetic resonance imaging-based arteriovenous malformation delineation without conventional angiography.,"OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to assess the feasibility of arteriovenous malformation (AVM) delineation for gamma knife radiosurgery without conventional angiography and to correlate factors that may affect AVM delineation. METHODS: A series of 57 consecutive patients with AVMs treated with gamma knife radiosurgery from August 1994 to December 2000 were reviewed. All patients in the study had undergone pretreatment angiography. The mean AVM volume was 2.8 cm(3), with a median of 2.0 cm(3) (range, 0.04-22 cm(3)). All AVMs were delineated on the original frame-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans by a vascular neurosurgeon without the assistance of angiography and then compared with the actual AVM delineation on the basis of previously performed angiography and MRI. Univariate correlation analysis was used to determine the relationship of AVM coverage, size, diffuseness, previous embolization, and hemorrhage parameters. RESULTS: The study volume or MRI-based volume alone coincided with the actual treatment volume by a mean of 58% for diffuse and 87% for nondiffuse AVMs (P = 0.0005). At AVM volume greater than 2 cm(3), the median percentage of coinciding volume was 63% for embolized AVMs and 82% for nonembolized AVMs (P = 0.0315). Conversely, the study volume overestimated the actual treatment volume by a mean of 57% for AVMs larger than 2 cm(3) versus 25% for AVMs smaller than 2 cm(3) (P = 0.0012). In general, the percentage of the coinciding volume was inversely related to that of the excess volume, whereas both the study volume and the coinciding volume were proportionate to AVM volume at treatment. CONCLUSION: MRI-based AVM delineation without conventional angiography may be feasible only for selected patients, such as those with nondiffuse and large nonembolized AVMs.",2004 May,2004,Neurosurgery,54,5,1104-; discussion 1108-10,eng,False,10.1227/01.neu.0000119327.53881.05,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Cerebral Angiography;Child;Child, Preschool;Feasibility Studies;Female;Humans;Infant;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/*pathology/*surgery;*Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/*methods;Retrospective Studies;Severity of Illness Index;Treatment Outcome",

27058199,Comparative analysis of arteriovenous malformation grading scales in predicting outcomes after stereotactic radiosurgery.,"OBJECTIVE Successful stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for the treatment of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) results in nidus obliteration without new neurological deficits related to either intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) or radiation-induced complications (RICs). In this study the authors compared 5 AVM grading scales (Spetzler-Martin grading scale, radiosurgery-based AVM score [RBAS], Heidelberg score, Virginia Radiosurgery AVM Scale [VRAS], and proton radiosurgery AVM scale [PRAS]) at predicting outcomes after SRS. METHODS The study group consisted of 381 patients with sporadic AVMs who underwent Gamma Knife SRS between January 1990 and December 2009; none of the patients underwent prior radiation therapy. The primary end point was AVM obliteration without a decline in modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score (excellent outcome). Comparison of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and accuracy was performed between the AVM grading scales and the best linear regression model (generalized linear model, elastic net [GLMnet]). RESULTS The median radiological follow-up after initial SRS was 77 months; the median clinical follow-up was 93 months. AVM obliteration was documented in 297 patients (78.0%). Obliteration was 59% at 4 years and 85% at 8 years. Fifty-five patients (14.4%) had a decline in mRS score secondary to RICs (n = 29, 7.6%) or ICH (n = 26, 6.8%). The mRS score declined by 10% at 4 years and 15% at 8 years. Overall, 274 patients (71.9%) had excellent outcomes. There was no difference between the AUC for the GLMnet (0.69 [95% CI 0.64-0.75]), RBAS (0.68 [95% CI 0.62-0.74]), or PRAS (0.69 [95% CI 0.62-0.74]). Pairwise comparison for accuracy showed no difference between the GLMnet and the RBAS (p = 0.08) or PRAS (p = 0.16), but it did show a significant difference between the GLMnet and the Spetzler-Martin grading system (p < 0.001), Heidelberg score (p < 0.001), and the VRAS (p < 0.001). The RBAS and the PRAS were more accurate when compared with the Spetzler-Martin grading scale (p = 0.03 and p = 0.01), Heidelberg score (p = 0.02 and p = 0.02), and VRAS (p = 0.03 and p = 0.02).

15537200,Novalis Shaped Beam Radiosurgery of arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECT: The authors studied outcomes and complications in patients who harbored arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and underwent stereotactic radiosurgery involving the Novalis shaped beam unit. METHODS: Between January 1998 and January 2002, 83 patients were treated with radiosurgery at University of California, Los Angeles. The mean patient age was 37.8 years. Forty-four patients completed follow up. There were 24 women. Sixteen patients underwent repeated radiosurgery. Embolization was performed in 13 patients and radiosurgery alone in 31. The mean follow-up period after embolization was 54.4+/-21.9 months and 37.4+/-14.6 months for radiosurgery alone. The mean peripheral dose was 15 Gy (range 12-18 Gy). The mean preradiosurgery lesion volume was 9.7+/-11.9 ml for radiosurgery alone and 16.2+/-11.3 ml for embolization. The AVMs in 13 patients (29.8%) were Spetzler-Martin Grade II, 12 (27.5%) were Grade III, eight (18.2%) Grade IV, and five (11.3%) were Grade V and VI each. Spetzler-Martin grade, volume, and peripheral dose were analyzed in consideration to outcome. A positive trend (p = 0.086) was observed between Spetzler-Martin grade and obliteration rate. Volume per se did not predict obliteration (p = 0.48). A peripheral dose of 18 Gy was shown to be the most important predictor for occlusion (p = 0.007). The overall obliteration rate was 52.5%. A transient complication was noticed in one case (2.3%) and but no permanent deficits due to radiosurgery have been detected so far. Three patients (6.8%) bled after radiosurgery. CONCLUSIONS: The range of the prescribed peripheral dose was narrow. An association between the mean peripheral dose of 15 Gy, high conformality, and homogeneous dose distribution permitted no permanent complications. Volume per se did not correlate with outcome. The next step will be to increase the peripheral dose shaping the beam and to achieve higher obliteration rates without increasing complications.",2004 Nov,2004,Journal of neurosurgery,101 Suppl 3,,425-34,eng,True,,Evaluation Study;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Child;Dose Fractionation, Radiation;Embolization, Therapeutic;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/*surgery/therapy;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Postoperative Period;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects;Radiotherapy Dosage;*Radiotherapy, Conformal/adverse effects;Reoperation;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome",

The QOL questionnaire was developed as a retrospective screening tool to estimate the present QOL and the patient's self-rated relative changes (trend values) in QOL after radiosurgery. These results were correlated to one another using the Engel seizure frequency scoring system. RESULTS: The follow-up periods ranged from 48.0 to 151.0 months (mean, 92.5). The mean trend values and mean QOL scores in patients with seizure freedom or AVM obliteration were significantly greater than in patients without these outcomes (all P values < 0.05). Good radiosurgical outcomes were associated with attaining employment (all P values < 0.05). However, differences in employment status were not significant (P = 0.186) despite a higher proportion of patients who described their workplace activity as improved compared with their pre-radiosurgical activity at the last follow-up evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: Radiosurgery may improve QOL and employment status in AVM patients, especially patients who experience seizure freedom or AVM obliteration.",2012 Jul,2012,European journal of neurology,19,7,984-91,eng,False,10.1111/j.1468-1331.2012.03664.x;10.1111/j.1468-1331.2012.03664.x,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adult;Diagnosis, Differential;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/epidemiology/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;*Quality of Life/psychology;*Radiosurgery/psychology;Seizures/diagnosis/epidemiology/*surgery;Surveys and Questionnaires;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",
25658780,Stereotactic radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations after Onyx embolization: a case-control study.,"OBJECT: Onyx, an ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer mixed in a dimethyl sulfoxide solvent, is currently one of the most widely used liquid materials for embolization of intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). The goal of this study was to define the risks and benefits of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for patients who have previously undergone partial AVM embolization with Onyx. METHODS: Among a consecutive series of 199 patients who underwent SRS between January 2007 and December 2012 at the University of Virginia, 25 patients had Onyx embolization prior to SRS (the embolization group). To analyze the obliteration rates and complications, 50 patients who underwent SRS without prior embolization (the no-embolization group) were matched by propensity score method. The matched variables included age, sex, nidus volume before SRS, margin dose, Spetzler-Martin grade, Virginia Radiosurgery AVM Scale score, and median imaging follow-up period. RESULTS: After Onyx embolization, 18 AVMs were reduced in size. Total obliteration was achieved in 6 cases (24%) at a median of 27.5 months after SRS. In the no-embolization group, total obliteration was achieved in 20 patients (40%) at a median of 22.4 months after SRS. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated obliteration rates of 17.7% and 34.1% in the embolization group at 2 and 4 years, respectively. In the no-embolization group, the corresponding obliteration rates were 27.0% and 55.9%. The between-groups difference in obliteration rates after SRS did not achieve statistical significance. The difference in complications, including adverse radiation effects, hemorrhage episodes, seizure control, and patient mortality also did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Onyx embolization can effectively reduce the size of many AVMs. This case-control study did not show any statistically significant difference in the rates of embolization or complications after SRS in patients who had previously undergone Onyx embolization and those who had not.",2015 Jul,2015,Journal of neurosurgery,123,1,126-35,eng,True,10.3171/2014.12.JNS141437;10.3171/2014.12.JNS141437,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Case-Control Studies;Child;Combined Modality Therapy;Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*therapeutic use;Drug Combinations;Embolization, Therapeutic/*methods;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/pathology/*therapy;Kaplan-Meier Estimate;Logistic Models;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Polyvinyls/*therapeutic use;Radiosurgery/*methods;Tantalum/*therapeutic use;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",ARE = adverse radiation effect;AVM = arteriovenous malformation;DSA = digital subtraction angiography;EVOH = ethylene-vinyl alcohol;GKS = Gamma Knife surgery;Gamma Knife;LINAC = linear accelerator;MRA = MR angiography;Onyx;PVA = polyvinyl alcohol;RBAS = radiosurgery-based AVM score;SRS = stereotactic radiosurgery;arteriovenous malformation;embolization;nBCA = n-butyl-2-cyanacrylate;obliteration;stereotactic radiosurgery;vascular disorders
28614989,A challenging entity of endovascular embolization with ONYX for brainstem arteriovenous malformation: Experience from 13 cases.,"Objective Brainstem arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are rare lesions with a high risk of intracranial hemorrhage and are challenging to treat. We present our experience of endovascular embolization with Onyx in these aggressive lesions. Materials and methods Between 2007 and 2016, 13 patients with brainstem AVMs were embolized with Onyx at our center. Twelve patients presented with intracranial hemorrhage and one with headache. Retrospective examinations of patient demographics, clinical presentation, angiographic features, treatment modalities, postoperative complications and outcomes were carried out. Results The AVMs were in the midbrain in 10 patients (one anterior and nine posterior or dorsal), in the posterior pons in two and pontomedullary in one. Complete occlusion was achieved in three patients. Gamma knife radiosurgery was performed in six patients who were near-completely or partially embolized. Postoperative complications, including five cases of ischemia and one case of hemorrhage, resulted in four cases of neurological deterioration and two deaths. Clinical follow-up was obtained in 10 patients at a mean period of 45.2 months (range 3 to 93 months). During the follow-up, good clinical outcomes were observed in seven patients with posterior or dorsal midbrain AVMs, and one patient with a posterior pons AVM that was partially occluded died of intracranial hemorrhage.

10764252,Angiographic long-term follow-up data for arteriovenous malformations previously proven to be obliterated after gamma knife radiosurgery.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether angiograms obtained 2 years after radiosurgery, proving total arteriovenous malformation (AVM) occlusion, represent the final state of treated AVMs and adjacent normal vessels. METHODS: Angiograms were obtained for 48 patients 5 to 24 years after gamma knife radiosurgery and 4 to 17 years after the AVMs had been proven to be totally occluded after the treatment; changes in normal vessels and signs of recanalization were recorded. Ten of the patients developed clinical symptoms attributable to the AVMs or the treatment after having been declared cured, whereas the other patients did not exhibit symptoms. RESULTS: There was evidence of AVM nidi at the sites of previously occluded AVMs for two patients and of nidi adjacent to those sites for another two patients. Three of the four recurrent AVMs were associated with hemorrhaging. All patients who experienced hemorrhaging from previously occluded AVMs were < or = 14 years of age at the time of gamma knife radiosurgery. There were signs of segmental narrowing in normal vessels that had been irradiated with high doses (nine patients) or a low dose (one patient). The segmental narrowing decreased with time for four of these patients, was unchanged for four, and increased for two. These vascular changes did not produce clinical symptoms in any of the patients. CONCLUSION: There is a small possibility that AVMs may reappear after having been totally occluded after radiosurgery, especially in pediatric patients. Segmental narrowing in normal arteries after radiosurgery is a benign condition that rarely progresses and does not produce clinical symptoms.",2000 Apr,2000,Neurosurgery,46,4,803-8; discussion 809-10,eng,False,10.1097/00006123-200004000-00006,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;*Cerebral Angiography;Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology;Child;Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/*diagnostic;Longitudinal Studies;Male;Middle Aged;*Radiosurgery/*methods;Recurrence;Reoperation;Tomography, X-Ray Computed",
39023594,Comparison of imaging modalities for the accurate delineation of arteriovenous malformations (AVM) and evaluation of setup accuracy with reference to non-invasive LINAC-based stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).,"AIMS: To compare the accuracy of nidus delineation using magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) to digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and to evaluate setup accuracy of non-invasive frame SRS treatments. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A prospective observational study of 16 patients who underwent non-invasive frame LINAC-based SRS for brain AVMs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The nidus was separately delineated using DSA and MRA after co-registration onto CT simulation images and compared with respect to their volume and maximum diameters. During treatment, the setup errors observed in x-, y-, and z-directions were recorded. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Paired t-test (to compare volume and maximum diameter). Wilcoxon signed-rank test (for setup accuracy). RESULTS: The mean volume of nidus contoured in MRA was 4.16 cc compared to 3.11 cc in DSA (P 0.297). The mean maximum diameters using MRA and DSA, respectively, in antro-posterior, cranio- caudal, and transverse diameters were 21.97 cc vs. 19.46 cc (P 0.2380), 6.59 cc vs. 9.63 cc (P 0.161), and 18.87 cc vs. 16.81 cc (P 0.178). But these modalities can potentially misinterpret the nidus volume, warranting caution for use of either modality alone. The mean translational shift observed in the x-, y-, and z-directions were 0.06 mm, 0.13 mm, and 0.13 mm, respectively, when couch was brought to neutral position after clockwise couch rotation and 0.07, 0, and 0, respectively, after counterclockwise couch rotation. CONCLUSION: This study could not demonstrate any statistically significant differences in nidus delineation between MRA and DSA.

17327788,Embolization before radiosurgery reduces the obliteration rate of arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the arteriovenous malformation (AVM) obliteration rate and the clinical outcome after radiosurgery in patients with and without previous embolization. METHODS: Of 244 patients who underwent linear accelerator radiosurgery for AVMs at the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre between 1989 and 2000, 61 patients had embolization before radiosurgery and complete follow-up for at least 3 years. For 47 of these 61 patients (Group A, embolization plus radiosurgery), we were able to find 47 matching patients without previous embolization (Group B, radiosurgery alone). This group of matching patients had the same AVM volume (after embolization in Group A), location, and marginal dose. The radiosurgery-based AVM score and the obliteration prediction index were calculated. RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 44 months. Nidus obliteration was achieved in 22 patients in Group A (47%) and 33 patients in Group B (70%, P = 0.036). Permanent deficit related to hemorrhage or radiation occurred in three patients (6%) in Group A and three patients (6%) in Group B. During the first 3 years after radiosurgery, two patients (4%) in Group A experienced hemorrhage; in Group B, five patients (11%) experienced hemorrhage (P = 0.2). In Group B, two patients (4%) died and two patients (4%) had their AVM surgically removed. Both deaths were related to hemorrhage during the latency period. The excellent outcome (obliteration plus no deficit) in Group A was 47% compared with 64% in Group B (P = 0.146). There was no difference in the obliteration prediction index and the radiosurgery-based AVM score between Groups A and B. The predicted rates of obliteration and excellent outcome were 55 and 62.5%, respectively, according to the obliteration prediction index and the radiosurgery-based AVM score. CONCLUSION: Embolization before radiosurgery significantly decreases the obliteration rate, even in AVMs with the same volume, location, and marginal dose.

37494960,Endovascular Treatment of Brain Arteriovenous Malformations in Pediatric Patients: A Single Center Experience and Review of the Literature.,"BACKGROUND: Brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) are abnormal vascular connections with direct arteriovenous shunts, generally symptomatic in the adult life. However, a small number of bAVMs may manifest in pediatric patients, with higher bleeding risk and mortality rates when compared to adults. The purpose of this study is to review our experience with endovascular treatment of bAVMs in pediatric patients. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of all bAVMs in pediatric patients (0-18 years) who underwent diagnostic digital subtraction angiography (DSA) at our institution from January 2010 to June 2021. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients met the inclusion criteria, of which 12 underwent endovascular treatment. Treated patients had a mean age of 10.25 years and 58% were females. Complete angiographic exclusion was achieved in five (42%) patients with endovascular treatment. Five patients with residual bAVM after embolization needed adjuvant therapy with surgery (n = 3) or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS; n = 2). Two patients are still undergoing embolization sessions. Procedure-related complications occurred in two patients (17%) and included small vessel perforation and an occipital ischemic stroke. Two patients showed bAVM recurrence on follow-up (17%) and subsequently underwent SRS (n = 1) or surgery (n = 1), both resulting in complete bAVM exclusion. All patients had a modified Rankin scale (mRS) score of 0 to 2 on follow-up. CONCLUSION: Our experience supports the effectiveness and safety of endovascular treatment of bAVM in selected pediatric patients. A multidisciplinary approach combining surgery and SRS is warranted to achieve higher complete bAVM obliteration rates. Long-term follow-up is important as these lesions may show recurrence over time, especially in the pediatric population.",2024 Jul,2024,"Journal of neurological surgery.

33541896,Are Dynamic Arterial Spin-Labeling MRA and Time-Resolved Contrast-Enhanced MRA Suited for Confirmation of Obliteration following Gamma Knife Radiosurgery of Brain Arteriovenous Malformations?,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intra-arterial DSA has been traditionally used for confirmation of cure following gamma knife radiosurgery for AVMs. Our aim was to evaluate whether 4D arterial spin-labeling MRA and contrast-enhanced time-resolved MRA in combination can be an alternative to DSA for confirmation of AVM obliteration following gamma knife radiosurgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective study, 30 patients undergoing DSA for confirmation of obliteration following gamma knife radiosurgery for AVMs (criterion standard) also underwent MRA, including arterial spin-labeling MRA and contrast-enhanced time-resolved MRA. One dataset was technically unsatisfactory, and the case was excluded. The DSA and MRA datasets of 29 patients were independently and blindly evaluated by 2 observers regarding the presence/absence of residual AVMs. RESULTS: The mean time between gamma knife radiosurgery and follow-up DSA/MRA was 53 months (95% CI, 42-64 months; range, 22-168 months). MRA total scanning time was 9 minutes and 17 seconds. Residual AVMs were detected on DSA in 9 subjects (obliteration rate = 69%). All residual AVMs were detected on at least 1 MRA sequence. Arterial spin-labeling MRA and contrast-enhanced time-resolved MRA showed excellent specificity and positive predictive values individually (100%). However, their sensitivity and negative predictive values were suboptimal due to 1 false-negative with arterial spin-labeling MRA and 2 with contrast-enhanced time-resolved MRA (sensitivity = 88% and 77%, negative predictive values = 95% and 90%, respectively). Both sensitivity and negative predictive values increased to 100% if a composite assessment of both MRA sequences was performed. Diagnostic accuracy (receiver operating characteristic) and agreement (κ) are maximized using arterial spin-labeling MRA and contrast-enhanced time-resolved MRA in combination (area under receiver operating characteristic curve = 1, P < .001; κ = 1, P < .001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Combining arterial spin-labeling MRA with contrast-enhanced time-resolved MRA holds promise as an alternative to DSA for confirmation of obliteration following gamma knife radiosurgery for brain AVMs, having provided 100% sensitivity and specificity in the study. Their combined use also enables reliable characterization of residual lesions.",2021 Apr,2021,AJNR.

16466239,"Decision analysis for small, asymptomatic intracranial arteriovenous malformations.","OBJECT: Asymptomatic intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) represent a clinically challenging problem because of the complex decision making that must be undertaken prior to beginning any type of treatment. In addition, the relative infrequency of these lesions means that there is relatively little experience reported in the literature. The authors use a decision-analysis technique to model the considerations that go into determining the treatment of these lesions in an effort to quantify the various risks and overall benefits conferred by the following three treatment strategies: observation/natural history, microsurgery, and stereotactic radiosurgery. METHODS: The authors conducted a thorough literature search to elucidate the risks and outcomes associated with each treatment option. These values were used to build and run a comprehensive Markov model to determine a base-case analysis. All of the input variables were also subjected to sensitivity analysis to identify the most influential input variables and the crossover points in which favored strategies changed. The base-case analysis suggested that microsurgery was the favored treatment option because this hypothetical cohort accumulated 21.53 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over the course of the model compared with the 16.97 QALYs and 16.40 QALYs for stereotctic radiosurgery and observation, respectively. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that overall major neurological morbidity and mortality were the most influential input variables both perioperatively and during the radiosurgical ""latent"" period (that is, up to 2 years posttreatment). The maximum acceptable perioperative combined major neurological morbidity and mortality rate was 6.8%. The latent period combined major neurological morbidity and mortality would need to be 0.7% to make radiosurgery favorable in this analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this decision analysis model suggest that microsurgery in the hands of experienced cerebrovascular surgeons, who can expect a less than 6.8% combined rate of major neurological morbidity and mortality, offers patients a greater overall quality of life over time.",2001 Nov 15,2001,Neurosurgical focus,11,5,e7,eng,False,110507;10.3171/foc.2001.11.5.8,Journal Article;Review,"Algorithms;*Case Management;*Decision Support Techniques;Decision Trees;Embolization, Therapeutic;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery/*therapy;Microsurgery;Quality-Adjusted Life Years;Radiosurgery;Risk Assessment;Sensitivity and Specificity;Treatment Outcome",
15689641,Treatment of pediatric intracranial arteriovenous malformations with linear-accelerator-based stereotactic radiosurgery: the University of Pennsylvania experience.,"There are relatively few reports detailing the outcome of children and adolescents with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). We reviewed our experience over the past decade to determine whether the outcomes and toxicity were similar to those reported in adults. Seventeen patients 18 years of age or younger underwent linear-accelerator-based SRS. The targeted volume was greater than 3 cm(3) in 65% of cases (range 0.7-25 cm(3); median volume 6.9 cm(3)). The prescribed radiation doses varied from 16 to 18 Gy, with 70% receiving the highest dose. Using only angiographic data, the obliteration rate was 80% (8 of 10 patients), but using both MRA/MRI and angiographic data, it was 53% (9 of 17 patients). Four patients developed late effects potentially attributable to the radiation between 2 months and 3 years following SRS. One of these was transient and disappeared completely within a few days, but in the other 3 patients, the neurologic sequelae were permanent. Two of the 4 complications appeared to be due to radiation necrosis/edema, whereas the remaining 2 may have been due to vasculopathy. All 4 patients with complications had treatment volumes greater than 5 cm(3) (5.4, 6.9, 11.1, 16.4 cm(3)), all had a prescribed dose of 18 Gy and all had initially presented with an AVM hemorrhage. Linear-accelerator-based SRS is effective in obliterating most AVMs in children; however, the potential for late effects exists, especially for those patients with larger target volumes.",2004 Sep-Oct,2004,Pediatric neurosurgery,40,5,207-14,eng,False,82293;10.1159/000082293,Journal Article,Adolescent;Age Factors;Child;Cognition Disorders/etiology;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;*Postoperative Complications;Radiation Injuries;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome,

31064679,Assessing the volume of large cerebral arteriovenous malformations: Can the ABC/2 formula reliably predict true volume?,"BACKGROUND: Outcomes of stereotactic radiosurgery in the treatment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are volume-dependent. The ability to estimate AVM volume has significant value in guiding AVM management. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether AVM volume measurement calculated from the ABC/2 formula is accurate compared to volume calculated by a computer-assisted planimetric method for large AVMs. METHODS: Retrospective review of 42 intracranial AVMs >3 cm in diameter that underwent treatment with dose-staged hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT) from 2001 to 2018. Two raters independently measured pre- and post-HSRT volumes using both the ABC/2 formula and computer-assisted planimetry in a blinded fashion. Inter-rater reliability was assessed by calculation of intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Absolute volumes and percent volume change following HSRT as determined using the two methods were compared using paired t-tests, linear regression, and Bland-Altman plot analyses. RESULTS: The ICC between the 2 raters for planimetric and ABC/2 volumes was 0.859 and 0.799, respectively. ABC/2 volumes, 26.1 ± 26.6 cm(3), were statistically smaller than planimetric volumes, 28.6 ± 27.1 cm(3) (P = .008). Despite differences, the two methods were highly correlated (R(2) = 0.904, linear regression). The percent volume change following HSRT was significantly greater with the ABC/2 method than compared to planimetry (P = .009). CONCLUSION: The ABC/2 and planimetric methods are reproducible for measuring cerebral AVM volumes. Although the ABC/2 method of volume estimation underestimates planimetric AVM volume, the high correlation between the two suggests utility of the ABC/2 method if one understands its limits, particularly with respect to estimating change in AVM volume after treatment.",2019 Jul,2019,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society,65,,1-5,eng,False,S0967-5868(19)30546-6;10.1016/j.jocn.2019.04.038;S0967-5868(19)30546-6;10.1016/j.jocn.2019.04.038,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Female;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted/*methods;Imaging, Three-Dimensional/methods;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*pathology/surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Neuroimaging/*methods;Radiation Dose Hypofractionation;Radiosurgery/methods;Reproducibility of Results;Retrospective Studies;Tomography, X-Ray Computed;Treatment Outcome",ABC/2;Cerebral arteriovenous malformations;Planimetry;Radiosurgery;Volume
12134932,Stereotactic radiosurgery for pediatric intracranial arteriovenous malformations: the University of California at San Francisco experience.,"OBJECT: Stereotactic radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is an accepted treatment option, but few reports have been published on the results of this treatment in children. In this study the authors describe a series of pediatric patients with a minimum follow-up duration of 36 months. METHODS: From 1991 to 1997, 40 children (26 boys and 14 girls) with AVMs were treated with radiosurgery at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF). Follow-up information was available for 31 children (20 boys and 11 girls) in whom the median age at initial treatment was 11.2 years (range 3.4-17.5 years). The median follow-up duration was 60 months (range 6-99 months). Sixteen percent of the AVMs were Spetzler-Martin Grade II; 68%, Grade III; 10%, Grade IV; and 6%, Grade V. The mean volume of the AVMs was 5.37 cm3 and the median volume was 1.6 cm3. The mean marginal dose of radiation was 16.7 Gy and the median dose was 18 Gy (range 12-19 Gy). Angiography performed in 26 children confirmed obliteration of the AVM nidus in nine patients (35%), partial response in 16 patients (62%), and no response in one patient (4%). In five patients who refused angiography, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging revealed obliteration in two patients and partial response in three patients, bringing the overall obliteration rate associated with initial radiosurgery to 35%. Logistic regression analysis confirmed a significant correlation between marginal dose prescription and response (p = 0.025); in AVMs that received at least 18 Gy there was a 10-fold increase in the obliteration rate (63%) over AVMs that received a lower dose. Lesions smaller than 3 cm3 were associated with a six-fold increased obliteration rate (53%) over lesions larger than 3 cm3 (8%), but AVM volume was not a statistically significant predictor of response (p = 0.09). Twelve patients have since undergone repeated radiosurgery and are currently being followed up with serial MR imaging studies (in five cases, the AVM is now obliterated). During the follow-up period (1918 patient-months) there were eight hemorrhages in five patients, with a cumulative posttreatment hemorrhage rate of 3.2%/patient/year in the 1st year and a rate of 4.3%/patient/year over the first 3 years. There were two permanent neurological complications (6%) and no deaths in this study. CONCLUSIONS: The lower overall obliteration rate reported in this series is most likely due to the larger mean AVM volumes treated at UCSF as well as conservative dose-volume prescriptions delivered to children. Significantly higher obliteration rates were observed when a marginal radiation dose of at least 18 Gy was delivered. The permanent complication rate is low and should encourage those treating children to use doses similar to those used in adults.",2002 Jul,2002,Journal of neurosurgery,97,1,48-55,eng,False,10.3171/jns.2002.97.1.0048,Clinical Trial;Journal Article,"Academic Medical Centers;Adolescent;California;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;Postoperative Complications/diagnosis;*Radiosurgery;Recurrence;Treatment Outcome",
33291154,"Brain Arteriovenous Malformations: Impact of Neurologic Status, Bleeding, and Type of Treatment on Final Outcome.","BACKGROUND: Well-designed studies assessing the treatment outcome of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are infrequent and have not consistently included all of the available treatment modalities, making their results not completely generalizable. Moreover, the predictors of poor outcome are not well defined. METHODS: We performed an observational retrospective study of AVM patients. We included patients with clinical, radiologic, and outcome data, with a minimum follow-up of 1 year. Neurologic outcome was documented using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at the AVM diagnosis and 30 days after the treatment. RESULTS: There were 117 patients, with equal male/female proportion. The mean follow-up time was 51 months. Treatment distribution in the Spetzler-Martin grades I-III was as follows: 52 (54.6%) surgery, 31 (32.35%) radiosurgery, 2 (0.02%) embolization, and 11 (12%) conservative follow-up. Treatment distribution in Spetzler-Martin grades IV and V was as follows: 4 (20%) surgery, 7 (35%) radiosurgery, and 10 (45%) conservative follow-up. Poor neurologic outcome (mRS ≥ 3) was significantly associated with poor clinical status at diagnosis (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score< 14; odds ratio [OR]: 0.20; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.001-0.396; p = 0.010). The rupture of the AVM was associated with poor neurologic outcome. The Lawton-Young Supplementary scale (LYSS) proved to be the most effective in predicting poor outcome. The existence of seizures, treatment-related complications, and conservative treatment was associated with the worsening of the mRS score, whereas the existence of hemorrhage was associated with the likelihood of disability. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that poor neurologic status at diagnosis, AVM rupture, and conservative treatment were associated with worse outcome. Hemorrhage as initial presentation is related to disability, not with mRS worsening. The LYSS appeared to be the best method to predict outcome.",2021 Mar,2021,"Journal of neurological surgery.

26530856,Treatment of Brain AVMs (TOBAS): study protocol for a pragmatic randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: The management of unruptured brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM) patients remains controversial. Furthermore, curative attempts to treat ruptured AVM patients have not been questioned so far, and there is a lack of prospective data on clinical results according to treatment modality. Endovascular treatment is often used aiming to improve the safety or efficacy of surgery or radiation therapy, but benefits have never been documented in a trial. A care trial context is needed to evaluate interventions at the same time they are practised. METHODS/TRIAL DESIGN: TOBAS is a pragmatic, prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial and registry which offers a care trial context for brain AVM patients, including surgical resection, radiosurgery or endovascular embolization, alone or combined. The study includes two RCTs and a multimodality prospective registry. The objectives of the proposed study are to assess whether preventive interventions (surgery, embolization, radiation therapy, alone or combined), selected by the local treatment team and performed as locally practiced, randomly allocated and compared with conservative management, in unruptured brain AVM patients eligible for active or conservative management, can improve the proportion of patients having an independent outcome (modified Rankin Scale (mRS) < 3, as assessed by a standardized questionnaire administered by non-masked care personnel) at 10 years. All patients judged ineligible for randomized allocation are to be entered in a multimodal registry. The objective of a nested trial in patients with ruptured or unruptured AVMs to be treated by surgery or radiation therapy, is to assess whether pre-surgical or pre-radiation embolization, randomly allocated and compared with no embolization, can improve the proportion of patients with complete eradication of the AVM, as locally adjudicated, combined with a good clinical outcome (mRS < 3). The study will require up to 2000 patients in approximately 30 centers or more, followed for 10 years.

10719855,Posttreatment sequelae of palliatively treated cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVE: Posttreatment sequelae of palliatively treated cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) were studied to evaluate the significance of these nonradical treatments. METHODS: Between 1987 and 1997, 46 patients with cerebral AVMs were managed with treatments such as partial embolization, radiosurgery, subtotal resection, or feeder ligation alone. Their AVMs were not radically resected because of difficulties in radical treatment, hesitance to treat eloquent area lesions, or residual nidi after subtotal obliteration. The patients' posttreatment sequelae were evaluated. The duration of follow-up ranged from 0.5 to 169 months (mean, 49.4+/-39.8 mo). RESULTS: Twenty-six bleeding episodes from AVMs were documented in 18 patients. The annual risk of bleeding in this palliatively treated group was 14.6%. Persistent progressive neurological deficit was observed in one patient. Major neurological deficits occurred in 10 patients (23.3%), and the mortality rate was 9.3%. CONCLUSION: Palliative treatments cannot prevent bleeding and may even worsen the posttreatment course compared with the natural history of cerebral AVMs. A more conservative indication is required in recommending palliative treatment alone.",2000 Mar,2000,Neurosurgery,46,3,589-94; discussion 594-5,eng,False,10.1097/00006123-200003000-00013,Journal Article,"Carotid Arteries/diagnostic imaging;Cerebral Angiography;Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology;Embolization, Therapeutic/methods;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/mortality/*therapy;Ligation;Longitudinal Studies;Nervous System Diseases/etiology;*Palliative Care/methods;Postoperative Complications;Radiosurgery/methods;Retrospective Studies",
31538418,Gamma Knife Radiosurgery for ARUBA-Eligible Patients with Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformations.,"BACKGROUND: A randomized trial of unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations (ARUBA) reported superior outcomes in conservative management compared to interventional treatment. There were numerous limitations to the study. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS) for patients with brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) by comparing its outcomes to those of the ARUBA study. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed ARUBA-eligible patients treated with GKS from June 2002 to September 2017 and compared against those in the ARUBA study. AVM obliteration and hemorrhage rates, and clinical outcomes following GKS were also evaluated. RESULTS: The ARUBA-eligible cohort comprised 264 patients. The Spetzler-Martin grade was Grade I to II in 52.7% and III to IV in 47.3% of the patients. The mean AVM nidus volume, marginal dose, and follow-up period were 4.8 cm³, 20.8 Gy, and 55.5 months, respectively. AVM obliteration was achieved in 62.1%. The annual hemorrhage rate after GKS was 3.4%. A stroke or death occurred in 14.0%. The overall stroke or death rate of the ARUBA-eligible cohort was significantly lower than that of the interventional arm of the ARUBA study (P < 0.001) and did not significantly differ from that of the medical arm in the ARUBA study (P = 0.601). CONCLUSION: GKS was shown to achieve a favorable outcome with low procedure-related morbidity in majority of the ARUBA-eligible patients. The outcome after GKS in our patients was not inferior to that of medical care alone in the ARUBA study. It is suggested that GKS is rather superior to medical care considering the short follow-up duration of the ARUBA study.",2019 Sep 23,2019,Journal of Korean medical science,34,36,e232,eng,True,10.3346/jkms.2019.34.e232;e232;34.e232;10.3346/jkms.2019.34.e232,Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Hemorrhage/*etiology;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/mortality/pathology/*surgery;Kaplan-Meier Estimate;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects;Retrospective Studies;Risk;Severity of Illness Index;Stroke/*etiology;Young Adult,ARUBA Study;Arteriovenous Malformation;Gamma Knife Radiosurgery;Intracranial Hemorrhage;Stroke
26548816,Angioarchitecture and Posttreatment Magnetic Resonance Imaging Characteristics of Brain Arteriovenous Malformations and Long-Term Seizure Control After Radiosurgery.,"OBJECTIVE: To corroborate which pretreatment angioarchitectural characteristics and posttreatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features were associated with better seizure and antiepileptic drug outcomes in patients with brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) treated by Gamma Knife radiosurgery. METHODS: During the period 2007-2010, 220 patients with intracranial AVMs undergoing radiosurgery at our hospital were evaluated. Imaging features on digital subtraction angiography and follow-up MRI, medical records, and direct patient interview were retrospectively assessed. Seizure outcome was assessed using the Engel classification and the status of antiepileptic drug use. RESULTS: At the last follow-up, 21 of 31 patients (68%) who met the recruitment criteria had AVM obliteration on digital subtraction angiography or MRI. Seizure-free status (Engel class 1) was achieved in 20 patients (65%), and 13 of 20 (65%) seizure-free patients were medication-free. The presence of total obliteration at last imaging follow-up (P = 0.013), absent retrograde cortical veins on digital subtraction angiography before GKRS (P = 0.013), nidus <3.7 cm (P = 0.006), and lower modified radiosurgery-based AVM score (P = 0.026) were significant predictors of seizure-free outcome. The strongest independent predictor of seizure-free status was absence of retrograde veins (odds ratio = 9.9). No angioarchitectural feature, postradiosurgery imaging finding on MRI, or radiosurgical treatment parameter was a significant predictor of seizure control or cessation of medication in seizure-free patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that radiosurgery provides favorable outcomes in patients with AVM-related epilepsy. Patients with intracranial AVMs can benefit from seizure control after GKRS before undergoing AVM obliteration. Absence of retrograde veins is associated with better seizure-free outcomes, regardless of the parenchymal changes after radiosurgery.",2016 Mar,2016,World neurosurgery,87,,277-82,eng,True,S1878-8750(15)01488-6;10.1016/j.wneu.2015.10.070;S1878-8750(15)01488-6;10.1016/j.wneu.2015.10.070,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adult;Angiography, Digital Subtraction;Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use;Cerebral Angiography;Databases, Factual;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/*pathology/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Neurosurgical Procedures/*methods;Radiosurgery/*methods;Retrospective Studies;Seizures/*etiology/surgery;Treatment Outcome",Angioarchitecture;Arteriovenous malformation;Gamma Knife radiosurgery;MRI;Seizure outcome

29769453,Comparison of the Long-term Efficacy and Safety of Gamma Knife Radiosurgery for Arteriovenous Malformations in Pediatric and Adult Patients.,"It is debated whether the efficacy and long-term safety of gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) differs between adult and pediatric patients. We aimed to clarify the long-term outcomes of GKRS in pediatric patients and how they compare to those in adult patients. We collected data for 736 consecutive patients with AVMs treated with GKRS between 1990 and 2014 and divided the patients into pediatric (age < 20 years, n = 144) and adult (age ≥ 20 years, n = 592) cohorts. The mean follow-up period in the pediatric cohort was 130 months. Compared to the adult patients, the pediatric patients were significantly more likely to have a history of hemorrhage (P < 0.001). The actuarial rates of post-GKRS nidus obliteration in the pediatric cohort were 36%, 60%, and 87% at 2, 3, and 6 years, respectively. Nidus obliteration occurred earlier in the pediatric cohort than in the adult cohort (P = 0.015). The actuarial rates of post-GKRS hemorrhage in the pediatric cohort were 0.7%, 2.5%, and 2.5% at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively. Post-GKRS hemorrhage was marginally less common in the pediatric cohort than in the adult cohort (P = 0.056). Cyst formation/encapsulated hematoma were detected in seven pediatric patients (4.9%) at a median post-GKRS timepoint of 111 months, which was not significantly different from the rate in the adult cohort. Compared to adult patients, pediatric patients experience earlier therapeutic effects from GKRS for AVMs, and this improves long-term outcomes.",2018 Jun 15,2018,Neurologia medico-chirurgica,58,6,231-239,eng,True,10.2176/nmc.st.2018-0008;nmc-58-231;10.2176/nmc.st.2018-0008,Comparative Study;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Age Factors;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Child;Child, Preschool;Cohort Studies;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*radiotherapy;Male;Middle Aged;*Radiosurgery;Time Factors;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",arteriovenous malformation;gamma knife;pediatric patients;stereotactic radiosurgery
11014422,Radiosurgery for childhood intracranial arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVE: The optimal management of intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in children remains controversial. Children with intracranial AVMs present a special challenge in therapeutic decision-making because of the early recognition of their future life-long risks of hemorrhage if they are treated conservatively. The goals of radiosurgery are to achieve complete AVM obliteration and to preserve neurological function. We present long-term outcomes for a series of children treated using radiosurgery. METHODS: The findings for 53 consecutive children who underwent at least 36 months of imaging follow-up monitoring after radiosurgery were reviewed. The median age at the time of treatment was 12 years (range, 2-17 yr). Thirty-one children (58%) presented after their first intracranial hemorrhaging episodes, two (4%) after their second hemorrhaging episodes, and one (2%) after five hemorrhaging episodes. Nineteen children (36%) presented with unruptured AVMs, and a total of 25 children (47%) exhibited neurological deficits. AVMs were graded as Spetzler-Martin Grade I (2%), Grade II (23%), Grade III (36%), Grade IV (9%), or Grade VI (30%). The median AVM volume was 1.7 ml (range, 0.11-10.2 ml). The median marginal dose was 20 Gy (range, 15-25 Gy). RESULTS: Results were stratified according to AVM volumes (Group 1, < or =3 ml; Group 2, >3 ml to < or =10 ml; Group 3, >10 ml). Twenty-eight patients (80%) in Group 1 and 11 (64.7%) in Group 2 achieved complete obliteration. The only patient in Group 3 did not achieve obliteration. Complications included brainstem edema (n = 1) and transient pulmonary edema (n = 1). Four patients experienced hemorrhaging episodes, 30, 40, 84, and 96 months after radiosurgery. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that only volume was significantly correlated with obliteration rates (P = 0.0109). CONCLUSION: Radiosurgery is safe and efficacious for selected children with AVMs. The obliteration rates and the attendant low morbidity rates suggest a primary role for stereotactic radiosurgery for pediatric AVMs.",2000 Oct,2000,Neurosurgery,47,4,834-41; discussion 841-2,eng,False,10.1097/00006123-200010000-00008,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology;Child;Child, Preschool;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/*surgery;Postoperative Complications;*Radiosurgery;Treatment Outcome",
23863762,Magnetic resonance imaging assessment of cerebral arteriovenous malformation obliteration after stereotactic radiosurgery.,"BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiosurgery is ideal for treating small cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) that are surgically inaccessible. However, given the inherent delay of AVM obliteration and the potential for radiosurgical failure, detailed evaluation of the neurovascular architecture is necessary to monitor persistence of residual flow. Modern imaging systems such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and angiography allow clinicians to assess transnidus flow after radiosurgical intervention. OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy of an MRI diagnosis of complete thrombosis and to identify variables that affect the precision of MRI assessment. METHODS: One hundred twenty patients were reviewed after receiving radiosurgery at the University of Florida from 1990 to 2010. Each patient had an MRI demonstrating AVM obliteration and an angiogram either confirming or denying AVM thrombosis. RESULTS: MRI correctly predicted complete AVM obliteration in 82% of patients. There was a significant correlation between AVM volume and MRI accuracy in 2 separate models. In the first model, logistic regression analysis revealed a significant linear relationship between the natural log of AVM volume and MRI accuracy. The second model showed significant evidence of a cutoff point in MRI accuracy near an AVM volume of 2.80 cm(3), above which MRI agreement with angiography is 90% and below which MRI agreement falls off sharply to remain constant at 70%. CONCLUSION: MRI is a useful diagnostic system for assessing AVM obliteration, but its accuracy is inherently linked to the nidus volume it is measuring. These results suggest that MRI may be able to take on an increasingly independent role in the evaluation of AVM regression.",2013 Nov,2013,Neurosurgery,73,5,761-6,eng,False,10.1227/NEU.0000000000000086;10.1227/NEU.0000000000000086,"Journal Article;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnosis/*surgery;Logistic Models;Longitudinal Studies;*Magnetic Resonance Angiography;*Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Probability;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;*Treatment Outcome,
37619837,Preradiosurgical Embolization of Arteriovenous Malformations Reduces Target Volume - The Main Determinant for Complete Obliteration.,"BACKGROUND: Embolization and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) have increasingly been used to treat complex arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). We studied outcomes of AVM patients treated through a multidisciplinary approach, examined the effect of embolization on SRS success, and analyzed predictors of treatment failure. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed a prospectively maintained database of patients with AVMs treated with Gamma Knife (Leksell) SRS over an 11-year period. Patients with incomplete medical records and follow-up <2 years were excluded. Demographics, clinical presentation, previous rupture history, angiographic nidus size, Spetzler-Martin (S-M) grade, adjunctive endovascular embolization and microsurgical resection, radiologic evidence of obliteration and hemorrhage, and clinical outcomes (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] scores) were recorded. Radiosurgery-related details including nidus volume and number of sessions and radiosurgery-, embolization-, and resection-associated complications were also recorded. RESULTS: Eighty-three patients (mean age, 41.0 ± 21.3 years) were included. Mean reduction in AVM nidus target volume with endovascular embolization was 66.0 ± 19.7%. S-M grade reduction was achieved in 51.6% cases. Total obliteration after SRS was achieved in 56 AVMs (67.5%) after 2 years, and in 38 (86.4%) after 4 years. Two (2.4%) patients had rehemorrhage after SRS. Overall complication rate was 3.6%. Median angiographic follow-up was 55.5 months. Favorable outcomes (mRS = 0-2) were seen in 77.1%. SRS target volume was an independent predictor of treatment failure regardless of pre-SRS embolization. CONCLUSIONS: High AVM obliteration rates were achieved with judicious use of radiosurgery alone or with embolization. Embolization reduced target nidus volume by an average of 66%.

32860409,Embolization of Brain Arteriovenous Malformations With Versus Without Onyx Before Stereotactic Radiosurgery.,"BACKGROUND: Embolization of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) using ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer (Onyx) embolization may influence the treatment effects of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) differently than other embolysates. OBJECTIVE: To compare the outcomes of pre-SRS AVM embolization with vs without Onyx through a multicenter, retrospective matched cohort study. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed International Radiosurgery Research Foundation AVM databases from 1987 to 2018. Embolized AVMs treated with SRS were selected and categorized based on embolysate usage into Onyx embolization (OE + SRS) or non-Onyx embolization (NOE + SRS) cohorts. The 2 cohorts were matched in a 1:1 ratio using de novo AVM features for comparative analysis of outcomes. RESULTS: The matched cohorts each comprised 45 patients. Crude AVM obliteration rates were similar between the matched OE + SRS vs NOE + SRS cohorts (47% vs 51%; odds ratio [OR] = 0.837, P = .673). Cumulative probabilities of obliteration were also similar between the OE + SRS vs NOE + SRS cohorts (subhazard ratio = 0.992, P = .980). Rates of post-SRS hemorrhage, all-cause mortality, radiation-induced changes, cyst formation, and embolization-associated complications were similar between the matched cohorts. Sensitivity analysis for AVMs in the OE + SRS cohort embolized with Onyx alone revealed a higher rate of asymptomatic embolization-associated complications in this subgroup compared to the NOE + SRS cohort (36% vs 15%; OR = 3.297, P = .034), but the symptomatic complication rates were similar. CONCLUSION: Nidal embolization using Onyx does not appear to differentially impact the outcomes of AVM SRS compared with non-Onyx embolysates. The embolic agent selected for pre-SRS AVM embolization should reflect both the experience of the neurointerventionalist and target of endovascular intervention.",2021 Jan 13,2021,Neurosurgery,88,2,366-374,eng,False,10.1093/neuros/nyaa370;5898932;10.1093/neuros/nyaa370,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Cohort Studies;Embolization, Therapeutic/*methods;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*therapy;Male;Middle Aged;Polyvinyls/*therapeutic use;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome",Arteriovenous malformation;Embolization;Endovascular;Stereotactic radiosurgery;Stroke

This long-term study of 42 patients with high-grade AVMs reports obliteration and adverse event (AE) rates using planned multistage repeat stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of multistage SRS with treatment of the entire AVM nidus at each treatment session to achieve complete obliteration of high-grade AVMs. METHODS: Patients with high-grade Spetzler-Martin (S-M) III-V AVMs treated with at least 2 multistage SRS treatments from 1989 to 2013. Clinical outcomes of obliteration rate, minor/major AEs, and treatment characteristics were collected. RESULTS: Forty-two patients met inclusion criteria (n = 26, S-M III; n = 13, S-M IV; n = 3, S-M V) with a median follow-up was 9.5 yr after first SRS. Median number of SRS treatment stages was 2, and median interval between stages was 3.5 yr. Twenty-two patients underwent pre-SRS embolization. Complete AVM obliteration rate was 38%, and the median time to obliteration was 9.7 yr. On multivariate analysis, higher S-M grade was significantly associated ( P = .04) failure to achieve obliteration. Twenty-seven post-SRS AEs were observed, and the post-SRS intracranial hemorrhage rate was 0.027 events per patient year. CONCLUSION: Treatment of high-grade AVMs with multistage SRS achieves AVM obliteration in a meaningful proportion of patients with acceptable AE rates. Lower obliteration rates were associated with higher S-M grade and pre-SRS embolization. This approach should be considered with caution, as partial obliteration does not protect from hemorrhage.",2017 Jul 1,2017,Neurosurgery,81,1,136-146,eng,True,10.1093/neuros/nyw041;2995883;10.1093/neuros/nyw041,Journal Article;Observational Study,Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Child;Clinical Protocols;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*radiotherapy;Male;Middle Aged;Radiation Dosage;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult,AVM;Cerebral arteriovenous malformation;Inoperable high-grade AVM;Multistage SRS;Stereotactic radiosurgery

15913912,"Comparison of imaging modalities for the accurate delineation of arteriovenous malformation, with reference to stereotactic radiosurgery.","PURPOSE: To investigate the discrepancy between the arteriovenous malformations seen on magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and on stereotactic digital subtracted angiography (DSA). METHODS AND MATERIALS: The target volume on stereotactic DSA (V(DSA)) and the target volume on MRA (V(MRA)) were separately delineated in 28 intracranial arteriovenous malformations. The coordinates of the center and the outer edges of V(DSA) and V(MRA) were calculated and used for the analyses. RESULTS: The standard deviations (mean value) of the displacement of centers of V(MRA) from V(DSA) were 2.67 mm (-1.82 mm) in the left-right direction, 3.23 mm (-0.08 mm) in the anterior-posterior direction, and 2.16 mm (0.91 mm) in the craniocaudal direction. V(MRA) covered less than 80% of V(DSA) in any dimensions in 9 cases (32%), although no significant difference was seen in the target volume between each method, with a mean value of 11.9 cc for V(DSA) and 12.3 cc for V(MRA) (p = 0.948). CONCLUSION: The shift of centers between each modality is not negligible. Considering no significant difference between V(DSA) and V(MRA), but inadequate coverage of the V(DSA) by V(MRA), it is reasonable to consider that the target on MRA might include the feeding artery and draining vein and possibly miss a portion of the nidus.",2005 Jul 15,2005,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",62,4,1232-8,eng,False,S0360-3016(05)00573-0;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2005.03.039,Comparative Study;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;*Angiography, Digital Subtraction/standards;Female;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/surgery;*Magnetic Resonance Angiography;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery",

METHODS: We reviewed data from 100 children (44 girls and 56 boys) presenting a total of 103 AVMs treated by linear accelerator radiosurgery between December 1988 and May 2002. The median patient age was 12 years (range, 2-16 yr). Sixty-seven AVMs (65%) were in functional locations and 30% were inoperable. The mean AVM volume was 2.8 cm3 (range, 0.9-21.3 cm3). The mean marginal dose was 23 Gy (range, 15-25 Gy) and required between one and four isocenters. Fifty patients received multimodal treatments with embolization and/or surgery before and/or after radiosurgery. Given that 16 patients underwent two sessions of radiosurgery and one patient received three sessions, a total of 119 radiosurgical treatments were delivered. We maintained our clinical and angiographic follow-up for at least 36 months after irradiation or until the complete obliteration of the AVM was confirmed by angiography (our sole end point for judging clinical efficacy). Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to determine predictive factors for obliteration. RESULTS: Complete obliteration was achieved for 72 AVMs (70%). The permanent neurological deficit rate was 5%. One patient died because of rebleeding. None of our patients presented bleeding after an angiographically verified AVM obliteration. The main predictive factors for obliteration were low AVM volume and no previous embolization. Moreover, the younger the patient, the more effective the radiosurgery seemed to be. CONCLUSION: Radiosurgery is a safe and effective treatment for AVMs in the pediatric age group. One criterion for success was the use of a prescription dose similar to that used with adult populations.",2007 Feb,2007,Neurosurgery,60,2,268-76; discussion 276,eng,False,00006123-200702000-00007;10.1227/01.NEU.0000249277.72063.BD,Comparative Study;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Age Factors;Child;Child, Preschool;Disease Management;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*epidemiology/pathology/*surgery;Male;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies",
28710086,Onyx embolization prior to stereotactic radiosurgery for brain arteriovenous malformations: a single-center treatment algorithm.,"BACKGROUND: Embolization before stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVMs) is controversial. OBJECTIVE: To compare clinical and radiographic outcomes in patients undergoing pre-SRS embolization with ethylene copolymer (Onyx) with outcomes in patients undergoing SRS alone. METHODS: Seventy consecutive patients with BAVMs who underwent SRS were retrospectively reviewed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the factors associated with radiographic obliteration and complication. RESULTS: Forty-one (59%) patients presented without BAVM rupture and 29 (41%) patients presented with rupture. Pre-SRS embolization was used in 20 patients (28.6%; 7 unruptured and 13 ruptured). Twenty-five of 70 (36%) patients sustained a complication from treatment, including 6 (9%) patients with a post-SRS latency period hemorrhage. Ten (14%) patients had persistent neurological deficits after treatment. Functional outcome (as modified Rankin Scale), complication rate, and radiographic obliteration at last follow-up were not significantly different between embolized and non-embolized groups in both unruptured and ruptured BAVMs. For unruptured BAVMs, 3- and 5-year rates of radiographic obliteration were 23% and 73% for non-embolized patients and 20% and 60% for embolized patients, respectively. For ruptured BAVMs, 3- and 5-year rates of radiographic obliteration were 45% and 72% for non-embolized patients and 53% and 82% for embolized patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: Pre-SRS embolization with Onyx was not associated with worse clinical or radiographic outcomes than SRS treatment without embolization.

29890278,Combined Endovascular and Microsurgical Treatment of Arteriovenous Malformations in the Hybrid Operating Room.,"BACKGROUND: Radical treatment of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) remains a challenge despite recent advances in endovascular, microsurgical, and stereotactic radiosurgery treatments. The radical removal of AVMs with prevention of hemorrhage can be achieved through either single or combined modalities. Our retrospective study summarizes the safety and efficacy of combined endovascular embolization and microsurgical removal of AVMs in 49 consecutive patients in the hybrid operating room (hOR). METHODS: Patients underwent nonhybrid (i.e., endovascular, stereotactic radiosurgery, observation, combination) or hybrid (i.e., endovascular with microsurgery in hOR) treatment. The variables analyzed included age, sex, hospitalization time, Spetzler-Martin/Buffalo grades, clinical symptoms, previous treatment, intraoperative digital angiographic (iDSA) findings, postsurgical treatment, operation duration, complications, obliteration rate, and remnants. RESULTS: Of 18 patients treated in the hOR, 15 (83%) presented with Spetzler-Martin grades I and II and were younger than those treated with other modalities (mean age, 41 vs. 46 years). Thirteen (87%) patients were admitted with signs of hemorrhage after AVM rupture. The initial surgical plan was modified in 3 (17%) of 18 cases based on iDSA findings. All patients who eventually underwent microsurgical removal of AVMs showed neither postinterventional remnant nor new neurologic signs and symptoms. Complications included 1 postoperative epidural hematoma and 1 vasospasm during endovascular treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of AVMs in the hOR offers the possibility to adapt surgical approaches based on iDSA findings after intraoperative embolization, thus achieving better clinical and radiologic results. Radical treatment of AVMs with low Spetzler-Martin grades by combining endovascular and microsurgical techniques in the hOR was technically feasible, effective, and safe.",2018 Sep,2018,World neurosurgery,117,,e204-e214,eng,False,S1878-8750(18)31195-1;10.1016/j.wneu.2018.05.241;S1878-8750(18)31195-1;10.1016/j.wneu.2018.05.241,Journal Article,"Adult;Combined Modality Therapy;Computed Tomography Angiography;Embolization, Therapeutic/methods;Endovascular Procedures/methods;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/*therapy;Intracranial Hemorrhages/etiology/surgery;Magnetic Resonance Angiography;Male;Microsurgery/*methods;Middle Aged;Multimodal Imaging/methods;Neuroendoscopy/*methods;Operating Rooms;Radiosurgery/methods;Rupture, Spontaneous",Cerebral arteriovenous malformation;Endovascular treatment;Hybrid operating room;Intraoperative angiography;Microsurgical treatment

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all patients ≤ 18 years of age with cerebral AVMs that underwent microsurgical resection at Rady Children's Hospital 2002-2019. RESULTS: Eighty-nine patients met inclusion criteria. The mean age was 10.3 ± 5.0 years, and 56% of patients were male. In total, 72 (81%) patients presented with rupture. Patients with unruptured AVMs presented with headache (n = 5, 29.4%), seizure (n = 9, 52.9%), or incidental finding (n = 3, 17.7%). The mean presenting mRS was 2.8 ± 1.8. AVM location was lobar in 78%, cerebellar/brainstem in 15%, and deep supratentorial in 8%. Spetzler-Martin grade was I in 28%, II in 45%, III in 20%, IV in 6%, and V in 1%. Preoperative embolization was utilized in 38% of patients and more frequently in unruptured than ruptured AVMs (62% vs. 32%, p = 0.022).

32029465,Follow-Up MRI for Small Brain AVMs Treated by Radiosurgery: Is Gadolinium Really Necessary?,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Follow-up MR imaging of brain AVMs currently relies on contrast-enhanced sequences. Noncontrast techniques, including arterial spin-labeling and TOF, may have value in detecting a residual nidus after radiosurgery. The aim of this study was to compare noncontrast with contrast-enhanced MR imaging for the differentiation of residual-versus-obliterated brain AVMs in radiosurgically treated patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight consecutive patients with small brain AVMs (<20 mm) treated by radiosurgery were followed with the same MR imaging protocol. Three neuroradiologists, blinded to the results, independently reviewed the following: 1) postcontrast images alone (4D contrast-enhanced MRA and postcontrast 3D T1 gradient recalled-echo), 2) arterial spin-labeling and TOF images alone, and 3) all MR images combined. The primary end point was the detection of residual brain AVMs using a 5-point scale, with DSA as the reference standard. RESULTS: The highest interobserver agreement was for arterial spin-labeling/TOF (κ = 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.66-0.93). Regarding brain AVM detection, arterial spin-labeling/TOF had higher sensitivity (sensitivity, 85%; specificity, 100%; 95% CI, 62-97) than contrast-enhanced MR imaging (sensitivity, 55%; specificity, 100%; 95% CI, 27-73) and all MR images combined (sensitivity, 75%; specificity, 100%; 95% CI, 51-91) (P = .008). All nidus obliterations on DSA were detected on MR imaging. In 6 patients, a residual brain AVM present on DSA was only detected with arterial spin-labeling/TOF, including 3 based solely on arterial spin-labeling images. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of radiosurgically treated patients with small brain AVMs, arterial spin-labeling/TOF was found to be superior to gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging in detecting residual AVMs.",2020 Mar,2020,AJNR.

20801584,Technique for targeting arteriovenous malformations using frameless image-guided robotic radiosurgery.,"PURPOSE: To integrate three-dimensional (3D) digital rotation angiography (DRA) and two-dimensional (2D) digital subtraction angiography (DSA) imaging into a targeting methodology enabling comprehensive image-guided robotic radiosurgery of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). METHODS AND MATERIALS: DRA geometric integrity was evaluated by imaging a phantom with embedded markers. Dedicated DSA acquisition modes with preset C-arm positions were configured. The geometric reproducibility of the presets was determined, and its impact on localization accuracy was evaluated. An imaging protocol composed of anterior-posterior and lateral DSA series in combination with a DRA run without couch displacement between acquisitions was introduced. Software was developed for registration of DSA and DRA (2D-3D) images to correct for: (a) small misalignments of the C-arm with respect to the estimated geometry of the set positions and (b) potential patient motion between image series. Within the software, correlated navigation of registered DRA and DSA images was incorporated to localize AVMs within a 3D image coordinate space. Subsequent treatment planning and delivery followed a standard image-guided robotic radiosurgery process. RESULTS: DRA spatial distortions were typically smaller than 0.3 mm throughout a 145-mm × 145-mm × 145-mm volume. With 2D-3D image registration, localization uncertainties resulting from the achievable reproducibility of the C-arm set positions could be reduced to about 0.2 mm. Overall system-related localization uncertainty within the DRA coordinate space was 0.4 mm. Image-guided frameless robotic radiosurgical treatments with this technique were initiated. CONCLUSIONS: The integration of DRA and DSA into the process of nidus localization increases the confidence with which radiosurgical ablation of AVMs can be performed when using only an image-guided technique. Such an approach can increase patient comfort, decrease time pressure on clinical and technical staff, and possibly reduce the number of cerebral angiograms needed for a particular patient.",2011 Mar 15,2011,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",79,4,1232-40,eng,False,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2010.05.015;S0360-3016(10)00691-7;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2010.05.015,Journal Article,"Angiography, Digital Subtraction/*methods;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Movement;Phantoms, Imaging;Radiosurgery/*methods;Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted/methods;Reproducibility of Results;*Robotics;Software;Tomography, X-Ray Computed/methods;Young Adult",
11404718,[Postoperative morbidity and mortality after microsurgical exclusion of cerebral arteriovenous malformations. Current data and analysis of recent literature].,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Microsurgical exclusion of a cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) can compare favorably with radiosurgery. We sought to assess its rate of morbidity-mortality as it is presently reported in the literature, and to discuss some of its current and worthwhile indications. METHODS: Through Medline and additional searches by hand, we retrieved studies reporting the clinical and angiographic results after microsurgical excision of an AVM published between january 1990 and december 2000. RESULTS: a) Postoperative mortality was 3.3% (68/2 452 patients from 25 studies). Permanent postoperative morbidity was 8.6%. Morbidity was never absent varying from 1.5% to 18,7%. The morbidity-mortality rate increased with an increasing Spetzler-Martin's grade, and was related to the location of the AVM. A 4.6% morbidity (from 1.5% to 9.7%) and a zero mortality were reported after microsurgical removal of small lesions of less than 3 cm in diameter. b) Postoperative angiography confirmed a total excision of the AVM in 97% of the cases (1 050/1 076 patients over 11 series), varying from 91% to 100%. c) Permanent morbidity related to pre-surgical embolization varied from 4% to 8.9%. Results from multiple or combined treatment including microsurgery could not be summed up. CONCLUSIONS: A complete and definitive microsurgical excision of an AVM can be achieved with a high success rate and a low morbidity-mortality rate, according to sound indications and to the neurosurgeon's personal experience. The choice for a best treatment of an AVM is no longer limited to microsurgery; it is a team decision where the neurosurgeon plays a determining role.",2001 May,2001,Neuro-Chirurgie,47,2-3 Pt 2,369-83,fre,False,75758,Comparative Study;Journal Article;Review,"Adult;Aged;Brain Damage, Chronic/epidemiology/*etiology;Case Management;Cerebral Angiography;Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology/surgery;Child;Combined Modality Therapy;Comorbidity;Cost-Benefit Analysis;Embolization, Therapeutic;Emergencies;Female;France/epidemiology;Hematoma/etiology/surgery;Humans;Intracranial Aneurysm/epidemiology/etiology/surgery;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/diagnostic;Male;Microsurgery/*adverse effects/economics/methods/mortality;Middle Aged;Postoperative Complications/epidemiology/*etiology/mortality;Prospective Studies;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects/economics/mortality;Retrospective Studies;Severity of Illness Index;Treatment Outcome",
35074545,Curative Embolization for Pediatric Spetzler-Martin Grade III Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformations.,"OBJECTIVE: Spetzler-Martin (SM) grade III arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) represent a gray zone due to their high variability in location, size, and angioarchitecture. In addition, there is a lack of information on curative embolization in the pediatric population, especially in this subgroup of lesions. Here we present our experience treating grade III AVMs by curative embolization in pediatric patients. METHODS: Clinical and angiographic data from pediatric patients with grade III SM AVMs were retrospectively collected between 2011 and 2020 in a referral institution. We grouped the AVMs into subtypes according to size (S), venous drainage (V), and eloquence (E) and obtained subtypes: IIIA (S1V1E1), IIIB (S2V1E0), IIIC (S2V0E1), and IIID (S3V0E0). RESULTS: A total of 61 embolization sessions were performed in 35 pediatric patients. There were 25 females (64%), and the mean age was 12.2 years (range 5-18). Complete angiographic occlusion was achieved in 16 patients (47%). In 13 patients (37%), the AVM was occluded with a single embolization session and most (12/13) had small lesions (IIIA subtype). Among the 19 patients with incomplete occlusion, most (58%) had large lesions (IIIB, IIIC, and IIID). Large AVMs (IIIB, IIIC, and IIID) underwent 36 sessions; however, only 3 patients (21%) achieved complete occlusion in 11 sessions. Eight intraoperative complications (13% procedures) occurred mainly in ruptured AVMs (7/8) and eloquent zones (7/8). CONCLUSIONS: Curative embolization for SM grade III AVMs in children carries a high complication rate, especially in small, ruptured, and eloquent lesions.

Embolization has the potential to enhance the safety and efficacy of AVM treatment when applied in carefully considered cases. The utility of embolization, at the present time, is limited by the fact that the procedure may be associated with disabling or fatal complications, and because complete or near-complete AVM nidus occlusion can be achieved only in a minority of cases. Because of these factors, embolization should not be considered a ""standard-of-care"" for the management of all cerebral AVMs, and careful case selection for embolization, with well-defined treatment goals in mind, is essential. Finally, not all AVMs that can be embolized should be embolized.",2000,2000,Clinical neurosurgery,46,,295-318,eng,False,,Evaluation Study;Journal Article;Review,"Cerebral Hemorrhage/prevention & control/therapy;*Embolization, Therapeutic;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery/*therapy;Intraoperative Complications/therapy;Microsurgery;Radiosurgery",
25015197,Planning evaluation of C-arm cone beam CT angiography for target delineation in stereotactic radiation surgery of brain arteriovenous malformations.,"PURPOSE: Stereotactic radiation surgery (SRS) is one of the therapeutic modalities currently available to treat cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM). Conventionally, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MR angiography (MRA) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) are used in combination to identify the target volume for SRS treatment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of C-arm cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) in the treatment planning of SRS for cerebral AVMs. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixteen consecutive patients treated for brain AVMs at our institution were included in this retrospective study. Prior to treatment, all patients underwent MRA, DSA, and C-arm CBCT. All images were coregistered using the GammaPlan planning system. AVM regions were delineated independently by 2 physicians using either C-arm CBCT or MRA, resulting in 2 volumes: a CBCT volume (VCBCT) and an MRA volume (VMRA). SRS plans were generated based on the delineated regions. RESULTS: The average volume of treatment targets delineated using C-arm CBCT and MRA were similar, 6.40 cm(3) and 6.98 cm(3), respectively (P=.82). However, significant regions of nonoverlap existed. On average, the overlap of the MRA with the C-arm CBCT was only 52.8% of the total volume. In most cases, radiation plans based on VMRA did not provide adequate dose to the region identified on C-arm CBCT; the mean minimum dose to VCBCT was 29.5%, whereas the intended goal was 45% (P<.001). The mean volume of normal brain receiving 12 Gy or more in C-arm CBCT-based plans was not greater than in the MRA-based plans. CONCLUSIONS: Use of C-arm CBCT images significantly alters the delineated regions of AVMs for SRS planning, compared to that of MRA/MRI images. CT-based planning can be accomplished without increasing the dose to normal brain and may represent a more accurate definition of the nidus, increasing the chances for successful obliteration.",2014 Oct 1,2014,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",90,2,430-7,eng,False,S0360-3016(14)00684-1;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2014.05.035;S0360-3016(14)00684-1;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2014.05.035,Comparative Study;Journal Article,"Angiography, Digital Subtraction/*methods;Cerebral Angiography/*methods;Cone-Beam Computed Tomography/*methods;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/*diagnostic imaging/*surgery;*Magnetic Resonance Angiography;*Radiosurgery;Radiotherapy Dosage",
35901715,Hemodynamic changes during the obliteration process for cerebral arteriovenous malformations after radiosurgery.,"OBJECTIVE: The process of cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) obliteration following radiosurgery is poorly understood. Authors of this retrospective study aimed to assess the changes in AVM hemodynamics after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) by using 3D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to elucidate the process of AVM obliteration. METHODS: Twenty-four patients with AVMs treated with SRS between July 2015 and December 2017 were included in this study and classified into two groups depending on the duration of AVM obliteration: group A, obliteration within 3 years (n = 15); and group B, obliteration taking more than 3 years or no obliteration (n = 9). Blood flow (ml/min) in the largest feeding artery was measured before and after SRS by using time-averaged 3D flow MRI. The decreasing rate of blood flow in the feeding artery after SRS was calculated as the percent change from baseline blood flow. A Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare the decreasing blood flow rate between the two groups at 4 and 12 months after SRS. RESULTS: For the entire cohort, the mean decrease in blood flow in the feeding artery from baseline was 29% at 4 months and 71% at 12 months after SRS. In general, blood flow after SRS decreased faster in group A and slower in group B. The decreasing rates in blood flow at 4 and 12 months after SRS were significantly different between the two groups (p = 0.02 and < 0.001, respectively).

29772363,"A Comprehensive Study of Symptomatic Late Radiation-Induced Complications After Radiosurgery for Brain Arteriovenous Malformation: Incidence, Risk Factors, and Clinical Outcomes.","OBJECTIVE: Stereotactic radiosurgery is widely used to treat brain arteriovenous malformation; however, detailed information on late radiation-induced complications (LRICs) is scarce. The goal of the present study was to characterize the incidence, risk factors, and clinical outcomes of LRICs based on our long-term follow-up data. METHODS: The outcomes of consecutive patients who underwent stereotactic radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations at our institution in 1990-2010 were analyzed. Cyst formation/encapsulated hematoma (CF/EH) and radiation-induced tumor were defined as LRICs. Cumulative incidence rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Risk factors for CF/EH were analyzed using a Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS: A total of 581 patients with mean and median follow-up periods of 11.8 and 10.1 years, respectively (range, 2.0-26.7 years), were analyzed. CF/EH was observed in 30 patients (5.2%). The median time to progression was 11.8 years (range, 1.9-23.9 years). Cumulative incidence rates were 0.8%, 2.8%, 7.6%, and 9.7% at 5, 10, 15, and 20 years, respectively. A multivariate analysis showed that lobar location and maximal diameter ≥22 mm were significant risk factors for CF/EH. Overall, the functional outcomes were mild, moderate, and severe/fatal in 26 (87%), 1 (3%), and 3 (10%) patients, respectively. Radiation-induced tumor was confirmed in only 1 patient (0.17%).

27081906,Stereotactic radiosurgery for Spetzler-Martin Grade III arteriovenous malformations: an international multicenter study.,"OBJECTIVE Because of the angioarchitectural diversity of Spetzler-Martin (SM) Grade III arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), the management of these lesions is incompletely defined. The aims of this multicenter, retrospective cohort study were to evaluate the outcomes after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for SM Grade III AVMs and to determine the factors predicting these outcomes. METHODS The authors analyzed and pooled data from patients with SM Grade III AVMs treated with SRS at 8 institutions participating in the International Gamma Knife Research Foundation. Patients with these AVMs and a minimum follow-up length of 12 months were included in the study cohort. An optimal outcome was defined as AVM obliteration, no post-SRS hemorrhage, and no permanently symptomatic radiation-induced changes (RICs). Data were analyzed by univariate and multivariate regression analyses. RESULTS The SM Grade III AVM cohort comprised 891 patients with a mean age of 34 years at the time of SRS. The mean nidus volume, radiosurgical margin dose, and follow-up length were 4.5 cm(3), 20 Gy, and 89 months, respectively. The actuarial obliteration rates at 5 and 10 years were 63% and 78%, respectively. The annual postradiosurgery hemorrhage rate was 1.2%. Symptomatic and permanent RICs were observed in 11% and 4% of the patients, respectively. Optimal outcome was achieved in 56% of the patients and was significantly more frequent in cases of unruptured AVMs (OR 2.3, p < 0.001). The lack of a previous hemorrhage (p = 0.037), absence of previous AVM embolization (p = 0.002), smaller nidus volume (p = 0.014), absence of AVM-associated arterial aneurysms (p = 0.023), and higher margin dose (p < 0.001) were statistically significant independent predictors of optimal outcome in a multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS Stereotactic radiosurgery provided better outcomes for patients with small, unruptured SM Grade III AVMs than for large or ruptured SM Grade III nidi. A prospective trial or registry that facilitates a comparison of SRS with conservative AVM management might further clarify the authors' observations for these often high-risk AVMs.",2017 Mar,2017,Journal of neurosurgery,126,3,859-871,eng,True,10.3171/2016.1.JNS152564;10.3171/2016.1.JNS152564,Journal Article;Multicenter Study,"Adult;Cerebral Hemorrhage/diagnosis/radiotherapy;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/*radiotherapy;Male;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Rupture, Spontaneous/diagnosis/radiotherapy;Severity of Illness Index;Treatment Outcome",ARUBA = A Randomized Trial of Unruptured Brain AVMs;AVM = arteriovenous malformation;EBRT = external-beam radiation therapy;Gamma Knife;RBAS = radiosurgery-based AVM score;RIC = radiation-induced change;SAIVM = Scottish Audit of Intracranial Vascular Malformations;SM = Spetzler-Martin;SRS = stereotactic radiosurgery;Spetzler-Martin Grade III;VRAS = Virginia Radiosurgery AVM Scale;intracranial arteriovenous malformation;intracranial hemorrhages;radiosurgery;stereotactic radiosurgery;vascular disorders;vascular malformations
21743357,Repeat radiosurgery for intracranial arteriovenous malformations.,"BACKGROUND: Despite a high success rate in the stereotactic radiosurgical treatment of intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) that cannot be safely resected with microsurgery, some patients must be managed after treatment failure. OBJECTIVE: To provide an update on the use of repeat linear accelerator radiosurgery as a treatment for failed AVM radiosurgery at the University of Florida. METHODS: We reviewed 103 patients who underwent repeat radiosurgical treatment for residual AVM at the University of Florida between December 1991 and December 2007. Each of these patients had at least 2 radiosurgical treatments for the same AVM. Patient information, including AVM nidus volume, prescription dose, age, and sex, was collected at the time of initial treatment and again at the time of retreatment. Patients were followed up after treatment with magnetic resonance, computed tomography, and angiographic imaging at standard intervals to determine the status of their AVM. The median follow-up after retreatment was 31 months. RESULTS: Between the first and second treatments, the median AVM nidus volume was decreased by 69% (from a median volume of 12.7 to 4.0 cm), allowing the median prescribed dose to be increased from 1500 cGy on initial treatment to 1750 cGy on retreatment. The final obliteration rate on retreatment was 65.3%. After salvage retreatment, 5 patients (4.9%) experienced radiation-induced complications, and 6 patients (5.8%) experienced posttreatment hemorrhage.

26078359,Arteriovenous malformation embocure score: AVMES.,"BACKGROUND: Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (CAVMs) may be treated with microsurgery, radiosurgery, endovascular surgery, or a combination of these modalities. Grading scales are available to aid the assessment of curative risk for microsurgery and radiosurgery. No grading system has been developed to assess the curative risk of endovascular surgery. OBJECTIVE: To report our retrospective application of the AVM embocure score to patients treated at our institution between 2005 and 2011 METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 39 patients with CAVM treated at our institution between 2005 and 2011 with the primary aim of achieving a curative embolization. After reviewing all the different variables associated with the conventional Onyx embolization technique for CAVMs, we identified the following as the most relevant characteristics influencing the chances for complete angiographic embolization and complication risk: the number of arterial pedicles and draining veins, size of AVM nidus, and vascular eloquence. We sought to develop a scoring system to assess the complication risk for a curative embolization of CAVM with liquid embolic Onyx (Covidien, Irvine, California, USA). We developed the AVM embocure score (AVMES). This scoring system ranges from 3 to 10 and is the arithmetic sum of the number of arterial pedicles feeding the AVM (≤3, 4-6, >6), the number of draining veins (≤3, 4-6, >6), the size of the AVM nidus in centimeters (≤3, 4-6, >6), and the vascular eloquence (0-1). We applied AVMES to the same cohort of patients and validated the predictability of complete angiographic embolization and expected clinical risk of complication. RESULTS: In lesions with an AVMES of 3 (n=8), there was a 100% rate of complete AVM obliteration and 0% rate of major complications. In AVMES 4 (n=12) lesions, there was 75% complete obliteration rate, with 8% major morbidity. In AVMES 5 (n=9) lesions, there was 78% complete obliteration and 11% major morbidity. In AVMES >5 (n=10) there was 20% complete obliteration and 30% major morbidity. Receiver-operator curve analysis showed that this scoring system was robust in its discriminative ability, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.8356 for complete obliteration without complication, AUC=0.8240 for complete obliteration regardless of the presence of major morbidity, and AUC=0.7529 for major morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: The AVMES complements existing scoring systems for microsurgery and radiosurgery. It provides a valuable tool for risk assessment during the complex decision-making process in treating AVMs that accounts for angioarchitectural features of particular relevance to endovascular surgeons.",2016 Jul,2016,Journal of neurointerventional surgery,8,7,685-91,eng,False,10.1136/neurintsurg-2015-011779;neurintsurg-2015-011779;10.1136/neurintsurg-2015-011779,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Angiography/methods;Child;Child, Preschool;Embolization, Therapeutic/methods;Female;Humans;Infant;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnostic imaging/*therapy;Male;Microsurgery/methods;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/methods;Retrospective Studies;Risk Assessment/methods;*Severity of Illness Index;Treatment Outcome",Arteriovenous Malformation;Embolic
17538373,Arteriovenous malformations after Leksell gamma knife radiosurgery: rate of obliteration and complications.,"OBJECTIVE: Although relevant information exists regarding the chance of obliterating arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) using radiosurgery, the overall chance of cure after gamma knife radiosurgery is usually only extrapolated from a portion of all monitored patients. This chance and the risks involved in radiosurgery, including repeat treatment when necessary in a defined population of treated patients, were analyzed in our study. METHODS: Between October 1992 and June 2000, gamma knife radiosurgery was performed on 330 patients with AVMs. The volume of the AVM nidus ranged from 0.15 to 28.6 cm (median, 3.9 cm). When complete obliteration was not achieved within 3 years, repeat radiosurgery was performed on 76 patients. The volume of the nidus for the second treatment ranged from 0.09 to 16.8 cm (median 2.9 cm). The result was reviewed in 300 (91%) patients after the first round of treatment and in 68 (89.5%) after the second round of treatment. RESULTS: AVM obliteration was achieved in 222 (74%) patients after the first round of radiosurgery and in 47 (69%) after the second. The overall chance of cure was 92% (269 patients). Final angiography verified complete obliteration by 12 to 96 months (median, 25 mo) after initial radiosurgery. Smaller volume AVMs and the application of a higher radiation dose resulted in a higher chance of obliteration. The risk of rebleeding after radiosurgery was 2.1% annually until full obliteration, and the overall mortality from rebleeding was 1%. The risk of permanent morbidity after the first and second radiosurgery treatments were 2.7 and 2.9%, respectively. The cumulative risk of morbidity in both groups of patients was 3.4%. CONCLUSION: Although one-quarter of the patients required that the treatment be repeated, gamma knife radiosurgery can offer a high cure rate for patients treated for AVMs with a low risk of morbidity and mortality from rebleeding during the latent period.",2007 Jun,2007,Neurosurgery,60,6,1005-14; discussion 1015-6,eng,True,00006123-200706000-00005;10.1227/01.NEU.0000255474.60505.4A,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/pathology/*surgery;Intracranial Hemorrhages/*etiology;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects;Reoperation;Retrospective Studies;Risk Assessment;Time Factors;Treatment Outcome",
10725624,Development of a model to predict permanent symptomatic postradiosurgery injury for arteriovenous malformation patients. Arteriovenous Malformation Radiosurgery Study Group.,"PURPOSE: To better predict permanent complications from arteriovenous malformation (AVM) radiosurgery. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Data from 85 AVM patients who developed symptomatic complications following gamma knife radiosurgery and 337 control patients with no complications were evaluated as part of a multi-institutional study. Of the 85 patients with complications, 38 patients were classified as having permanent symptomatic sequelae (necrosis). AVM marginal doses varied from 10-35 Gy and treatment volumes from 0.26-47.9 cc. Median follow-up for patients without complications was 45 months (range: 24-92). RESULTS: Multivariate analysis of the effects of AVM location and the volume of tissue receiving 12 Gy or more (12-Gy-Volume) allowed construction of a significant postradiosurgery injury expression (SPIE) score. AVM locations in order of increasing risk and SPIE score (from 0-10) were: frontal, temporal, intraventricular, parietal, cerebellar, corpus callosum, occipital, medulla, thalamus, basal ganglia, and pons/midbrain. The final statistical model predicts risks of permanent symptomatic sequelae from SPIE scores and 12-Gy-Volumes. Prior hemorrhage, marginal dose, and Marginal-12-Gy-Volume (target volume excluded) did not significantly improve the risk-prediction model for permanent sequelae (p >/= 0.39). CONCLUSION: The risks of developing permanent symptomatic sequelae from AVM radiosurgery vary dramatically with location and, to a lesser extent, volume. These risks can be predicted according to the SPIE location-risk score and the 12-Gy-Volume.",2000 Mar 15,2000,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",46,5,1143-8,eng,False,S0360301699005131;10.1016/s0360-3016(99)00513-1,Journal Article;Multicenter Study,"Case-Control Studies;Follow-Up Studies;Forecasting;Humans;*Injury Severity Score;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/pathology/*surgery;Logistic Models;*Models, Biological;Multivariate Analysis;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects;Radiotherapy Dosage;Risk Assessment;Risk Factors",
39094935,Microsurgery of Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformations in a Resource-Limited Setting: The First Case-Series from Iraq.,"BACKGROUND: Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) can lead to significant morbidity and are particularly challenging to manage in resource-limited settings where endovascular treatment modalities are unaffordable for most patients. OBJECTIVE: To describe the first case series of AVM from Iraq with an analysis of the related clinicoradiologic characteristics, operative features, and outcomes. METHODS: A single-center database from October 2018 to December 2022 was reviewed to analyze the characteristics of cerebral AVMs who underwent surgical treatment in Baghdad, Iraq. We collected patient demographics, clinical, radiologic, operative, and the follow-up combined outcome results (modified Rankin Scale score and the presence of AVM remnants). RESULTS: Of the 54 AVM patients treated with microsurgery, the majority of lesions have Spetzler-Martin grade of 3 (31.5%), followed by grade 1 (29.6%). The parietal lobe was the most common location of AVM in 25.9% of the cases, and the temporal location had better outcomes. The mean duration of surgery was 8.5 hours, ranging from 3 to 14 hours, with 20.3% of cases having undergone preoperative stereotactic radiosurgery, and just one patient received preoperative embolization. Good combined outcome (modified Rankin Scale 0-2 and no AVM remnant) was associated with lower SM grades (P=0.003); location in the nondominant hemisphere (P=0.036), and noneloquent regions (P=0.006); absence of deep venous drainage (P=0.042) and no intraoperative brain swelling (P=0.004). The mortality rate in our series was 5.5%.

39227482,Evaluation of micro-remnant niduses of arteriovenous malformations post-gamma knife radiosurgery by 3D-rotational angiography.,"PURPOSE: Recent innovations in radiological imaging have enabled the detection of micro-remnant niduses of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) after gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS), which have not been previously perceptible. Herein, we focus on the difficulty of evaluating micro-remnant AVMs after GKS that are hardly perceptible on conventional examinations and propose integrating follow-up three-dimensional rotational angiography (3D-RA) in the previous gamma plan as a solution. METHODS: We retrospectively searched NTT Medical Center Tokyo hospital database for patients with AVMs who underwent both two-dimensional digital subtraction angiography (2D-DSA) and 3D-RA as follow-up for GKS from February 2021 to January 2024. Patients with suspected nidus occlusion on the latest non-contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (NC-MRA) were included, and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA), 2D-DSA, and 3D-RA were evaluated. RESULTS: Twelve patients with 13 AVM sites were defined as having complete nidus occlusion on upfront NC-MRA. On 2D-DSA, seven AVM sites showed the presence of slight remaining AVMs based on the detection of remnant drainage veins, however the nidus was not detected in three cases. Nevertheless, 3D-RA detected micro-remnant niduses in all seven AVM sites, and four patients underwent re-GKS. Nine patients with ten AVM sites also underwent CE-MRA, and six AVM sites were diagnosed with radiation-induced parenchymal injury. CONCLUSION: Importing the 3D-RA image into the treatment planning has the potential to be more helpful than NC-MRA or CE-MRA to detect micro-remnant AVMs and evaluate the true remnant volume, and may contribute to a more detailed treatment planning, thereby improving the results of GKS retreatment.",2024 Sep 3,2024,Acta neurochirurgica,166,1,359,eng,False,10.1007/s00701-024-06246-0;10.1007/s00701-024-06246-0;10.1007/s00701-024-06246-0,Journal Article,"Humans;*Radiosurgery/methods;Male;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery/diagnostic imaging;Female;Adult;Middle Aged;Retrospective Studies;*Imaging, Three-Dimensional/methods;*Angiography, Digital Subtraction/methods;Aged;*Magnetic Resonance Angiography/methods;Cerebral Angiography/methods;Young Adult",Gamma knife;Radiation-induced parenchymal injury;Remnant micro-arteriovenous malformations;Retreatment;Three-dimensional rotational angiography
28017742,Embolization Followed by Radiosurgery for the Treatment of Brain Arteriovenous Malformations (AVMs).,"BACKGROUND: Embolization has been proposed to reduce the size of the arteriovenous malformation (AVM) nidus in advance of radiosurgical treatment. Embolization followed by radiosurgery for brain AVMs, however, is controversial. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the impact of embolization on nidal size before radiosurgical treatment and evaluated cure rates and complications by using embolization followed by radiosurgery. METHODS: A retrospective review of our institutional AVM database identified 91 patients treated from 1995 to 2009 with embolization followed by radiosurgery. Pre- and postembolization AVM volumes were measured with angiography, and the modified radiation-based AVM scores (RBAS) also were calculated pre- and postembolization. RBAS determined from pre-embolization volumes were correlated with postradiosurgical obliteration. RESULTS: Median AVM volume declined from 18.8 mL (interquartile range, 10.2-32.2 mL) to 9.9 mL (3.1-19.2 mL) after embolization, P < 0.00003. Median RBAS scores decreased from 2.6 mL (1.8-3.9 mL) to 1.8 mL (1.0-2.8 mL), P < 0.00003. Two of 91 (2.2%) had new fixed deficits after embolization; however, no patient had new disabling deficits (modified Rankin Scale score >2). A total of 71 of 91 (79%) have had >3 years' follow-up, and 40 (56%) had complete obliteration, with 38 (53%) having excellent outcomes (complete obliteration without neurologic decline). Excellent outcome was seen in 90% of patients with modified RBAS score <1, 66% of patients with score 1-1.5, 50% patients with score 1.5-2, and 43% of patients with score >2. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that embolization of brain AVMs can safely and effectively reduce the treatment volume before radiosurgery.

METHODS: The present series included 39 children (3-17 years of age) who underwent GKS for cerebral AVMs between January 2002 and February 2008. Twenty-five patients presented with hemorrhages. The median AVM volume was 1.5 cm³, and the median marginal dose was 20 Gy. All patients continued to have follow-up for more than 24 months with serial magnetic resonance images (MRIs)/angiograms. Current school performance has been evaluated using a telephone survey answered by the patients' parents. RESULTS: Follow-up angiograms, available in 34 patients, confirmed complete obliteration in 16 patients. Serial MRIs indicated obliteration of the nidus in one of five patients without angiography. The diffuse nidus structure and low marginal dose were significantly associated with incomplete obliteration. Twelve patients underwent a second GKS, and subsequent angiographies, available in six patients, demonstrated complete obliteration in two of them. Complications included new-onset seizures (n = 1), apraxia (n = 1), and temporal horn entrapment requiring a shunt operation (n = 1). School performance declined in 14 out of 32 patients. Both the AVM volume and modified AVM score were found to be reliable predictors of school performance. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study substantiate the diffuse and other atypical features of pediatric AVMs as major determinants of treatment failure following GKS.

23842554,Impact on seizure control of surgical resection or radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"BACKGROUND: Seizures are a common presenting symptom of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). However, the impact of treatment modality on seizure control remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To compare seizure control after surgical resection or radiosurgery for AVMs. METHODS: We analyzed retrospectively collected information for 378 patients with cerebral AVMs treated at our institution from 1990 to 2010. The application of strict inclusion criteria resulted in a study population of 164 patients. RESULTS: In our cohort, 31 patients (20.7%) had Spetzler-Martin grade I AVMs, 51 (34.0%) grade II, 47 (31.3%) grade III, 20 (13.3%) grade IV, and 1 (0.7%) grade V. Of the 49 patients (30%) presenting with seizures, 60.4% experienced seizure persistence after treatment. For these patients, radiosurgery was associated with seizure recurrence (odds ratio: 4.32, 95% confidence interval: 1.24-15.02, P = .021). AVM obliteration was predictive of seizure freedom at last follow-up (P = .002). In contrast, for patients presenting without seizures, 18.4% experienced de novo seizures after treatment, for which surgical resection was identified as an independent risk factor (hazard ratio: 8.65, 95% confidence interval: 3.05-24.5, P < .001). CONCLUSION: Although our data suggest that achieving seizure freedom should not be the primary goal of AVM treatment, surgical resection may result in improved seizure control compared with radiosurgery for patients who present with seizures. Conversely, in patients without presenting seizures, surgical resection increases the risk of new-onset seizures compared with radiosurgery, but primarily within the early posttreatment period. Surgical resection and radiosurgery result in divergent seizure control rates depending on seizure presentation.",2013 Oct,2013,Neurosurgery,73,4,648-55; discussion 655-6,eng,False,10.1227/NEU.0000000000000071;10.1227/NEU.0000000000000071,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/surgery;Male;Middle Aged;*Neurosurgical Procedures/adverse effects;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects;Retrospective Studies;Seizures/*etiology/*surgery;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",
30474715,Radiosurgical treatment of arteriovenous malformations in a retrospective study group of 33 children: the importance of radiobiological scores.,"PURPOSE: Arteriovenous malformations' (AVMs) obliteration depends on several factors; among the many factors that must be considered to obtain a high rate of obliteration and a low rate of complications, Flickinger-Pollock Score (FPS) seems to have an important role but still have to be validated in the pediatric population while Paddick-Conformity Index (PCI) still has no demonstration of its utility on the outcome and is considered only as a treatment quality marker. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 33 consecutive children (2-18 years) with an AVM, treated with stereotactic radiosurgery Gamma Knife (SRS-GK) from 2001 to 2014 in our institution. We assess angiographic (DSA) Obliteration Rate (OR) as well FPS and PCI to draw conclusions. RESULTS: DSA-OR was 60.6% with a rate of hemorrhage of 0%. median target volume (TV) was 3.60 cc (mean 4.32 ± 3.63; range 0.15-14.2), median PD was 22 Gy (mean 21.4 ± 2.6; range 16.5-25). Median percentage of coverage was 98% (mean 97 ± 3; range 84-100). The median modified FPS was 0.78 (mean 0.89 ± 0.52; range 0.21-2.1) and highly correlate with OR (p = 0.01). The median PCI was 0.65 (mean 0.65 ± 0.14; range 0.34-0.95) A PCI lower than 0.57 highly correlates with final OR (p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: SRS-GK was safe and gradually effective in children. A prescription dose-like that used in adult population (i.e. > 18 and between 20 and 25 Gy) is essential to achieve obliteration. A PD of 23 Gy and 22 Gy did impact OR, respectively (p = 0.02) and (p = 0.05). FPS and PCI are valuable scores that seem to correlate with the OR also in the pediatric population although further prospective studies are needed to confirm these observations.",2019 Feb,2019,Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for,35,2,301-308,eng,False,10.1007/s00381-018-4008-2;10.1007/s00381-018-4008-2;10.1007/s00381-018-4008-2,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Arteriovenous Fistula/pathology/*radiotherapy;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/pathology/*radiotherapy;Male;Radiosurgery/*methods;Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted/*methods;Retrospective Studies",Children;Gamma knife;Pediatric brain malformations;Pediatric radiosurgery
37462811,Evolution of clinical and translational advances in the management of pediatric arteriovenous malformations.,"Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) represent one of the most challenging diagnoses in pediatric neurosurgery. Until recently, the majority of AVMs was only identified after hemorrhage and primarily treated with surgery.

33409615,Management of haemorrhagic stroke secondary to arteriovenous malformations in childhood.,"AIMS: The aim of this study is to describe the outcome and management of all children who have presented with haemorrhagic stroke (HS) secondary to an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) at a single UK centre over a 13-year period. METHODS: All children with HS managed at our institution (2005-2018) were identified and those with underlying AVMs were studied. Clinical and imaging data were obtained from medical records. Outcome was scored using the Recovery and Recurrence Questionnaire. RESULTS: Ninety-three children (median age 8.8 years; 56 males; 8 neonates) presented with both global and focal features (28 had Glasgow Coma Score < 8). Haemorrhage was intraparenchymal in 72; prior risk factors present in 14. An underlying vascular lesion was identified in 68/93, most commonly AVM (n = 48). A systemic cause was found in 10, cerebral venous thrombosis in three, and 9 remain unidentified despite neuroradiological investigation. Median follow-up was 2.4 years, six died, and one was lost to follow-up. Outcome was rated as good in 60/86. Of the 48 AVMs, 3 were Spetzler-Martin (SM) grade 1, 21 SM 2, 21 SM3 and 3 SM4. One patient was treated conservatively as the AVM was too high risk to treat. At follow-up, 19 with AVM were angiographically cured, all with low SM grade and with the use of a single modality in 9 cases (all low SM grade). CONCLUSION: Although children with acute HS are extremely unwell at presentation, supportive care results in a good outcome in the majority.

12380486,Development of a posterior fossa cavernous malformation associated with bilateral venous anomalies: case report.,"Venous angiomas (VAs) and cavernous malformations (CMs) are common cerebrovascular malformations. Frequently, these lesions are found in close proximity. The interrelationship between VAs and CMs has not yet been adequately defined. The authors report a case of a 48-year-old man with progressive dysarthria, dysmetria, and ataxia. Eight years previously, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a solitary CM and bilateral posterior fossa VAs. Later imaging after neurological progression revealed the presence of 2 rather than 1 CM adjacent to the VAs. The sequential imaging suggests a causal relationship between VAs and some CMs. Furthermore, the detailed MRI permitted radiosurgical treatment of these CMs. The occurrence of de novo CMs adjacent to VAs on future imaging studies in other patients may help confirm the etiology of at least a subset of CMs.",2002 Oct,2002,Journal of neuroimaging : official journal of the American Society of,12,4,371-3,eng,False,10.1111/j.1552-6569.2002.tb00147.x,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Cranial Fossa, Posterior;Hemangioma, Cavernous/*diagnosis/etiology/surgery;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/*diagnosis/surgery;*Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/instrumentation",

25119001,Unyielding progress: recent advances in the treatment of central nervous system neoplasms with radiosurgery and radiation therapy.,"In the past decade, our understanding of the roles of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in the management of brain tumors has dramatically improved. To highlight the changes and contemporary treatment approaches, we review the indications and outcomes of ionizing radiation for benign intracranial tumors and brain metastases. For nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas, SRS is able to achieve radiographic tumor control in at least 90 % of cases. The rate of SRS-induced endocrine remission for functioning pituitary adenomas depends on the tumor subtype, but it is generally lower than the rate of radiographic tumor control. The most common complications from pituitary adenoma SRS treatment are hypopituitarism and cranial neuropathies. SRS has become the preferred treatment modality for vestibular schwannomas and skull base meningiomas less than 3 cm in size. Large vestibular schwannomas and meningiomas remain best managed with initial surgical resection or EBRT for surgically ineligible patients. For small to moderately sized brain metastases, there has been a shift toward treatment of newly diagnosed patients with SRS alone due to similar local control rates compared with surgical resection. RCTs have shown combined SRS and whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) for brain metastases to decrease rates of local and distant intracranial recurrence compared to SRS alone. However, the improved intracranial control comes at the expense of poorer neurocognitive outcomes and without prolonging overall survival. Therefore, WBRT is generally reserved for salvage therapy. While EBRT has been frequently supplanted by SRS for the treatment pituitary adenomas and brain metastases, it still proves useful in selected cases of large lesions which are not amenable to surgical debulking or for those with widespread disease, poor performance status, and short life expectancy. In recent years, the scope of SRS has extended beyond the intracranial space to include extradural and intradural spinal tumors.",2014 Sep,2014,Journal of neuro-oncology,119,3,513-29,eng,False,10.1007/s11060-014-1501-7;10.1007/s11060-014-1501-7,Journal Article;Review,Brain Neoplasms/*radiotherapy/*surgery;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/radiotherapy/surgery;Radiosurgery;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic,

Nidus volume was quantified on dynamic MR angiography. Total arterial cerebral blood flow (tCBF), venous outflow as well as aqueductal and craniospinal stroke volumes were obtained using velocity-encoded cine-phase contrast MRI. Intracranial volume change during the cardiac cycle was calculated and intracranial pressure (ICP) was derived from systolic intracranial volume change (ICVC) and pulse pressure gradient. RESULTS: TCBF was significantly higher in AVM patients as compared to healthy controls (median 799 vs. 692 mL/min, p=0.007). There was a trend for venous flow to be increased in both the ipsilateral internal jugular vein (IJV, 282 vs. 225 mL/min, p=0.16), and in the contralateral IJV (322 vs. 285 mL/min, p=0.09), but not in secondary veins. There was no significant difference in median ICP between AVM patients and control subjects (6.9 vs. 8.6 mmHg, p=0.30) and ICP did not correlate with nidus volume in AVM patients (ρ=-0.06, p=0.74). There was a significant positive correlation between tCBF and craniospinal CSF stroke volume (ρ=0.69, p=0.02).

16220210,Three-dimensional dynamic magnetic resonance angiography for the evaluation of radiosurgically treated cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"We assessed the value of three-dimensional (3D) dynamic magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) for the follow-up of patients with radiosurgically treated cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Fifty-four patients with cerebral AVMs treated by radiosurgery (RS) were monitored using conventional catheter angiography (CCA) and 3D dynamic MRA with sensitivity encoding based on the parallel imaging. Cerebral AVM was qualitatively classified by two radiologists into one of five categories in terms of residual nidus size and persistence of early draining vein (I, >6 cm; II, 3-6 cm; III, <3 cm; IV, isolated early draining vein; V, complete obliteration). 3D MRA findings showed a good agreement with CCA in 40 cases (kappa=0.62). Of 23 nidus detected on CCA, 3D dynamic MRA showed 14 residual nidus. Of 28 occluded nidus on 3D dynamic MRA, 22 nidus were occluded on CCA. The sensitivity and specificity of 3D dynamic MRA for the detection of residual AVM were 81% and 100%. 3D dynamic MRA after RS may therefore be useful in association with MRI and can be repeated as long as opacification of the nidus or early venous drainage persists, one CCA remaining indispensable to affirm the complete occlusion at the end of follow-up.",2006 Mar,2006,European radiology,16,3,583-91,eng,False,10.1007/s00330-005-0011-6,Journal Article,"Adult;Aged;Cerebral Angiography;Female;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;*Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*pathology/surgery;Magnetic Resonance Angiography/*methods;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery;Sensitivity and Specificity",
35785660,Impact of neurovascular comorbidities and complications on outcomes after procedural management of arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVE: Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are complex vascular lesions at perpetual risk for rupture, which can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. This study sought to evaluate the dynamic relationship between comorbidities and post-procedure complications to quantify the risk of poor discharge outcomes to create a predictive outcomes model. METHODS: The National Inpatient Sample (NIS) data from 2012 to 2015 was queried for AVM treatment using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes. The Neurovascular Comorbidities Index (NCI) quantified patient comorbidity burden. In-hospital complications included surgical and medical complications or seizures. The primary outcome was the NIS Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Outcome Measure (NIS-SOM). RESULTS: A total of 1363 patients were included. A total of 1330 patients (98%) underwent embolization, 28 (2%) underwent resection, and 9 (0.7%) underwent radiosurgery. A higher NCI was associated with the occurrence of any complication (odds ratio [OR], 1.30 if NCI = 2; P &lt; 0.001). Higher NCI was also significantly associated with a poor NIS-SOM outcome (OR, 2.45 if NCI = 2 and no complications; P &lt; 0.001). A ruptured AVM with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) increased the risk of in-hospital complications (OR, 2.16; P = 0.007) and a poor NIS-SOM outcome (OR, 3.18; P &lt; 0.001). Various hypothetical patient scenarios and the predicted outcomes are also presented. CONCLUSION: Neurovascular comorbidities have a significant impact on poor functional outcomes at discharge in patients with and without complications following procedural management of AVMs. At the time of initial patient assessment, risk stratification strategies should take into account neurovascular comorbidities and potential complications. Such an approach would ultimately optimize patient outcomes and increase the value of care provided.",2022 Sep,2022,Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,220,,107349,eng,False,S0303-8467(22)00230-X;10.1016/j.clineuro.2022.107349;S0303-8467(22)00230-X;10.1016/j.clineuro.2022.107349,Journal Article,"Comorbidity;*Embolization, Therapeutic;Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/surgery;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;*Subarachnoid Hemorrhage/surgery;Treatment Outcome",AVM;Comorbidities;Complications;NIS;Outcomes

Efforts to improve the therapeutic ratio for this indication include use of staged volume procedures and hypofractionation. This study reviews our experience with a cohort of patients treated with hypofractionated radiosurgery. Over a 3year period, 38 patients harboring 39 cerebral AVM were treated with hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy. Seventeen of these patients presented due to hemorrhage, four were asymptomatic unruptured lesions and the remainder were symptomatic unruptured lesions. The median AVM volume was 11.43 cc and median modified Radiosurgery-Based Arteriovenous Malformation Score (mRBAS) was 2.02. The median follow-up was 7.32years. Four patients harboring four AVM were lost to follow-up before a result could be ascertained leaving 35 AVM for analysis. Excellent outcomes (AVM obliteration without new deficits) occurred in 17 of 34 (50%) patients and in 18 of 35 (51%) AVM treated. AVM obliteration was seen in 26 of 35 (74%) lesions treated. Two patients died during the follow-up period (6%). A poor result (major deficit without obliteration) was seen in one patient. Of 19 patients harboring AVM with mRBAS >2.0, an excellent outcome was achieved in eight (42%). Hypofractionation for cerebral AVM can result in satisfactory obliteration rates, but with risk of significant complications commensurate with mRBAS. Further study of this technique will be needed to ascertain the degree of incremental improvement, if any, over other radiosurgery treatment methods.",2016 Jul,2016,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society,29,,155-61,eng,False,S0967-5868(15)00700-6;10.1016/j.jocn.2015.12.006;S0967-5868(15)00700-6;10.1016/j.jocn.2015.12.006,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Cerebral Angiography;Cohort Studies;Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation;Embolization, Therapeutic;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Angiography;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/*methods;Retrospective Studies;Rupture/surgery;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",Arteriovenous malformation;Hypofractionation;LINAC;Radiosurgery
26140495,Volume-staged radiosurgery for large arteriovenous malformations: an evolving paradigm.,"OBJECT Large arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) remain difficult to treat, and ideal treatment parameters for volume-staged stereotactic radiosurgery (VS-SRS) are still unknown. The object of this study was to compare VS-SRS treatment outcomes for AVMs larger than 10 ml during 2 eras; Era 1 was 1992-March 2004, and Era 2 was May 2004-2008. In Era 2 the authors prospectively decreased the AVM treatment volume, increased the radiation dose per stage, and shortened the interval between stages. METHODS All cases of VS-SRS treatment for AVM performed at a single institution were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS Of 69 patients intended for VS-SRS, 63 completed all stages. The median patient age at the first stage of VS-SRS was 34 years (range 9-68 years). The median modified radiosurgery-based AVM score (mRBAS), total AVM volume, and volume per stage in Era 1 versus Era 2 were 3.6 versus 2.7, 27.3 ml versus 18.9 ml, and 15.0 ml versus 6.8 ml, respectively. The median radiation dose per stage was 15.5 Gy in Era 1 and 17.0 Gy in Era 2, and the median clinical follow-up period in living patients was 8.6 years in Era 1 and 4.8 years in Era 2. All outcomes were measured from the first stage of VS-SRS. Near or complete obliteration was more common in Era 2 (log-rank test, p = 0.0003), with 3- and 5-year probabilities of 5% and 21%, respectively, in Era 1 compared with 24% and 68% in Era 2. Radiosurgical dose, AVM volume per stage, total AVM volume, era, compact nidus, Spetzler-Martin grade, and mRBAS were significantly associated with near or complete obliteration on univariate analysis. Dose was a strong predictor of response (Cox proportional hazards, p < 0.001, HR 6.99), with 3- and 5-year probabilities of near or complete obliteration of 5% and 16%, respectively, at a dose < 17 Gy versus 23% and 74% at a dose ≥ 17 Gy. Dose per stage, compact nidus, and total AVM volume remained significant predictors of near or complete obliteration on multivariate analysis. Seventeen patients (25%) had salvage surgery, SRS, and/or embolization. Allowing for salvage therapy, the probability of cure was more common in Era 2 (log-rank test, p = 0.0007) with 5-year probabilities of 0% in Era 1 versus 41% in Era 2. The strong trend toward improved cure in Era 2 persisted on multivariate analysis even when considering mRBAS (Cox proportional hazards, p = 0.055, HR 4.01, 95% CI 0.97-16.59). The complication rate was 29% in Era 1 compared with 13% in Era 2 (Cox proportional hazards, not significant). CONCLUSIONS VS-SRS is an option to obliterate or downsize large AVMs. Decreasing the AVM treatment volume per stage to ≤ 8 ml with this technique allowed a higher dose per fraction and decreased time to response, as well as improved rates of near obliteration and cure without increasing complications. Reducing the volume of these very large lesions can facilitate a surgical approach for cure.",2016 Jan,2016,Journal of neurosurgery,124,1,163-74,eng,False,10.3171/2014.12.JNS141308;10.3171/2014.12.JNS141308,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Child;Embolization, Therapeutic;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/pathology/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Neurosurgical Procedures/*methods;Postoperative Complications/epidemiology;Postoperative Hemorrhage/epidemiology;Radiation Dosage;Radiosurgery/*methods;Retrospective Studies;Salvage Therapy;Survival Analysis;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",ARE = adverse radiation effect;AVM;AVM = arteriovenous malformation;CI = confidence interval;CTCAE V4.0 = Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0;HR = hazard ratio;SM = Spetzler-Martin;SRS;SRS = stereotactic radiosurgery;VRAS = Virginia Radiosurgery AVM Scale;VS = volume staged;mRBAS = modified radiosurgery-based AVM score;radiosurgery;stereotactic radiosurgery;volume-staged radiosurgery
21046174,Onyx embolization for the treatment of brain arteriovenous malformations.,"BACKGROUND: Onyx has emerged in recent years for the endovascular treatment of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). However, the role of Onyx embolization is still under discussion. We report our initial experiences in the treatment of brain AVMs with Onyx embolization. METHODS: Between January 2004 and December 2007, 86 patients with brain AVMs were embolized with Onyx. Clinical presentation included intracerebral hemorrhage in 32 patients, seizures in 25 patients, headaches in 20 patients, neurologic deficits in 3 patients, and in 6 patients the AVM was an incidental finding. According to the Spetzler-Martin scale, three AVMs were grade I, 13 were grade II, 45 were grade III, 19 were grade IV, and 6 were grade V. Seventy-four AVMs were located in eloquent regions. RESULTS: Initial complete obliteration after final embolization was achieved in 16 patients (18.6%), with an average of 80.5% (range, 30-100%) volume reduction. Partial embolization was followed by surgery in 18 patients, whereas 17 AVMs were cured. In 48 patients treated by embolization and radiosurgery, four patients were lost to follow-up. Three-year follow-up angiography was performed on 30 patients and showed complete obliteration after radiosurgery in 23 patients. The remaining 14 patients are awaiting 3-year postradiosurgery results. Embolization-related permanent morbidity was 3.5%, whereas mortality was 1.2%.

The AVMs were Spetzler-Martin grade I in six, grade II in 11, grade III in 12, grade IV in four, and Grade V in four. A total of 69 embolization procedures were performed using estrogen alcohol and polyvinyl acetate as liquid embolization materials. AVM grades improved following embolization in 10 patients. Three hemorrhages occurred several days after the final embolization, probably due to hemodynamic stress on the unoccluded perforating feeders or drainer occlusion. Surgical resection was performed under guidance of intraoperative digital subtraction angiography. Although the AVMs were excised totally in one stage with no major neurological deficits, normal perfusion pressure breakthrough occurred in a patient with prominent collateral circulation of the AVM which developed after the main feeder embolization. Preoperative staged embolization with estrogen alcohol and polyvinyl acetate is effective to expand the surgical indication and to achieve complete resection of difficult AVMs. Direct surgery should be performed as soon as possible if hemodynamic changes are observed following embolization.",2002 Sep,2002,Neurologia medico-chirurgica,42,9,372-8; discussion 379,eng,False,JST.JSTAGE/nmc/42.372;10.2176/nmc.42.372,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Angiography, Digital Subtraction;Cerebral Angiography;Child;Combined Modality Therapy;*Embolization, Therapeutic;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Male;*Microsurgery;Middle Aged;Preoperative Care;Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies",
27057753,Hemorrhage Risk in Pediatric Patients with Multiple Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study aims to characterize the clinical features, treatment strategies, and annual hemorrhage incidence rate of pediatric patients with multiple arteriovenous malformations (MAVM). METHODS: The PubMed and EMBASE databases and the arteriovenous malformations (AVM) database at the Johns Hopkins Hospital were searched for reports of pediatric patients (under 21 years of age) with MAVM. Data related to demographics, clinical features, management, and treatment outcomes were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Twenty-four pediatric patients met the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: The annual hemorrhage incidence rate was 2.1%. The most common presenting features were neurological deficit (38%) and hemorrhage (21%). Treatment with embolization has become the most frequently used modality. In patients undergoing staged treatment of MAVM, hemorrhage of an untreated nidus (n = 1), visualization of a new nidus (n = 2), or disappearance of a draining vein (n = 1) occurred. CONCLUSION: The annual hemorrhage incidence rate for pediatric patients with MAVM approaches the upper range of previously reported hemorrhage rates for solitary AVM. A staged approach to treating MAVM requires close follow-up as changes to the remaining nidi may occur during the latency period.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of endovascular treatment (EVT) as a first-line treatment of SMG III bAVMs. METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective, two-center, observational cohort study. Cases recorded in institutional databases between January 1998 and June 2021 were reviewed. Patients who were ≥ 18 years of age, had ruptured or unruptured SMG III bAVMs, and received EVT as first-line therapy were included. Baseline characteristics of patients and bAVMs, procedure-related complications, clinical outcome according to the modified Rankin Scale, and angiographic follow-up were assessed. The independent risk factors of procedure-related complications and poor clinical outcome were assessed using binary logistic regression. RESULTS: One hundred sixteen patients with 116 SMG III bAVMs were included. The mean age of the patients was 41.9 ± 14.0 years. The most common presentation was hemorrhage (66.4%). Forty-nine (42.2%) bAVMs were found to be completely obliterated by EVT alone at follow-up. Complications occurred in 39 patients (33.6%), including 5 (4.3%) major procedure-related complications. There was no independent predictor of procedure-related complication. Age > 40 years and poor preoperative modified Rankin Scale score were the independent predictors of poor clinical outcome. CONCLUSIONS: EVT of SMG III bAVMs provides encouraging results but needs further improvement. When the embolization procedure performed with intent to cure appears difficult and/or risky, a combined technique (with microsurgery or radiosurgery) may be a safer and more effective strategy. In terms of safety and effectiveness, the benefit of EVT (alone or included in a multimodal management strategy) for SMG III bAVMs needs to be confirmed by randomized controlled trials.",2023 Oct 1,2023,Journal of neurosurgery,139,4,1070-1077,eng,False,10.3171/2023.1.JNS222745;10.3171/2023.1.JNS222745,Journal Article;Multicenter Study;Observational Study,"Humans;Adult;Middle Aged;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/therapy/surgery;Microsurgery;Brain/surgery;*Embolization, Therapeutic/adverse effects/methods;*Radiosurgery",Spetzler-Martin grade III;arteriovenous malformations;endovascular neurosurgery;endovascular treatment;supplementary Spetzler-Martin grading scale;vascular disorders
35510560,Ruptured brain arteriovenous malformation in a pregnant woman: a case report.,"BACKGROUND: Brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) are vascular lesions that commonly present with intracranial haemorrhage. Pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of bAVM rupture. However, their natural history in pregnant women is uncertain. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 27-year-old female at 28 weeks of gestation presented with a compromised neurological status secondary to a ruptured left frontal Spetzler-Martin scale (SM) III + bAVM. An emergent caesarean section was performed due to the high risk of foetal distress.

24756516,Outcome after conservative management or intervention for unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations.,"IMPORTANCE: Whether conservative management is superior to interventional treatment for unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) is uncertain because of the shortage of long-term comparative data. OBJECTIVE: To compare the long-term outcomes of conservative management vs intervention for unruptured bAVM. DESIGN, SETTING, AND POPULATION: Population-based inception cohort study of 204 residents of Scotland aged 16 years or older who were first diagnosed as having an unruptured bAVM during 1999-2003 or 2006-2010 and followed up prospectively for 12 years. EXPOSURES: Conservative management (no intervention) vs intervention (any endovascular embolization, neurosurgical excision, or stereotactic radiosurgery alone or in combination). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cox regression analyses, with multivariable adjustment for prognostic factors and baseline imbalances if hazards were proportional, to compare rates of the primary outcome (death or sustained morbidity of any cause by Oxford Handicap Scale [OHS] score ≥2 for ≥2 successive years [0 = no symptoms and 6 = death]) and the secondary outcome (nonfatal symptomatic stroke or death due to bAVM, associated arterial aneurysm, or intervention). RESULTS: Of 204 patients, 103 underwent intervention. Those who underwent intervention were younger, more likely to have presented with seizure, and less likely to have large bAVMs than patients managed conservatively. During a median follow-up of 6.9 years (94% completeness), the rate of progression to the primary outcome was lower with conservative management during the first 4 years of follow-up (36 vs 39 events; 9.5 vs 9.8 per 100 person-years; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.35-0.99), but rates were similar thereafter. The rate of the secondary outcome was lower with conservative management during 12 years of follow-up (14 vs 38 events; 1.6 vs 3.3 per 100 person-years; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.19-0.72). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients aged 16 years or older diagnosed as having unruptured bAVM, use of conservative management compared with intervention was associated with better clinical outcomes for up to 12 years. Longer follow-up is required to understand whether this association persists.",2014 Apr 23-30,2014,JAMA,311,16,1661-9,eng,False,10.1001/jama.2014.3200;1861801;10.1001/jama.2014.3200,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adult;Aged;Cohort Studies;*Embolization, Therapeutic;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Neurosurgical Procedures/methods;*Radiosurgery;Scotland;Survival Analysis;Treatment Outcome;*Watchful Waiting",
24655098,Radiosurgery for ruptured intracranial arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECT: Ruptured intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are at a significantly greater risk for future hemorrhage than unruptured lesions, thereby necessitating treatment in the majority of cases. In a retrospective, single-center study, the authors describe the outcomes after radiosurgery in a large cohort of patients with ruptured AVMs. METHODS: From an institutional review board-approved, prospectively collected AVM radiosurgery database, the authors identified all patients with a history of AVM rupture. They analyzed obliteration rates in all patients in whom radiological follow-up data were available (n = 639). However, to account for the latency period associated with radiosurgery, only those patients with more than 2 years of radiological follow-up and those with earlier AMV obliteration were included in the analysis of prognostic factors related to obliteration and complications. This resulted in a cohort of 565 patients with ruptured AVMs for whom data were analyzed; these patients had a median radiological follow-up of 57 months and a median age of 29 years. Twenty-one percent of the patients underwent preradiosurgery embolization. The median volume and prescription dose were 2.1 cm(3) and 22 Gy, respectively. The Spetzler-Martin grade was III or higher in 56% of patients, the median radiosurgery-based AVM score was 1.08, and the Virginia Radiosurgery AVM Scale (RAS) score was 3 to 4 points in 44%. Survival and regression analyses were performed to determine obliteration rates over time and predictors of obliteration and complications. RESULTS: In the overall population of 639 patients with ruptured AVMs, the obliteration rate was 11.1% based on MRI only (71 of 639 patients), 56.0% based on angiography (358 of 639), and 67.1% based on combined modalities (429 of 639 patients). In the cohort of patients with 2 years of follow-up or an earlier AVM obliteration, the cumulative obliteration rate was 76% and the actuarial obliteration rates were 41% and 64% at 3 and 5 years, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified the absence of preradiosurgery embolization (p < 0.001), increased prescription dose (p = 0.001), the presence of a single draining vein (p = 0.046), no postradiosurgery-related hemorrhage (p = 0.007), and lower Virginia RAS score (p = 0.020) as independent predictors of obliteration. The annual risk of a hemorrhage occurring during the latency period was 2.0% and the rate of hemorrhage-related morbidity and mortality was 1.6%. Multivariate analysis showed that decreased prescription dose (p < 0.001) and multiple draining veins (p = 0.003) were independent predictors of postradiosurgery hemorrhage. The rates of symptomatic and permanent radiation-induced changes were 8% and 2.7%, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, a single draining vein (p < 0.001) and higher Virginia RAS score (p = 0.005) were independent predictors of radiation-induced changes following radiosurgery. CONCLUSIONS: Radiosurgery effectively treats ruptured AVMs with an acceptably low risk-to-benefit ratio. For patients with ruptured AVMs, favorable outcomes are more likely when preradiosurgical embolization is avoided and a higher prescription dose can be delivered.",2014 Aug,2014,Journal of neurosurgery,121,2,470-81,eng,True,10.3171/2014.2.JNS131605;10.3171/2014.2.JNS131605,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Child;Cohort Studies;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Kaplan-Meier Estimate;Male;Middle Aged;Postoperative Complications/epidemiology;Postoperative Hemorrhage/epidemiology;Prospective Studies;Radiosurgery/*methods;Recurrence;Reoperation/statistics & numerical data;Rupture;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",AVM = arteriovenous malformation;DSA = digital subtraction angiography;Gamma Knife;RAS = Radiosurgery AVM Scale;RBAS = radiosurgery-based AVM score;RIC = radiation-induced change;intracranial arteriovenous malformation;intracranial hemorrhage;stereotactic radiosurgery;stroke;vascular disorders
32717053,Improved Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformation Obliteration With 3-Dimensional Rotational Digital Subtraction Angiography for Radiosurgical Planning: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,"BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is well-established. Radiographic advantages exist for 3-dimensional rotational digital subtraction angiography (3DRA) over 2-dimensional digital subtraction angiography (2D DSA) in delineating AVM nidus structure for SRS treatment planning. However, currently there is limited to no data directly comparing 2D DSA versus 3DRA in terms of patient outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the use of 3DRA over 2D DSA in radiosurgical treatment planning for AVMs associates with improved clinical outcomes. METHODS: All AVM patients treated with SRS at our institution between the years 2000 and 2018 were identified. Primary outcomes were obliteration rates and time to obliteration (TTO); secondary outcomes included rates of post-SRS hemorrhage, salvage therapy, and symptomatic radionecrosis. A minimum of 12 mo of follow-up imaging/angiogram post-SRS was required, or alternatively evidence of obliteration on angiogram prior to 12 mo post-SRS. Single predictor and multivariable Cox regression and logistic regression models were constructed to test for association between radiographic, clinical, and treatment factors with outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 75 patients were included. Total 17 patients received 3DRA and 58 patients received 2D DSA, with a median follow-up of 3.29 yr. The 3DRA is significantly associated with improved TTO on single predictor (HR 2.87, 1.29-6.12; P = .0109) and multivariable analysis (HR 2.448, 1.076-5.750; P = .0330) and increased odds of achieving obliteration by 3 yr post-SRS on single predictor analysis (OR 6.044, 1.405-26.009; P = .0157). CONCLUSION: The 3DRA over 2D DSA in SRS treatment planning for AVMs may result in improved TTO and 3-yr obliteration rates. Further investigation and prospective study are warranted.",2020 Dec 15,2020,Neurosurgery,88,1,122-130,eng,False,10.1093/neuros/nyaa321;5876911;10.1093/neuros/nyaa321,Journal Article,"Adult;Angiography, Digital Subtraction/*methods;Arteriovenous Fistula/*surgery;Female;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional/*methods;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Logistic Models;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/*methods;Retrospective Studies;Surgery, Computer-Assisted/*methods;Treatment Outcome",Angiography;Intracranial arteriovenous malformation;Radiosurgery
18671629,Clinical and neuroimaging outcome of cerebral arteriovenous malformations after Gamma Knife surgery: analysis of the radiation injury rate depending on the arteriovenous malformation volume.,"OBJECT: In this paper the authors analyzed the clinical and neuroimaging outcomes of patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) after Gamma Knife surgery (GKS), focusing on the analysis of the radiation injury rate depending on the AVM volume. METHODS: Between 1997 and 2004, 277 consecutive patients with cerebral AVMs were treated with GKS. Of these patients, 218 were followed up for >or= 2 years. The mean age was 31 +/- 15 years, the median AVM volume was 3.4 cm3 (range 0.17-35.2 cm3), the median marginal dose was 18.0 Gy (range 10.0-25.0 Gy), and the mean follow-up duration was 44 +/- 20 months. The authors reduced the prescription dose by various amounts, depending on the AVM volume and location as prescribed in the classic guideline to avoid irreversible radiation injuries. RESULTS: The angiographic obliteration rate was 66.4% overall, and it was 81.7, 53.1, and 12.5% for small, medium, and large AVMs, respectively. The overall annual bleeding rate was 1.9%. The annual bleeding rate was 0.44 and 4.64% for small and large AVMs, respectively. Approximately 20% of the patients showed severe postradiosurgery imaging (PRI) changes. The rate of PRI change was 11.4, 33.3, and 9.5% for small, medium, and large AVM volume groups, respectively, and a permanent radiation injury developed in 5.1% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: By using the reduced dose from what is usually prescribed, the authors were able to obtain outcomes in small AVMs that were comparable to the outcomes described in previous reports. However, medium AVMs appear to still be at risk for adverse radiation effects. Last, in large AVMs, the authors were able to attain a tolerable rate of radiation injury; however, the clinical outcomes were quite disappointing following administration of a reduced dose of GKS for large AVMs.",2008 Aug,2008,Journal of neurosurgery,109,2,191-8,eng,True,10.3171/JNS/2008/109/8/0191;10.3171/JNS/2008/109/8/0191,Clinical Trial;Journal Article,"Adult;Cerebral Hemorrhage/epidemiology/etiology/pathology;Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/epidemiology/*pathology/*surgery;*Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Postoperative Complications/epidemiology/etiology/pathology;Prognosis;Radiation Injuries/epidemiology/*pathology;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects/statistics & numerical data;Risk Factors;Treatment Outcome",
27120932,[Results of Gamma Knife radiosurgical treatment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations].,"Gamma Knife treatments of arteriovenous malformations (AVM) are performed for about 40 years. This article presents the results of 123 patients treated for a brain AVM at the Gamma Knife Center ULB-Hôpital Erasme. Radiosurgical treatment is proposed following multidisciplinary discussion of the best therapeutic strategy based on specific parameters of the AVM. Gamma Knife irradiation was achieved for an AVM residue after endovascular embolization for 84% of patients, after microsurgery for 7% of patients, or after previous radiosurgical irradiation for 6% of patients. The whole volume of the nidus was irradiated in a single session for all patients. A mean margin dose of 22.3 Gy was delivered to the nidus, which had a mean volume of 3.3 cc. The maximum dose ranged from 30 Gy to 50 Gy (mean 44.1 Gy). All patients were prospectively followed after treatment with serial angio-MR and/or conventional angiography. A retrospective analysis shows complete obliteration of the AVM for 109 patients (89%) after 6 to 52 months (mean 32 months). For 14 patients the nidus was only partially obliterated from the radiosurgical procedure; for 9 patients a second irradiation was performed with subsequent complete occlusion of the AVM in all cases. So, 118 of 123 patients (96%) irradiated by Gamma Knife in 1 or 2 sessions were cured. Four patients bled after irradiation and before complete occlusion of the AVM, with neurological deficit for 2 patients. Transient neurological symptoms develop after treatment for 12 patients (10%), associated with postradic edema treated with corticoids. Permanent neurological worsening occurred in 5 patients (4%).

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Median age was 33 years (range 6-68 years). Irradiation was the only treatment in 55% patients. Other treatment modalities had been used prior to RS in 45%: one or more embolizations in 36%, surgery in 6%, and embolization and surgery in 3% patients. Nidus were supratentorial in 94% patients, infratentorial in 6% patients. Circular 15 MV x-ray minibeams (6-20 mm) were delivered in coronal arcs by a GE-CGR Saturne 43 Linac. Patient set-up included a Betti arm-chair, a Talairach frame. Prescribed peripheral dose was 25 Gy on the 60%-70% isodose (max dose 100%). Arteriographic results were reassessed in December 1997 at 48 to 96 months follow-up. RESULTS: The overall obliteration rate (OR) was 64% (108/169). AVM volumes ranged from 280 to 19,920 mm(3), median 2460 mm(3). OR was 70% for AVM </= 4200 mm(3) 4200 mm(3) (p 25 mm (p = 0.04). OR was 71%, in the absence of embolization, vs. 54% for previously embolized nidus (p = 0.03). OR was 71% for monocentric RS vs. 54% for multi-isocenters (p 28 Gy vs. 55% for values </= 28 Gy (p 79% vs. 57% for lower values (p 17 Gy, vs. 59% for mLd </= 16 Gy (p 40%, vs. 54% for mLi </= 40% (p 85% vs. 60% for CR </= 84% (NS). For patients treated according to our protocol, i.e., 24-26 Gy on the 60%-70% isodoses, OR was higher (68%) than for other patients (47%) (p = 0.02). After multivariate analysis, absence of previous embolization and mono isocentric-irradiation were independent factors predicting obliteration. Complications were: recurrent hemorrhage, 4 patients (1 patient died); brain necrosis on MRI, 2 patients; subsequent epilepsy, 4 patients; other subsequent neurologic deficits, 3 patients. CONCLUSION: Overall OR was 64% (48-96 months follow-up). After monovariate analysis higher ORs were associated with smaller volumes </= 4200 mm(3), smaller nidus size </= 25 mm, absence of prior embolization, monoisocentric RS, higher values for mean and minimum lesion doses and compliance to our protocol. Higher values for the peripheral dose and isodose tended to give better results.

33512984,Surgical selection and outcomes among elderly patients with brain arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVE: Studies of resection of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in the elderly population are scarce. This study examined factors influencing patient selection and surgical outcome among elderly patients. METHODS: Patients 65 years of age and older who underwent resection of an unruptured or ruptured brain AVM treated by two surgeons at two centers were identified. Patient demographic characteristics, AVM characteristics, clinical presentation, and outcomes measured using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) were analyzed. For subgroup analyses, patients were dichotomized into two age groups (group 1, 65-69 years old; group 2, ≥ 70 years old). RESULTS: Overall, 112 patients were included in this study (group 1, n = 61; group 2, n = 51). Most of the patients presented with hemorrhage (71%), a small nidus (< 3 cm, 79%), and a low Spetzler-Martin (SM) grade (grade I or II, 63%) and were favorable surgical candidates according to the supplemented SM grade (supplemented SM grade < 7, 79%). A smaller AVM nidus was statistically significantly more likely to be present in patients with infratentorial AVMs (p = 0.006) and with a compact AVM nidus structure (p = 0.02). A larger AVM nidus was more likely to be treated with preoperative embolization (p < 0.001). Overall outcome was favorable (mRS scores 0-3) in 71% of the patients and was statistically independent from age group or AVM grading. Patients with ruptured AVMs at presentation had significantly better preoperative mRS scores (p < 0.001) and more favorable mRS scores at the last follow-up (p = 0.04) than patients with unruptured AVMs. CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes were favorable after AVM resection in both groups of patients. Elderly patients with brain AVMs treated microsurgically were notable for small nidus size, AVM rupture, and low SM grades. Microsurgical resection is an important treatment modality for elderly patients with AVMs, and supplemented SM grading is a useful tool for the selection of patients who are most likely to achieve good neurological outcomes after resection.

23238943,Treatment for brain arteriovenous malformation in the 1998-2011 period and review of the literature.,"PURPOSE: The results of the treatment of pial AVM provided at our neurosurgical centre are presented. Based on these results and on an overview of literary data on the efficacy and complications of each therapeutic modality, the algorithm of indications, as used at our institution, is presented. COHORT OF PATIENTS: The series comprises 195 patients, aged 9 to 87 years and treated in the years 1998-2011. The surgical group consists of 76 patients; of these, 49 patients solely received endovascular treatment, 25 were consulted and referred directly to the radiosurgical unit, and the remaining 45 were recommended to abide by the strategy of ""watch and wait"". RESULTS: In the surgical group, serious complications were 3.9 %, at a 96.1 % therapeutic efficacy. As for AVM treated with purely endovascular methods, serious procedural complications were seen in 4.1 % of patients, with efficacy totalling 32.7 %. One observed patient suffered bleeding, resulting in death. For comparison with literary data for each modality, a survival analysis without haemorrhage following monotherapy for AVM with each particular modality was carried out. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our analysis, we have devised the following algorithm of treatment: 1. We regard surgical treatment as the treatment of choice for AVM of Spetzler-Martin (S-M) grades I and II, and only for those grade III cases that are surgically accessible. 2. Endovascular intervention should mainly be used for preoperative embolisation, as a curative procedure for lower-grade AVM in patients with comorbidities, and as palliation only for higher-grade cases. 3. Stereotactic irradiation with Leksell Gamma Knife (LGK) is advisable, mainly for poorly accessible, deep-seated grade-III AV malformations. In the case of lower grades, the final decision is left to the properly informed patient. 4. Observation should be used as the method of choice in AVM of grades IV and V, where active therapy carries greater risk than the natural course of the disease.",2013 Feb,2013,Acta neurochirurgica,155,2,199-209,eng,False,10.1007/s00701-012-1572-1;10.1007/s00701-012-1572-1,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Algorithms;Child;Cohort Studies;Embolization, Therapeutic;Endovascular Procedures;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/*diagnosis/*therapy;Male;Middle Aged;Patient Selection;Radiosurgery;Treatment Outcome;Watchful Waiting;Young Adult",
16257134,"Gamma knife radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations in children/adolescents and adults. Part I: Differences in epidemiologic, morphologic, and clinical characteristics, permanent complications, and bleeding in the latency period.","PURPOSE: To compare the epidemiologic, morphologic, and clinical characteristics of 92 children/adolescents (Group A) and 362 adults (Group B) with cerebral arteriovenous malformations (cAVMs) considered suitable for radiosurgery; to correlate radiosurgery-related permanent complication and post-radiosurgery bleeding rates in the 75 children/adolescents and 297 adults available for follow-up. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Radiosurgery was performed with a model C 201-source Co60 Leksell Gamma Unit (Elekta Instruments, Stockholm, Sweden). Fisher exact two-tailed, Wilcoxon rank-sum, and two-sample binomial exact tests were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: There were significant differences between the two populations in sex (p = 0.015), clinical presentation (p = 0.001), and location (p = 0.008). The permanent complication rate was lower in younger (1.3%) than in older patients (5.4%), although the difference was not significant (p = 0.213). The postradiosurgery bleeding rate was lower in Group A (1.3%) than in Group B (2.7%) (p = 0.694), with global actuarial bleeding rates of 0.56% per year and 1.15% per year, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The different characteristics of child/adolescent and adult cAVMs suggest that they should be considered two distinct vascular disorders. The similar rates of radiosurgery-related complications and latency period bleeding in the two populations show that gamma knife radiosurgery does not expose young patients to a higher risk of sequelae than that for older patients.",2006 Mar 1,2006,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",64,3,904-13,eng,False,S0360-3016(05)02376-X;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2005.07.983,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Age Factors;Aged;Cerebral Hemorrhage/epidemiology/etiology;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/epidemiology/pathology/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Postoperative Hemorrhage/epidemiology/etiology;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects;Retrospective Studies",
23183855,Late clinical and radiological complications of stereotactical radiosurgery of arteriovenous malformations of the brain.,"INTRODUCTION: Post-radiation injury of patients with brain arteriovenous malformations (AVM) include blood-brain barrier breakdown (BBBB), edema, and necrosis. Prevalence, clinical relevance, and response to treatment are poorly known. We present a series of consecutive brain AVM treated with stereotactic radiosurgery describing the appearance of radiation injury and clinical complications. METHODS: Consecutive patients with annual clinical and radiological follow-up (median length 63 months). Edema and BBBB were classified in four groups (minimal, perilesional, moderate, or severe), and noted together with necrosis. Clinical symptoms of interest were intracranial hypertension, new neurological deficits, new seizures, and brain hemorrhages. RESULTS: One hundred two cases, median age 34 years, 52% male. Median irradiated volume 3.8 cc, dose to the margin of the nidus 18.5 Gy. Nineteen patients underwent a second radiosurgery. Only 42.2% patients remained free from radiation injury. Edema was found in 43.1%, blood-brain barrier breakdown in 20.6%, necrosis in 6.9%. Major injury (moderate or severe edema, moderate or severe BBBB, or necrosis) was found in 20 of 102 patients (19.6%). AVM diameter >3 cm and second radiosurgery were independent predictors. Time to the worst imaging was 60 months. Patients with major radiation injury had a hazard ratio for appearance of focal deficits of 7.042 (p = 0.04), of intracranial hypertension 2.857 (p = 0.025), hemorrhage into occluded nidus 9.009 (p = 0.079), appearance of new seizures not significant.

25913746,Repeat radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"We perform a systematic review of repeat radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM) with an emphasis on lesion obliteration rates and complications. Radiosurgery is an accepted treatment modality for AVM located in eloquent cortex or deep brain structures. For residual or persistent lesions, repeat radiosurgery can be considered if sufficient time has passed to allow for a full appreciation of treatment effects, usually at least 3years. A systematic review was performed in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. References for this review were identified by searches of MEDLINE, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases. A total of 14 studies comprising 733 patients met the review criteria and were included. For series that reported target dose at both first and repeat treatments, the weighted means were 19.42Gy and 19.06Gy, respectively. The mean and median obliteration rate for the repeat radiosurgery treatments were 61% (95% confidence interval 51.9-71.7%) and 61.5%, respectively. The median follow up following radiosurgery ranged from 19.5 to 80months. Time to complete obliteration after the repeat treatment ranged from 21 to 40.8months. The most common complications of repeat radiosurgery for AVM included hemorrhage (7.6%) and radiation-induced changes (7.4%).

35255632,Genetics and Emerging Therapies for Brain Arteriovenous Malformations.,"Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are characterized by a high-pressure, low-resistance vascular nidus created by direct shunting of blood from feeding arteries into arterialized veins, bypassing intervening capillaries. AVMs pose a risk of spontaneous rupture because the vessel walls are continuously exposed to increased shear stress and abnormal flow phenomena, which lead to vessel wall inflammation and distinct morphologic changes. The annual rupture rate is estimated at 2%, and once an AVM ruptures, the risk of rerupture increases 5-fold. The ability of AVMs to grow, regress, recur, and undergo remodeling shows their dynamic nature. Identifying the underlying cellular and molecular pathways of AVMs not only helps us understand their natural physiology but also allows us to directly block vital pathways, thus preventing AVM development and progression. Management of AVMs is challenging and often necessitates a multidisciplinary approach, including neurosurgical, endovascular, and radiosurgical expertise. Because many of these procedures are invasive, carry a risk of inciting hemorrhage, or are controversial, the demand for pharmacologic treatment options is increasing. In this review, we introduce novel findings of cellular and molecular AVM physiology and highlight key signaling mediators that are potential targets for AVM treatment. Furthermore, we give an overview of syndromes associated with hereditary and nonhereditary AVM formation and discuss causative genetic alterations.",2022 Mar,2022,World neurosurgery,159,,327-337,eng,False,S1878-8750(21)01624-7;10.1016/j.wneu.2021.10.127;S1878-8750(21)01624-7;10.1016/j.wneu.2021.10.127,Journal Article;Review,*Arteriovenous Malformations/complications;Brain/metabolism;Capillaries;Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/genetics/therapy;*Nervous System Malformations/complications;*Radiosurgery,Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia;KRAS;Molecular;Remodeling;Signaling;VEGF

The AVMs were shown with different degrees of regression in size in posttherapeutic periods. The peripheral leukocytes of these patients were collected at the last neuroimaging follow-ups. The leukocytes, before and 1 and 2 h after 8 Gy external gamma-irradiation, were evaluated for the amounts of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) in 50 randomly selected individual nuclei by the neutral single cell gel electrophoresis, or so-called comet analysis. After being adjusted for gender and age at radiosurgery, the individuals with less posttherapeutic regression in AMV sizes or relatively poor or inadequate responses to radiosurgery were shown to have significantly higher DSB repair capacity on their leukocytes by comet analysis. These results suggested that in vitro radiosensitivity of peripheral leukocytes may provide valuable information for predicting therapeutic response or for adjusting irradiation doses in AVM radiosurgery.",2004 Jun,2004,Journal of radiation research,45,2,269-74,eng,False,JST.JSTAGE/jrr/45.269;10.1269/jrr.45.269,"Clinical Trial;Comparative Study;Journal Article;Randomized Controlled Trial;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't;Validation Study","Adolescent;Adult;Child;DNA/radiation effects/ultrastructure;*DNA Damage;DNA Repair/*radiation effects;Feasibility Studies;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnosis/pathology/*radiotherapy;Leukocytes/*radiation effects/ultrastructure;Male;Middle Aged;Outcome Assessment, Health Care/*methods;Radiosurgery/*methods;Statistics as Topic;Treatment Outcome",

METHODS: A total of 491 patients with brain AVMs treated with GKS from June 2002 to September 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. All patients were classified into the incidental (n = 105), symptomatic unruptured (n = 216), or ruptured AVM (n = 170) groups. RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis of incidental, symptomatic unruptured, and ruptured AVMs was 40.3, 36.7, and 27.6 years, respectively. The mean nidus volume was 3.9, 5.7, and 2.4 cm3, respectively. Deep venous drainage was identified in 34, 54, and 76% patients, respectively. There were no significant differences in obliteration rates after GKS between the 3 groups (64.8, 61.1, and 65.9%, respectively) after a mean follow-up period of 60.5 months; however, patients with incidental AVM had a significantly lower post-GKS hemorrhage rate than patients with symptomatic unruptured or ruptured AVMs (annual hemorrhage rate of 1.07, 2.87, and 2.69%; p = 0.028 and p = 0.049, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant difference in clinical and anatomical characteristics between incidental, symptomatic unruptured, and ruptured AVMs. The obliteration rate after GKS is not significantly different between the 3 groups. Meanwhile, an older age at diagnosis and lower hemorrhage rate after GKS in incidental AVMs suggest that they have a more indolent natural course with a lower life-long risk of hemorrhage.",2021,2021,"Cerebrovascular diseases (Basel, Switzerland)",50,2,222-230,eng,True,10.1159/000513280;000513280;10.1159/000513280,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Age Factors;Aged;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Humans;*Incidental Findings;Infant;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/*radiotherapy;Intracranial Hemorrhages/etiology;Male;Middle Aged;Postoperative Hemorrhage/etiology;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects;Retrospective Studies;Risk Assessment;Risk Factors;Rupture, Spontaneous;Time Factors;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",Arteriovenous malformation;Gamma knife radiosurgery;Hemorrhage;Incidental AVM;Unruptured AVM

Twenty-seven of 37 cases with haemorrhagic onset received surgical resection with or without pre-operative embolisation. Total extirpation was achieved in 23 cases, and small residual nidus was treated by postoperative radiosurgery in two of four subtotally resected cases. Another 6 of 37 haemorrhagic cases received radiosurgery with or without preradiosurgical embolisation. Four cases with haemorrhagic onset received partial embolisation. Finally, 29 of 37 haemorrhagic cases obtained complete disappearance of nidus. On the other hand, 4 of 26 non-haemorrhagic cases received surgical total resection, 5 radiosurgery, 9 partial embolisation and 8 observation without treatment. Microsurgical morbidity was 9% and mortality was 0%. Post-treatment haemorrhage was seen in 11 cases (1 after subtotal resection, 4 after radiosurgery, 6 after partial embolisation) and was fatal in 3 cases.

Data from prospective data lacks support for the best approach. METHODS: We retrospectively review patients with AVM at a single institution that were treated with radiation or a combination of radiation and embolization. These patients were divided into two groups based on radiation fractionation: SRS and fSRS. RESULTS: One-hundred and thirty-five (135) patients were first assessed and 121 met study criteria. Mean age at treatment was 30.5 years, and most patients were male. The groups were otherwise balanced, except for nidus size. SRS group had smaller lesions (P > 0.005). SRS correlates to better chance of nidus occlusion and lesser chance of retreatment. Complications such as radionecrosis (5%) and bleeding after nidus occlusion (1 patient) were rare. CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic radiosurgery plays an important role on the treatment of AVM. Whenever possible, SRS should be preferred.

30885595,Clinical outcome of brainstem arteriovenous malformations after incomplete nidus obliteration.,"PURPOSE: Brainstem arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) present a formidable therapeutic challenge, and a variety of surgical and non-surgical treatment strategies can be used to obliterate the AVM nidus, eliminating its risk of hemorrhage. However, complete obliteration of brainstem AVMs is often not possible. We aimed to investigate the natural history of brainstem AVMs with incomplete nidus obliteration after initial treatment. METHODS: Data from consecutive patients who presented to our institution during the study period with a brainstem AVM and residual nidus after treatment were retrospectively reviewed. We evaluated patients for the incidence of AVM rupture and calculated the risk of rupture after treatment resulted in incomplete nidus obliteration. RESULTS: A total of 14 patients were included, five of whom suffered rupture after incomplete nidus obliteration (36%). Annual risk of rupture was 4.9% (95% CI: 1.60-11.5) per patient over a median follow-up of 72 months. The most common treatment modality of these patients was SRS-alone (n = 6), and two (33%) patients who underwent this treatment later ruptured after 103 and 130 months. Of the five patients who ruptured after treatment, 80% had already ruptured once, and 80% had an intranidal and/or feeding artery aneurysm. CONCLUSIONS: Brainstem AVMs with incomplete nidus obliteration are at high risk of future rupture. Patients with brainstem AVMs who have a residual nidus after treatment should be counselled about the risk of AVM rupture and be recommended to undergo close follow-up imaging studies to monitor the nidus.",2019 Jul,2019,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society,65,,66-70,eng,False,S0967-5868(19)30127-4;10.1016/j.jocn.2019.03.009;S0967-5868(19)30127-4;10.1016/j.jocn.2019.03.009,Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Arteriovenous Fistula/surgery;Brain Stem/surgery;Child;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/methods;Retrospective Studies;Rupture/surgery;Treatment Outcome,Arteriovenous malformation;Brainstem;Clinical outcome;Rupture;Stereotactic radiosurgery
11404698,[Radiotherapeutic basis of radiosurgery as applied to cerebral arteriovenous malformations: dose-volume effects].,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To attempt to analyze the basic effects of radiosurgery as applied to cerebral arteriovenous malformations. METHODS: We reviewed and discussed the previous issues of the international literature concerning radiobiological principles of radiosurgery of arteriovenous malformations. RESULTS: The irradiated volume contained both a target volume consisting of abnormal vessels of the nidus often embedded within connective tissue stroma and the surrounding normal brain tissue. These were late-responding tissues after the radiation and sensitive tissues to high dose per fraction. There was not resistant hypoxic cell that could be killed efficiently with fractionated treatment. The therapeutic ratio between damage in the arteriovenous malformation nidus and late complications in the surrounding tissues was independent of fractionation. Furthermore, sterilization of all clonogenic cells in the target volume was not necessary to obtain complete obliteration of arteriovenous malformation. Consequently, there was nothing to be gained by a fractionated course relative to a stereotactic high single-dose irradiation for a small targeted volume (<=25 mm in diameter or<=4 200 mm(3)). The minimum target dose (Dmin) seemed to be the dosimetric independent predicting factor for complete obliteration. The Dmin-response relationship suggested a threshold dose of 5 Gy to 10 Gy and the better effects following Dmin from 20 Gy to 25 Gy. A Dmin above 25 Gy significantly increased the risk of serious late complications. The treated volume seemed to be the significant independent predicting dosimetric factor for developing persistent symptomatic sequelae. The optimum dose to deliver to obtain complete obliteration of an arteriovenous malformation was selected by balancing the expected obliteration rate for each dose with the corresponding risks from radiosurgery depending on size, location, shape and dose distribution. CONCLUSION: Although the basic pathological process is still uncertain there is a strong rationale for stereotactic radiotherapy delivered in a high single-dose for small arteriovenous malformations.",2001 May,2001,Neuro-Chirurgie,47,2-3 Pt 2,212-20,fre,False,75799,Journal Article;Review,"Blood Vessels/radiation effects;Brain Damage, Chronic/epidemiology/etiology/physiopathology;Cell Hypoxia;Cell Survival;Cicatrix/etiology;Dose Fractionation, Radiation;Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Radiation Injuries/epidemiology/etiology/physiopathology;Radiosurgery/adverse effects/*methods;Risk;Stereotaxic Techniques;Stromal Cells/radiation effects;Time Factors",

The objective of the present study was the evaluation of the different management options for these lesions and the corresponding prognosis of patients. METHODS: Between 2000 and 2005, 12 patients with intracranial AVM initially treated by GKR were reevaluated at Tokyo Women's Medical University because of delayed cyst formation in the vicinity of the target area. There were 7 men and 5 women. The mean age of the patients was 31.8 years at the time of GKR and 41.1 years at the time of complication. The average period between treatment and diagnosis of the complication constituted 6.7 years. All AVMs had lobar location and showed complete angiographic obliteration after GKR. RESULTS: The most common neurological signs and symptoms at the time of cyst presentation were headache (10 cases) and seizures (4 cases). Two patients were asymptomatic. Three patients underwent surgery soon after the diagnosis of the cyst, whereas initial observation was done in another 9. Among the latter, 5 patients had to be treated surgically thereafter because of persistent or aggravated neurological symptoms associated with radiological cyst expansion. Four other patients, including both asymptomatic ones, are in stable condition without surgery. Follow-up after treatment of the cyst varied from 7 to 60 months (average, 34.3 months).

We developed a deep learning approach to automatically segment cerebrovascular-anatomical maps from multiple high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging/angiography (MRI/MRA) sequences in AVM patients, with the goal of facilitating target delineation. Twenty-three AVM patients who were evaluated for radiosurgery and underwent multi-parametric MRI/MRA were included. A hybrid semi-automated and manual approach was used to label MRI/MRAs with arteries, veins, brain parenchyma, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), and embolized vessels. Next, these labels were used to train a convolutional neural network to perform this task. Imaging from 17 patients (6362 image slices) was used for training, and 6 patients (1224 slices) for validation. Performance was evaluated by Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC). Classification performance was good for arteries, veins, brain parenchyma, and CSF, with DSCs of 0.86, 0.91, 0.98, and 0.91, respectively in the validation image set. Performance was lower for embolized vessels, with a DSC of 0.75.

34481717,Analysis of potential time saving in brain arteriovenous malformation stereotactic radiosurgery planning using a new software platform.,"To evaluate the utility of integrating a 3D vessel tree co-registration software platform into the stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) workflow and its time saving for brain arteriovenous malformation (bAVM) treatment in adults compared to the conventional stereotactic head frame workflow. Eight consecutive adult bAVM cases were selected and retrospectively reviewed. Total number of angiograms and SRS procedures were 8. The electronic medical records were analyzed by time stamps to determine the length of time for each component of the set-up, transport, and frame removal. Times were averaged and the start of sedation by anesthesia used as a surrogate for the start of the frame application process. Reductions in workflow times were then modeled assuming cerebral angiography as a separate procedure. There were 8 adult bAVM cases included. Six were female. All patients had a single treatment session. Average age was 51.5 years (Range: 36-71). All patients were treated under monitored anesthesia care. In 6 patients, the AVM was deeply located (basal ganglia, midbrain, brainstem); in 2 cases, the lesion was frontal. Spetzler-Martin grades were 4 (50%) Grade 2 and 4 (50%) Grade 3. The average prescription isodose volume (PIV) and 12 Gy volumes (V(12Gy)) were 0.85 cc and 1.74 cc, respectively. The mean time from frame application to arrival in the angiography room was 111.5 minutes (range 40 to 171 min; median 107 min; SD 35.3 min); transport from angiography room to SRS was 47.5 minutes (range 15 to 107 min; median 36 min; SD 31.1 min), and frame removal after SRS was 20.5 minutes (range 10 to 47 min; median 16 min; SD 11.6 min). The average total additional time for the entire process of frame application, patient transportation, and frame removal was 132 minutes (range 87 to 181 min; median 127.5 min; SD 28.4 min). Therefore, assuming a non-frame based workflow and with angiography performed ahead of the actual radiosurgical treatment, the total time savings on the day of treatment was estimated at 132 minutes (range 87 to 181 min; median 127.5 min; SD 28.4 min). The ability to perform angiography, image fusion, and treatment planning for the actual day-of-delivery using 3-dimensional vessel tree co-registration could result in significant time savings over traditional workflow practices. Further experience with this system will evaluate its accuracy, reproducibility, and potential broader use in SRS workflow paradigms for the treatment of vascular pathologies.

29408495,Multimodality Management of Vein of Galen Malformations-An Institutional Experience.,"BACKGROUND: The vein of Galen aneurysmal malformation (VGM) is a rare intracranial arteriovenous fistula with a dramatic manifestation during infancy and 100% mortality without treatment. Therapeutic strategies for VGMs have changed over time as a result of advances in endovascular techniques. We present our experience and multimodality approach within the last 4 decades. METHODS: A retrospective analysis and angiographic review were performed of patients with VGM between 1975 and 2016 at our institution. RESULTS: Eighteen consecutive patients were identified, including 10 with choroidal and 8 with mural VGMs. In 37 endovascular interventions, a transarterial approach was mostly performed (82.8%). One patient was initially treated surgically and received 2 Gamma Knife treatments after multiple embolizations. The preferred embolization agent was histoacryl for choroidal VGMs and a combination of coils and histoacryl for mural VGMs. Total occlusion was achieved in 87.5% of mural VGMs and 11.1% of choroidal VGMs. Cerebral hemorrhages and infarction occurred only in patients younger than 1 month. At a median follow-up interval of 4.6 years, good outcome was achieved in 53.8% and poor outcome in 46.2%, with an overall mortality of 16.7%. Poor outcome was significantly associated with choroidal-type VGMs, age <1 month at first embolization, and incomplete occlusion. CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular embolization using a transarterial approach is the therapy of choice. Gamma Knife radiosurgery can be considered as second-line therapy in a multimodal approach. Whereas treatment within the first month of life is associated with the highest mortality and complications, we did not detect any severe adverse events thereafter.",2018 Apr,2018,World neurosurgery,112,,e837-e847,eng,False,S1878-8750(18)30215-8;10.1016/j.wneu.2018.01.172;S1878-8750(18)30215-8;10.1016/j.wneu.2018.01.172,Journal Article,"Child;Child, Preschool;Combined Modality Therapy/methods;Embolization, Therapeutic/methods;Endovascular Procedures/methods;Female;Humans;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Male;Radiosurgery/methods;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;Vein of Galen Malformations/*therapy",Embolization;Endovascular;Gamma Knife;Pediatrics;Vein of Galen Malformation
10795888,Cerebral arteriovenous malformations in children.,"In spite of their congenital origin, only 18-20% of cerebral AVMs are diagnosed during infancy and childhood. Intracranial haemorrhage is the presenting clinical manifestation in 75-80% of paediatric patients and is associated with a high morbidity and mortality. The natural history of untreated cerebral AVMs in children is worse than in adults, in relation to a longer life expectation, a higher annual risk of AVM bleeding (3.2% vs. 2.2%) and a higher incidence of posterior fossa and basal ganglia AVMs, most of which present with massive haemorrhages. The surgical excision remains the treatment of choice for parenchymal AVMs in children; AVM complete removal is currently achieved in 70-90% of the patients. With the advent of new agents for endovascular management, preoperative AVM embolization has further improved surgical results. Stereotactic radiosurgery appears to be a successful treatment option in small or moderate sized AVMs. Recent studies have demonstrated low complication rates with this technique in paediatric patients. We reviewed our experience with 37 paediatric AVMs treated at the Section of Paediatric Neurosurgery of the Catholic University of Rome between 1980 and 1997. Twenty-three patients underwent surgery as the only treatment modality; endovascular embolization was combined with the surgical treatment in a further four cases. Radiosurgery was utilized as the only treatment in three patients and in combination with other techniques in an other three children (with surgery in one case and with AVM embolization in the remaining two subjects). No treatment was carried out in three patients because of excessively critical condition on admission; endovascular embolization failed in a further patient because of the anatomical complexity of the malformation. Previous studies have demonstrated a quite strict correlation between AVM complexity based on Spetzler and Martin's grading system and patients outcome. A less direct relationship has been observed in the present study. In our experience the factors which were more closely predictive of patients' outcome were the occurrence of an AVM bleeding and the neurological status on admission. In spite of the low number of cases in the single subsets of patients this study seems to support the role of AVM embolization and radiosurgery as effective adjuvant techniques in the management of cerebral AVMs in children.",2000,2000,Acta neurochirurgica,142,2,145-56; discussion 156-8,eng,False,10.1007/s007010050017,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Child;Child, Preschool;*Embolization, Therapeutic;Female;Humans;Infant;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/pathology/surgery/*therapy;Intracranial Hemorrhages/etiology;Male;Prognosis;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Severity of Illness Index;Treatment Outcome",
21489706,Volumetric modulated arc-based hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for the treatment of selected intracranial arteriovenous malformations: dosimetric report and early clinical experience.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate, with a dosimetric and clinical feasibility study, RapidArc (a volumetric modulated arc technique) for hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy treatment of large arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Nine patients were subject to multimodality imaging (magnetic resonance, computed tomography, and digital subtraction angiography) to determine nidus and target volumes, as well as involved organs at risk (optical structures, inner ear, brain stem). Plans for multiple intensity-modulated arcs with a single isocenter were optimized for a fractionation of 25 Gy in 5 fractions. All plans were optimized for 6-MV photon beams. Dose-volume histograms were analyzed to assess plan quality. Delivery parameters were reported to appraise technical features of RapidArc, and pretreatment quality assurance measurements were carried out to report on quality of delivery. RESULTS: Average size of AVM nidus was 26.2 cm(3), and RapidArc plans provided complete target coverage with minimal overdosage (V(100%) = 100% and V(110%) < 1%) and excellent homogeneity (<6%). Organs at risk were highly spared. The D(1%) to chiasm, eyes, lenses, optic nerves, and brainstem (mean ± SD) was 6.4 ± 8.3, 1.9 ± 3.8, 2.3 ± 2.2, 0.7 ± 0.9, 4.4 ± 7.2, 12.2 ± 9.6 Gy, respectively. Conformity index (CI(95%)) was 2.2 ± 0.1. The number of monitor units per gray was 277 ± 45, total beam-on time was 2.5 ± 0.3 min. Planning vs. delivery γ pass rate was 98.3% ± 0.9%. None of the patients developed acute toxicity. With a median follow-up of 9 months, 3 patients presented with deterioration of symptoms and were found to have postradiation changes but responded symptomatically to steroids. These patients continue to do well on follow-up. One patient developed headache and seizures, which was attributed to intracranial bleed, confirmed on imaging. CONCLUSION: Hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy can be successfully delivered using the RapidArc form of volumetric arc technology for intracranial AVMs. The quality of delivery and calculated parameters are in agreement with each other and are in line with published reports for other sites.",2012 Mar 1,2012,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",82,3,1278-84,eng,False,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2011.02.005;S0360-3016(11)00238-0;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2011.02.005,Evaluation Study;Journal Article,"Adult;Angiography, Digital Subtraction;Brain Stem/radiation effects;Ear, Inner/radiation effects;Eye/radiation effects;Feasibility Studies;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Organs at Risk/radiation effects;Radiation Injuries/drug therapy/prevention & control;Radiosurgery/adverse effects/*methods;Radiotherapy Dosage;Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted/methods;Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated/adverse effects/*methods;Steroids/therapeutic use;Tomography, X-Ray Computed;Young Adult",
27368509,Management Outcome of Brainstem Arteriovenous Malformations: The Role of Radiosurgery.,"INTRODUCTION: Management decisions for brainstem arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are complicated by balancing the risks of treatment and natural progression to hemorrhage. The present study seeks to compare radiosurgery and conservative management outcomes in brainstem AVMs. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of patients with brainstem AVM seen at our institution from 1990 to 2013. Patients missing baseline information or those lost to follow-up were excluded. Clinical and angiographic characteristics and subsequent hemorrhagic risk were evaluated according to brainstem AVM location and treatment modality. RESULTS: We identified 30 patients with brainstem AVM with complete data. Mean age was 41.6 ± 20.3 years, and 53.3% (n = 16) were male. Sixteen (53.3%) presented with hemorrhage. Twelve patients (40.0%) were conservatively managed, and 18 were treated. Sixteen (88.9%) of the treated patients underwent radiosurgery, 1 (5.6%) underwent surgery, and 1 (5.6%) underwent embolization only. Average follow-up period was 4.7 ± 5.7 years, and 5 patients (16.7%) experienced recurrent hemorrhage, 3 of whom were in the radiosurgery group and 2 in the conservative group, giving an annual recurrent hemorrhage risk of 3.7% and 4.8%, respectively. Lesion obliteration was achieved in 8 patients (26.7%). Baseline clinical and angiographic factors were similar between the radiosurgery and conservative group. Obliteration was achieved in 43.8% of those treated with radiosurgery (P = 0.008). Despite similar baseline modified Rankin Scale scores, more patients had improvement of modified Rankin Scale score at last follow-up in the radiosurgery group (P = 0.004). Recurrent hemorrhage during follow-up was similar between the 2 groups (P = 0.887). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that when patients with brainstem AVM are selected cautiously, radiosurgery may achieve obliteration and symptom relief without increasing subsequent hemorrhage risk.",2016 Oct,2016,World neurosurgery,94,,64-72,eng,False,S1878-8750(16)30467-3;10.1016/j.wneu.2016.06.082;S1878-8750(16)30467-3;10.1016/j.wneu.2016.06.082,Journal Article,"Adult;Brain Stem/*blood supply;Cohort Studies;Conservative Treatment;Databases, Factual;Embolization, Therapeutic/*methods;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/*therapy;Intracranial Hemorrhages/etiology;Male;Middle Aged;Neurosurgical Procedures/*methods;Radiosurgery/*methods;Recurrence;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",Arteriovenous malformation;Brainstem;Functional Outcome;Radiosurgery
23205799,New nidus formation adjacent to the target site of an arteriovenous malformation treated by Gamma Knife surgery.,"New nidi are rarely found adjacent to the resection margin following treatment for an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), especially in adults. In addition, there are no reports in adults of new nidus formation adjacent to the targeted site of an AVM that angiography has verified to be completely obliterated by radiosurgery. The authors present their experience with recurrent AVMs following AVM radiosurgery in 3 patients whose ages were 9 years, 10 years, and 33 years. None of the patients had been treated with embolization before radiosurgery. Two patients had a history of intracerebral hemorrhage before radiosurgery. New lesions developed around the obliterated nidi in all 3 cases. Angiography performed after the first radiosurgery confirmed complete removal of the nidus in all 3 patients, and new nidus formation was detected 31, 132, and 36 months after the initial GKS. The new lesions were also treated by GKS. Occasionally, in patients with recurrent AVMs, such as those described in this paper, long-term clinical and angiographic follow-up may be required, even if complete occlusion is originally shown on angiograms.",2012 Dec,2012,Journal of neurosurgery,117 Suppl,,120-5,eng,False,10.3171/2012.8.GKS12994;10.3171/2012.8.GKS12994,Case Reports;Journal Article,Adult;Cerebral Angiography;Cerebral Hemorrhage/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Child;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Male;Radiosurgery/*instrumentation;Recurrence;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome,
11678401,Gamma knife outcome models as a reference standard in the embolisation of cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"BACKGROUND: We sought to utilise outcome models from Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) to cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM) as a reference standard in assessing the clinical outcome of embolisation, thus comparing the outcomes of two different management alternatives, in the same patients. METHODS: 87 consecutive patients with 88 AVM were admitted during 1997-1999 for initial embolisation of an AVM. The clinical outcomes were recorded prospectively. Angiography under stereotactic conditions with measurement of AVM volume was performed before and after embolisation. GKRS outcome models were used to predict obliteration rate, complication rate and risk of haemorrhage before and after embolisation. The clinical outcome of embolisation followed by predicted outcome of adjunct GKRS was then compared with the predicted outcome of GKRS as the only treatment. FINDINGS: Eight patients were subjected to microcatheterisation but not to embolisation. By the end of the study period, embolisation had been terminated in 55 patients out of 80 (69%). The predicted outcome of GKRS alone was 58 obliterations and 12 complications while that of the combined management was 58 obliterations and 15 complications. The difference was not significant on the p < 0.1 level. INTERPRETATION: Volume measurement from angiography and outcome models from Gamma Knife radiosurgery are useful as a reference standard in the management of AVM. Absolute volume reduction from embolisation is most prominent for AVM > 10 ml and thus facilitates subsequent radiosurgery. For AVM < or = 10 ml, GKRS as the only treatment can be an alternative to primary embolisation, particularly if no significant volume reduction or obviously beneficial effect of targeted embolisation is expected. Further prospective studies are needed to identify subgroups in which one treatment has advantages over the other.",2001 Aug,2001,Acta neurochirurgica,143,8,801-10,eng,False,10.1007/s007010170034,"Comparative Study;Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Cerebral Hemorrhage/diagnosis/therapy;Child;*Embolization, Therapeutic;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/*therapy;Male;Middle Aged;Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care;Quality Assurance, Health Care;*Radiosurgery;Recurrence;Reference Values;Risk;Treatment Outcome",
15335417,Experimental radiobiological investigations into radiosurgery: present understanding and future directions.,"LARS LEKSELL BEGAN radiobiological investigations to study the effect of high-dose focused radiation on the central nervous system more than 5 decades ago. Although the effects of radiosurgery on the brain tumor microenvironment are still under investigation, radiosurgery has become a preferred management modality for many intracranial tumors and vascular malformations. The effects and the pathogenesis of biological effects after radiosurgery may be unique. The need for basic research concerning the radiobiological effects of high-dose, single-fraction, ionizing radiation on nervous system tissue is crucial. Information from those studies would be useful in devising strategies to avoid, prevent, or ameliorate damage to normal tissue without compromising treatment efficacy. The development of future applications of radiosurgery will depend on an increase in our understanding of the radiobiology of radiosurgery, which in turn will affect the efficacy of treatment.

28522380,Predictive Factors of Postoperative Seizure for Pediatric Patients with Unruptured Arteriovenous Malformations.,"BACKGROUND: Seizure is the second-most common presentation in patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and superimposes a significant burden on pediatric patients. Postoperative seizure risk in unruptured AVMs is underreported in the pediatric AVM literature. We aimed to characterize and identify predictive factors for postoperative seizures in this study. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all surgically treated pediatric patients with unruptured AVM at our institution from 2001 to 2014. Patients younger than 18 years of age were included. Baseline variables was compared against our outcome of interest, which was defined as patients with or without follow-up seizures. Multivariable Cox regression was performed to identify potential predictive factors. RESULTS: The average age of all patients was 13.1 years, and 68.2% were male. Nine patients were asymptomatic (13.6%), and seizure presentation occurred in 57.6% (n = 38). During an average follow-up of 4.2 years, 12 (18.2%) patients experienced postoperative seizures, with 5 (17.9%) of 28 patients with seizures being de novo. In patients with seizure presentation, 81.6% were completely seizure-free throughout follow-up. In multivariable analysis, larger AVM size (hazard ratio [HR] 1.63, P = 0.023) and temporal location (HR 8.35, P = 0.007) were found to increase the risk of follow-up seizures. On the contrary, seizure presentation (HR 1.91, P = 0.369) and postoperative infection (HR 2.37, P = 0.265) were not associated. CONCLUSIONS: Surgery may eliminate most seizures with low risk of inducing de novo seizures in pediatric patients with unruptured AVM. Predictive factors for postoperative seizures included large AVM size and temporal location. For selected unruptured AVMs with small size and nontemporal location, consideration of surgery as primary treatment for persistent seizures is a reasonable option.",2017 Sep,2017,World neurosurgery,105,,37-46,eng,False,S1878-8750(17)30719-2;10.1016/j.wneu.2017.05.031;S1878-8750(17)30719-2;10.1016/j.wneu.2017.05.031,Journal Article,Adolescent;Child;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;*Neurosurgical Procedures/adverse effects;*Postoperative Complications;Postoperative Period;Radiosurgery/methods;Retrospective Studies;Risk Factors;Seizures/diagnosis/*etiology;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult,Arteriovenous malformation;Pediatric;Seizures;Unruptured

There are few reports in the literature of radionecrosis and solid lesions treated with surgery.(1-4) To the authors' knowledge, this case has the longest interval between radiosurgery and the presentation of cerebral necrosis.

The magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed a lesion simulating an intra-axial tumor causing important edema and mass effect. Medical treatment was given including high-dose steroids without success, therefore microsurgery was performed. The surgery was presented in a step-by-step basis and correlation was performed with the involved adjacent anatomy, to illustrate the anatomy of the approach and surgical landmarks. The patient's symptoms resolved completely, and the postoperative magnetic resonance imaging scan showed complete resection and resolution of the edema.

30554186,Seizure control after radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations: a 25-year experience.,"OBJECTIVE: Seizures are the second-most common presenting symptom in patients with lobar arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). However, few studies have assessed the long-term effect of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) on seizure control. The authors of this study assess the outcome of SRS for these patients to identify prognostic factors associated with seizure control. METHODS: Patients with AVM who presented with a history of seizure and underwent SRS at the authors' institution between 1987 and 2012 were retrospectively assessed. The total cohort included 155 patients with a mean follow-up of 86 months (range 6-295 months). Primary outcomes assessed were seizure frequency, antiepileptic drug regimen, and seizure freedom for 6 months prior to last follow-up. RESULTS: Seizure-free status was achieved in 108 patients (70%), with an additional 23 patients (15%) reporting improved seizure frequency as compared to their pre-SRS status. The median time to seizure-free status was estimated to be 12 months (95% CI 0-27 months) as evaluated via Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The mean seizure frequency prior to SRS was 14.2 (95% CI 5.4-23.1) episodes per year. Although not all patients tried, the proportion of patients successfully weaned off all antiepileptic drugs was 18% (28/155 patients). On multivariate logistic regression, focal impaired awareness seizure type (also known as complex partial seizures) and superficial venous drainage were significantly associated with a decreased odds ratio for seizure-free status at last follow-up (OR 0.37 [95% CI 0.15-0.92] for focal impaired awareness seizures; OR 0.36 [95% CI 0.16-0.81] for superficial venous drainage). The effects of superficial venous drainage on seizure outcome were nonsignificant when excluding patients with < 2 years of follow-up. AVM obliteration did not correlate with long-term seizure freedom (p = 0.202, chi-square test). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that SRS improves long-term seizure control and increases the likelihood of being medication free, independently of AVM obliteration. Patients with focal impaired awareness seizures were less likely to obtain long-term seizure relief.",2019 Dec 1,2019,Journal of neurosurgery,131,6,1763-1772,eng,True,10.3171/2018.7.JNS18304;10.3171/2018.7.JNS18304,Journal Article,Adult;Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use;Arteriovenous Fistula/complications/*radiotherapy;Cohort Studies;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/drug therapy/*radiotherapy;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/*trends;Retrospective Studies;Seizures/drug therapy/etiology/*radiotherapy;Treatment Outcome,AED = antiepileptic drug;ARUBA = A Randomized Trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformations;AVM = arteriovenous malformation;IQR = interquartile range;RCT = randomized controlled trial;SRS = stereotactic radiosurgery;antiepileptic drugs;prognosis;risk factors;stereotactic radiosurgery;vascular disorders
22208313,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations, part 2: management of pediatric patients.","OBJECT: The authors conducted a study to define the long-term outcomes and risks of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for pediatric arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). METHODS: Between 1987 and 2006, the authors performed Gamma Knife surgery in 996 patients with brain AVMs; 135 patients were younger than 18 years of age. The median maximum diameter and target volumes were 2.0 cm (range 0.6-5.2 cm) and 2.5 cm(3) (range 0.1-17.5 cm(3)), respectively. The median margin dose was 20 Gy (range 15-25 Gy). RESULTS: The actuarial rates of total obliteration documented by angiography or MR imaging at 71.3 months (range 6-264 months) were 45%, 64%, 67%, and 72% at 3, 4, 5, and 10 years, respectively. The median time to complete angiographically documented obliteration was 48.9 months. Of 81 patients with 4 or more years of follow-up, 57 patients (70%) had total obliteration documented by angiography. Factors associated with a higher rate of documented AVM obliteration were smaller AVM target volume, smaller maximum diameter, and larger margin dose. In 8 patients (6%) a hemorrhage occurred during the latency interval, and 1 patient died. The rates of AVM hemorrhage after SRS were 0%, 1.6%, 2.4%, 5.5%, and 10.0% at 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 years, respectively. The overall annual hemorrhage rate was 1.8%. Larger volume AVMs were associated with a significantly higher risk of hemorrhage after SRS. Permanent neurological deficits due to adverse radiation effects developed in 2 patients (1.5%) after SRS, and in 1 patient (0.7%) delayed cyst formation occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic radiosurgery is a gradually effective and relatively safe management option for pediatric patients in whom surgery is considered to pose excessive risks. Although hemorrhage after AVM obliteration did not occur in the present series, patients remain at risk during the latency interval until obliteration is complete.

The goal of this paper was to study these outcomes. METHODS: Between 1990 and 2000, 56 patients underwent radiosurgery for AVMs located in the basal ganglia (10 patients), thalamus (30 patients), or brainstem (16 patients). The median age of these patients was 34.2 years. Thirty-five patients (62%) had experienced previous bleeding. The AVMs were classified Grade IIIB in 62% of patients and Grade IV in 38% according to the modified Spetzler-Martin Scale; the median radiosurgery-based AVM score was 1.83. The median volume of the lesion was 3.8 cm3 and the median radiation dose delivered to its margin was 18 Gy. The median duration of follow-up review after radiosurgery was 45 months (range 3-121 months). In seven patients (12%) hemorrhage occurred at a median of 12 months after radiosurgery; five patients (9%) died and two recovered without any deficit. Permanent radiation-related complications occurred in six (12%) of 51 patients (excluding the five patients who died of hemorrhage) after one procedure and in three (18%) of 17 patients after repeated radiosurgery. Obliteration of the AVM was noted in 24 patients (43%; obliteration was confirmed by angiography in 18 patients and by magnetic resonance [MR] imaging in six patients) after a single procedure and in 32 patients (57%; confirmed by angiography in 25 patients and by MR imaging in seven patients) after one or more procedures. Excellent outcomes (obliteration of the lesion without any new deficit) were obtained in 39% of patients after one radiosurgical procedure and in 48% after one or more procedures. Twelve (67%) of 18 patients with AVM scores lower than 1.5 had excellent outcomes compared with 15 (39%) of 38 patients with AVM scores greater than 1.5 (p = 0.053). CONCLUSIONS: Less than half of the patients with deeply located AVMs were cured of the future risk of hemorrhage without new neurological deficits. This experience emphasizes the difficulty in treating patients with deeply located AVMs; the majority of whom are also poor candidates for resection or embolization.",2004 Feb,2004,Journal of neurosurgery,100,2,210-4,eng,True,10.3171/jns.2004.100.2.0210,Journal Article,Adult;Basal Ganglia/surgery;Brain Stem/surgery;Cerebral Hemorrhage/*etiology;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/radiotherapy/*surgery;Male;Radiation Injuries/*etiology;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects;Thalamus/surgery;Treatment Outcome,

Early occlusion of the draining veins has been postulated as one of the rare causes of complications after GKRS, which often occurs at or beyond 6 months after GKRS. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: We present a very rare incidence of acute onset of hemiparesis caused by a draining vein occlusion within 24 hours after GKRS for arteriovenous malformation. The patient developed hemiparesis within one day after GKRS, which partially improved with steroids. Radiologic investigations revealed an early occlusion of a draining vein, resulting in occlusive hyperemia and neurologic deficit. CONCLUSION: Early draining vein occlusion is an important cause of postradiosurgery complications, and it can rarely occur within days.",2013 Dec,2013,"Journal of neurological surgery.

Although embolization has been widely performed as a stand-alone procedure to cure brain AVM, it is undermined whether patients benefit from this treatment. This study aimed to compare the long-term outcome of hemorrhagic stroke or death in patients with either conservative management or stand-alone embolization for AVM. METHODS: The study population was derived from a nationwide multicenter prospective collaboration registry (the MATCH registry) between August 2011 and August 2021. The propensity score-matched survival analysis was performed in the overall and stratified AVM cases (unruptured and ruptured), respectively, to compare the long-term outcome of hemorrhagic stroke or death, and neurological status. The efficacy of distinct embolization strategies was also evaluated. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CI were calculated using Fine-Gray competing risk models. RESULTS: Of the 3682 consecutive AVMs, 906 underwent either conservative management or embolization as the stand-alone management strategy. After propensity score matching, a total of 622 (311 pairs) patients constituted an overall cohort. The unruptured and ruptured subgroups were composed of 288 cases (144 pairs) and 252 cases (126 pairs), respectively. In the overall cohort, embolization did not prevent long-term hemorrhagic stroke or death compared with conservative management [2.07 vs. 1.57 per 100 patient-years; HR, 1.28 (95% CI, 0.81-2.04)]. Similar results were maintained in both unruptured AVMs [1.97 vs. 0.93 per 100 patient-years; HR, 2.09 (95% CI, 0.99-4.41)] and ruptured AVMs [2.36 vs. 2.57 per 100 patient-years; HR, 0.76 (95% CI, 0.39-1.48)]. Stratified analysis showed that the target embolization might be beneficial for unruptured AVMs [HR, 0.42 (95% CI, 0.08-2.29)], while the curative embolization improved the outcome of ruptured AVMs [HR, 0.29 (95% CI, 0.10-0.87)]. The long-term neurological status was similar between these two strategies.

11404703,[Prospects and future: evolution of stereotactic methodology for planning].,"We have been using the stereotactic methodology of Talairach for Linac radiosurgery of cerebral arteriovenous malformations since 1984, and updated it with addition of CT and MR images into the stereotactic space. The target remains defined, as in most other centers, by stereotactic angiography. However, tridimensional configuration of cerebral arteriovenous malformations is better defined using MR or CT-angiography. Therefore, pre-radiosurgical imaging tends to combine multimodal images oriented into the stereotactic space. Frame-based radiosurgery, with invasive frame placement, will be replaced in the future by frameless irradiation with real-time tracking of the patients head, as performed by the recently described Cyber-knife. Intraoperative X-ray will be no longer long-distance fixed equipments but mobile, short-distance fluoroscopic systems integrated in the surgical workstation environment.

24418791,Long-term outcomes of gamma knife surgery for posterior fossa arteriovenous malformations.,The long-term outcomes of gamma knife surgery (GKS) in patients with posterior fossa arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) were retrospectively analyzed in 82 patients followed up for more than 5 years to evaluate the efficacy and safety. The median AVM volume at GKS was 0.95 cm(3). The prescribed dose to the AVM margin was median 18 Gy with 1-18 isocenters. The actual complete AVM obliteration rate was 58.5% at 3 years and 78.0% at 5 years. The significant factors for higher complete obliteration rate were younger patient age and smaller maximum/minimum nidus diameter ratio. Two patients experienced hemorrhage caused by residual AVM rupture at 4 and 49 months. Twenty patients developed peri-nidal edema as an adverse radiation-induced reaction at median 13 months. One patient developed radiationinduced necrosis at 6.8 years. Neurological complication was observed in 12 patients and 6 patients remained with neurological dysfunction permanently. Larger nidus volume and location adjacent to an eloquent area significantly increased the risk of neurological complication. Pittsburgh radiosurgery-based AVM grading scale was significantly correlated with the outcome of neurological symptoms after GKS. GKS achieved acceptable and complete obliteration rate for posterior fossa AVM with relatively low risk of morbidity on neuroimaging and neurological symptoms for the long-term period after treatment. We recommend conformable and selective treatment planning to achieve both obliteration of the AVM nidus and preservation of neurological function.,2014,2014,Neurologia medico-chirurgica,54,10,799-805,eng,True,DN/JST.JSTAGE/nmc/oa.2013-0090;nmc-54-799;10.2176/nmc.oa.2013-0090,Journal Article,"Adult;Aged;Cranial Fossa, Posterior/surgery;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;*Radiosurgery;Treatment Outcome",
35901718,Operative considerations and surgical treatment of sylvian fissure arteriovenous malformations: a 20-year experience.,"OBJECTIVE: Sylvian fissure (SF) arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are among the most challenging vascular lesions amenable to neurosurgical treatment and account for 10% of all locations. As radiosurgery and endovascular techniques are increasingly involved in multimodal management protocols, the role of microsurgery needs to be reassessed as a stand-alone technique. The aim of this study was to show that total excision can be achieved with reasonable levels of morbidity and mortality in a real-world setting from a specialized high-volume center. METHODS: Forty-three patients with SF AVMs were identified from a series of 577 AVM patients treated microsurgically over a 22-year period. The mean patient age was 33.07 years (range 15-60 years), and there were 22 male and 21 female patients. The mode of presentation was headache in 51.2%, hemorrhage in 34.9%, seizures in 30.2%, and steal phenomenon in 9.3%. The authors analyzed the anatomical basis and angiographic characteristics of such lesions. RESULTS: In the preoperative period, 83.7% of the patients had a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-2, and 16.3% had an mRS score of 3-5. After a 12-month follow-up, 95.3% of patients had an mRS score of 0-2, and 4.7% had a score of 3-6. The difference between pre- and postoperative scores was not statistically significant. SF AVMs have several particular features: 1) They produce angiographic steal of the anterior cerebral artery. 2) The nidus is fed by only one of the main trunks of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). 3) Participation of deep perforators is uncommon. 4) They have two or more early draining veins showing their fistulous nature. 5) Preoperative embolization and radiosurgery have a low rate of permanent cure. CONCLUSIONS: These AVMs represent a surgical challenge due to their proximity to critical structures such as the MCA, insula, internal capsule, and speech and memory functions in the dominant hemisphere. Essential key points are the wide opening of the SF and proper differentiation between feeders and normal vessels. Although this location can seem daunting, SF AVMs carry no additional surgical risk if adequately managed.",2022 Jul,2022,Neurosurgical focus,53,1,E10,eng,False,10.3171/2022.4.FOCUS22109;10.3171/2022.4.FOCUS22109,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Embolization, Therapeutic/methods;Female;Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/surgery;Male;Microsurgery/methods;Middle Aged;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",arteriovenous malformations;microsurgery;surgical treatment;sylvian fissure;vascular malformations

11310368,Microsurgical treatment of deep arteriovenous malformations--basal ganglia and thalamus.,"BACKGROUND: Surgery for deep nuclei arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is controversial after the introduction of stereotactic irradiation and embolization. However, rupture of an AVM in this location can lead to catastrophic parenchymal or intraventricular hemorrhage. Thus, microsurgery still has its place in treatment of such lesions to prevent the untreated AVM bleeding or rebleeding. We present a series of 16 AVMs located in the deep nuclei treated by direct microsurgery before radiosurgery was available in 1993. METHODS: We reviewed the clinical and angiographic characteristic of 16 patients with deep-seated AVMs (three in caudate nucleus, three in lentiform nucleus and ten in thalamus). The surgical approach was described separately depending upon the location of the AVMs. The surgical outcomes were classified as excellent (symptoms improved), good (no additional neurological deficit), fair (minor neurological deficit), bad (major neurological deficit) and dead. RESULTS: Complete AVM elimination was achieved in 16 patients (100%) in one-stage operation. Eleven patients had excellent or good outcomes, three had fair outcomes and two had bad outcomes. There were no deaths in this series. Two patients had permanent hemiparesis to make a late morbidity rate of 12.5%.

20561494,Diagnosis and management of arteriovenous malformations in children.,"Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is the most common cause of spontaneous intraparenchymal hemorrhage in children, excluding hemorrhages of prematurity and early infancy. Because most children diagnosed with an AVM undergo initial treatment emergently, the natural history of AVMs in the pediatric population is not well understood. Most pediatric AVMs do not come to clinical attention unless they hemorrhage. Therefore, their optimal management remains controversial. Children with intracranial AVMs represent a special challenge in that they harbor unacceptable lifelong risks of hemorrhage and potential neurologic deficits. Patients should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine the best multidisciplinary treatment regimen that can be used to preserve neurologic function and eradicate the AVM with the lowest risk of mortality. Successful treatment depends on the location and size of the AVM, its hemodynamic properties, the clinical condition of the patient, and the treatment modality selected. The armamentarium for AVM management has grown with technological advances and now includes microsurgical resection, endovascular embolization, radiosurgery, or any combination of these modalities. Microsurgical resection remains the gold standard for treatment of accessible pediatric AVMs, especially in cases that present with intracranial hemorrhage. Newer modalities, such as embolization and radiosurgery, have provided additional tools to help children with large or deep-seated lesions that would be deemed unresectable with microsurgical techniques alone.

32629471,Visual Field Defect Before and After Endovascular Treatment of Occipital Arteriovenous Malformations.,"BACKGROUND: Occipital arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) carry a high risk of postoperative morbidity because of their anatomic relation to the visual cortex and optic radiations. Data regarding endovascular management of these lesions are scant. OBJECTIVE: To report our single-center experience with occipital AVMs, most of which were treated endovascularly, with a special interest for postoperative visual impairment. METHODS: From a prospective database, we assessed the clinical and radiological data of all patients with an occipital AVM managed between 1997 and 2018. The extension of the nidus to the primary visual cortex was assessed and correlated to the pre- and postintervention visual symptomatology. Modified Rankin Scale and visual fields (VFs) were assessed pre- and post-treatment and at the last follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 83 patients (47 males [56.6%]) with an occipital AVM were included in the study. Mean age at presentation was 33.5 ± 15.0 yr (min-max = 7-76). A total of 34 patients (41%) presented with hemorrhage related to the AVM. A total of 57 patients (68.7%) underwent endovascular treatment (EVT) alone, 20 (24.1%) underwent embolization and surgery, 3 (3.6%) underwent embolization and radiosurgery, and 3 (3.6%) were conservatively managed. A complete obliteration of the AVM was achieved in 53 patients (66.3%). A post-treatment worsening of the VF was found in 24 of the treated patients (30%), 3 patients (9%) for ruptured AVMs, and in 21 patients (46%) for unruptured AVMs. Morbidity rate was 3.7% and mortality rate was 2.5%.

22622226,[Stereotactic intracranial radiotherapy: dose prescription].,"The aim of this article was the study of the successive steps permitting the prescription of dose in stereotactic intracranial radiotherapy, which includes radiosurgery and fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy. The successive steps studied are: the choice of stereotactic intracranial radiotherapy among the therapeutic options, based on curative or palliative treatment intent, then the selection of lesions according to size/volume, pathological type and their number permitting the choice between radiosurgery or fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy, which have the same methodological basis. Clinical experience has determined the level of dose to treat the lesions and limit the irradiation of healthy adjacent tissues and organs at risk structures. The last step is the optimization of the different parameters to obtain a safe compromise between the lesion dose and healthy adjacent structures. Study of dose-volume histograms, coverage indices and 3D imaging permit the optimization of irradiation. For lesions close to or included in a critical area, the prescribed dose is planned using the inverse planification method. Implementation of the successively described steps is mandatory to insure the prescription of an optimized dose. The whole procedure is based on the delineation of the lesion and adjacent healthy tissues. There are sometimes difficulties to assess the delineation and the volume of the target, however improvement of local control rates and reduction of secondary effects are the proof that the totality of the successive procedures are progressively improved.

23403354,An updated assessment of the risk of radiation-induced neoplasia after radiosurgery of arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVE: Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) is a minimally invasive technique employed in the treatment of intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Patients experience a low incidence of complications following treatment. As long-term follow-up data became available, some late adverse effects have been reported. However, the exact incidence of radiosurgically induced neoplasia is not known. METHODS: At University of Virginia, imaging and clinical outcomes of 1309 patients with intracranial AVMs treated with GKRS have been reviewed. AVM patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) every 6 months for 2 years and then annually following GKRS. When the nidi were no longer visible on magnetic resonance imaging, angiography was performed to verify the obliteration of AVMs. Patients were thereafter recommended to continue MRIs every 3-5 years to detect any long-term complications. A subset of 812, 358, and 78 patients had neuroimaging and clinical follow-up of at least 3, 10, and 15 years, respectively. RESULTS: The authors report the occurrence of 3 cases of radiosurgically induced neoplasia. More than 10 years after GKRS, 2 patients were found to have an incidental, uniformly enhancing, dural-based mass lesion near the site of the AVM with radiologic characteristics of a meningioma. As the lesions have shown no evidence of mass effect, they are being followed with serial neuroimaging. A third patient was found to have neurologic decline from a tumor in immediate proximity to an AVM previously treated with proton beam radiosurgery and GKRS. The patient underwent resection, demonstrating a high-grade glioma. The 3-, 10-, and 15-year incidence of a radiation-induced tumor is 0% (0/812), 0.3% (1/358), and 2.6% (2/78), respectively. The cumulative rate of radiosurgically induced tumors in those with a minimum of 10-year follow-up is 3 in 4692 person-years or 64 in 100,000 person-years. Thus, patients had a 0.64% chance of developing a radiation-induced tumor within ≥10 years following GKRS. If we calculate rates based on a subset of 78 patients with neuroimaging and clinical follow-up of ≤15 years, the cumulative rate was 3.4%. These are the second, third, and fifth reported cases of radiation-induced tumors following GKRS for an AVM. CONCLUSIONS: Although radiosurgery is generally considered a safe modality in the treatment of AVMs, radiation-induced neoplasia is a rare but serious adverse event. The possibility of GKRS-induced tumors underscores the necessity of long-term follow-up in AVM patients receiving radiosurgery.",2014 Sep-Oct,2014,World neurosurgery,82,3-4,395-401,eng,False,S1878-8750(13)00273-8;10.1016/j.wneu.2013.02.008;S1878-8750(13)00273-8;10.1016/j.wneu.2013.02.008,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Child;Child, Preschool;Embolization, Therapeutic;Female;Humans;Infant;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*complications/*surgery;Male;Meningioma/etiology;Middle Aged;Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology;Postoperative Complications/*epidemiology;Radiation Dosage;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects;Risk Assessment;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",Arteriovenous malformation;Complication;Gamma knife;Radiosurgery;Tumor
21990795,Microsurgical retrieval of an endovascular microcatheter trapped during Onyx embolization of a cerebral arteriovenous malformation.,"OBJECTIVE: Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are vascular lesions that are amenable to various treatment modalities including stereotactic radiosurgery, fractionated radiotherapy, endovascular embolization, microsurgical obliteration or combined modality treatment. A potential complication of endovascular therapy with embolization material is microcatheter entrapment. We report on a patient for whom surgery was combined with endovascular embolization to obliterate an AVM and retrieve an entrapped endovascular microcatheter. PARTICIPANT: A 52-year-old woman suffered a left parietal hemorrhage from an AVM. She underwent staged endovascular embolization of the lesion using Onyx material. During the second stage of the embolization, the microcatheter (Marathon Flow Directed Microcatheter; eV3 Neurovascular, Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) was retained in the Onyx plug. It was decided to section the microcatheter at the groin and proceed with microsurgical obliteration of the AVM, with removal of the entrapped microcatheter remnant. INTERVENTION: The AVM was dissected circumferentially allowing the meticulous obliteration of the feeding vessels. A single remaining feeding vessel originating from the distal anterior cerebral artery was identified and suspected to contain the entrapped microcatheter. The location was confirmed using stereotactic guidance (BrainLab, Munich, Germany) and the vessel was then sectioned allowing complete removal of the AVM. The microcatheter (102 cm) was then extracted cranially using gentle traction.

11794608,A proposed radiosurgery-based grading system for arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECT: Radiosurgery is an effective treatment strategy for properly selected patients harboring arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Grading scales that are currently used to predict patient outcomes after AVM resection are unreliable tools for the prediction of the results of AVM radiosurgery. METHODS: A grading system was developed to predict outcomes following AVM radiosurgery, based on the multivariate analysis of data obtained in 220 patients treated between 1987 and 1991 (Group 1). The dependent variable in all analyses was excellent patient outcome (complete AVM obliteration without any new neurological deficit). The grading scale was tested on a separate set of 136 patients with AVMs treated between 1990 and 1996 at a different center (Group 2). One hundred twenty-one (55%) of 220 Group 1 patients had excellent outcomes. Multivariate analysis identified five variables related to excellent patient outcomes: AVM volume (p = 0.001), patient age (p < 0.001), AVM location (p < 0.001), previous embolization (p = 0.02), and number of draining veins (p < 0.001). Regression analysis modeling permitted removal of two significant variables (previous embolization and number of draining veins) and resulted in the following equation to predict patient outcomes after AVM radiosurgery: AVM score = (0.1)(AVM volume in cm3) + (0.02)(patient age in years) + (0.3)(location of lesion: frontal or temporal) = 0; parietal, occipital, intraventricular, corpus callosum, cerebellar = 1; or basal ganglia, thalamic, or brainstem = 2). Seventy-nine (58%) of 136 Group 2 patients had excellent outcomes. All variables in the model remained significant for the Group 2 patients: AVM volume (p = 0.01), patient age (p = 0.01), and AVM location (p < 0.001). Testing of the entire model on the Group 2 patients demonstrated that the AVM score could be used to predict patient outcomes after radiosurgery (p < 0.0001). All patients with an AVM score of 1 or lower had an excellent outcome compared with only 39% of patients with an AVM score higher than 2. The Spetzler-Martin grade (p = 0.13), the K index (p = 0.26), and the obliteration prediction index (p = 0.21) did not correlate with excellent patient outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Despite significant differences in preoperative patient characteristics and dose prescription guidelines at the two centers, the proposed AVM grading system strongly correlated with patient outcomes after single-session radiosurgery for both patient groups. Although further testing of this model by independent centers using prospective methodology is still required, this system allows a more accurate prediction of outcomes from radiosurgery to guide choices between surgical and radiosurgical management for individual patients with AVMs.",2002 Jan,2002,Journal of neurosurgery,96,1,79-85,eng,False,10.3171/jns.2002.96.1.0079,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Cerebral Angiography;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/classification/diagnostic;Male;Middle Aged;Postoperative Complications/*diagnostic imaging;Prognosis;*Radiosurgery;Treatment Outcome",
28552156,Seizures associated with cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"Various types of seizures and epilepsy are associated with 20-45% of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). The necessity to differentiate between occasional seizures, epilepsy with repetitive seizures, and the much rarer drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) is underlined. It is clear that where there is frequent seizures or DRE, vascular surgeons should take epilepsy surgery aspects into account. The epidemiology of AVM-associated seizures, assumed pathophysiologic mechanisms, most frequent seizures types, and medical treatment are described. Depending on the severity of the epilepsy, the diagnostic workup, including electroencephalogram (EEG), video-EEG, and, rarely, invasive evaluation, is explained. An invasive presurgical workup is only necessary in rare cases of DRE. The indication to extend the resection to more than just removal of the AVM is defined and the various specific resection techniques for this rare form are outlined. In the vast majority of AVM cases removal of the AVM with some adjoining gliotic or hemosiderotic rim of cortex will be sufficient, however. In the majority of cases with preoperative epilepsy, patients will be seizure-free after surgery. Patients who never had a seizure before AVM removal may develop de novo epilepsy postoperatively (5-15%).

11417414,The role of gamma knife radiosurgery in children.,"OBJECTS: Despite advances in microneurosurgery, the surgical management of deep-seated lesions is still associated with a high risk. Gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS), however, has improved the outcome of cerebral tumors and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in delicate areas. METHODS: Between March 1992 and June 1998, 50 children (age 1-16 years) with intracranial lesions were treated with GKRS. There were 12 low-grade gliomas, 12 high-grade gliomas, 7 craniopharyngiomas, 3 hamartomas, 2 meningiomas of the skull base, 2 vestibular schwannomas, 1 pituitary adenoma, 1 choroid plexus papilloma, and 10 AVMs. The mean size of the pathologies was 4.6 cm3 (range: 0.21-25.5 cm3). A mean marginal dose of 16 Gy (8-25 Gy) was applied to a mean isodose surface of 50% (35-90%). Clinical and neuroradiological follow-up were analyzed for outcome. Follow-up periods of 45 of these patients ranged from 8 to 79 months (mean 36 months); 5 patients were lost to follow-up. Neoplasms decreased in size in 15 cases (41%), remained unchanged in 13 patients (35%), and increased in 9 cases (24%). AVMs obliterated in 3 children (38%) within 24 months. Neurological follow-up demonstrated improved clinical status in 7 patients (15.5%), stable neurological status in 31 cases (69%) and clinical deterioration in 7 patients (15.5%). The treatment was well tolerated and no complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS: GKRS represents a safe and effective treatment option for benign neoplasms or AVMs in pediatric patients and may extend survival times of children with malignant lesions.",2001 May,2001,Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for,17,6,341-6; discussion 347,eng,False,10.1007/s003810000435,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Brain Neoplasms/*surgery;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Infant;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;Neurologic Examination;Postoperative Complications/diagnosis;*Radiosurgery",

Part II: Differences in obliteration rates, treatment-obliteration intervals, and prognostic factors.","PURPOSE: To evaluate and compare obliteration rates (OBRs) and treatment-obliteration intervals (TOIs) for cerebral arteriovenous malformations (cAVMs) treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery in children/adolescents and adults; and to determine factors predicting the OBR and TOI in these two populations. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This study concerned 62 children/adolescents and 193 adults observed for > or = 3 years. Fisher exact two-tailed and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, multiple logistics, and Cox proportional hazard models were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The overall OBR was 85.5% in children/adolescents and 87.6% in adults (p = 0.671), but children/adolescents showed higher 36-month actuarial OBRs (69.35%) and shorter median TOIs (25.7 months) than adults (66.84% and 28.2 months; p = 0.006 and p = 0.017, respectively). In children/adolescents, lower Spetzler-Martin grades (p = 0.043) and younger age (p = 0.019) correlated significantly with OBRs, and lower Spetzler-Martin grades (p = 0.024) and noneloquent cAVM locations (p = 0.046) with TOIs. In adults, low flow through the cAVM and < 6.2-cm3 volume were associated with both OBR and TOI (p = 0.012 and p = 0.002, respectively).

25753234,"Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformations and Epilepsy, Part 1: Predictors of Seizure Presentation.","OBJECTIVE: Seizures are relatively common in patients harboring cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Because the pathogenesis of AVM-associated epilepsy is not well-defined, we aim to determine the factors associated with seizure presentation in AVM patients. METHODS: We evaluated our institutional AVM radiosurgery database, from 1989-2013, to select patients in whom pertinent clinical information at presentation and adequate clinical and radiologic follow-up was available. Baseline patient demographics and AVM angioarchitectural features were compared between patients with and without seizure presentation. In addition to standard descriptive statistics, logistic regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of seizure presentation. RESULTS: Of the 1007 AVM patients included for analysis, 229 patients presented with seizures (22.7%). The incidence of seizure presentation was significantly higher in cortical than noncortical AVMs (33.1% vs. 6.6%, P < 0.0001). Among the cortical locations, occipital AVMs had the lowest rate of seizure presentation (21.5%, P = 0.0012), whereas the rates of seizure presentation in frontal (37.3%), temporal (37.7%), and parietal (34.0%) AVMs were similar. The lack of prior AVM hemorrhage (P < 0.0001), larger nidus diameter (P < 0.0001), and cortical location (P < 0.0001) were independent predictors of seizure presentation in the multivariate analysis. The strongest independent predictors of seizure presentation were lack of prior AVM hemorrhage (OR 16.8) and cortical location (OR 4.2). CONCLUSIONS: Large, unruptured, cortical nidi are most prone to seizure presentation in patients referred for radiosurgery.

21039165,Gamma Knife surgery for arteriovenous malformations in children.,"OBJECT: The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term imaging and clinical outcomes of intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in children treated with Gamma Knife surgery (GKS). METHODS: Between 1989 and 2007, 200 patients with AVMs who were 18 years of age or younger were treated at the University of Virginia Health System. Excluding 14 patients who had not reached 2-year follow-up, 186 patients comprised this study. Hemorrhage was the most common presenting symptom leading to the diagnosis of AVMs (71.5%). The mean nidus volume was 3.2 cm(3) at the time of GKS, and a mean prescription dose of 21.9 Gy was used. RESULTS: After initial GKS, 49.5% of patients achieved total angiographic obliteration. Forty-one patients whose AVM nidi remained patent underwent additional GKS. The obliteration rate increased to 58.6% after a second or multiple GKS. Subtotal obliteration was achieved in 9 patients (4.8%). Forty-nine patients (26.3%) still had a patent residual nidus. In 19 patients (10.2%), obliteration was confirmed on MR imaging only. Ten patients had 17 hemorrhages during the follow-up period. The hemorrhage rate was 5.4% within 2 years after GKS and 0.8% between 2 and 5 years. Six patients developed neurological deficits along with the radiation-induced changes. Two patients developed asymptomatic meningiomas 10 and 12 years after GKS. After a mean clinical follow-up of 98 months, less than 4% of patients had difficulty attending school or developing a career. CONCLUSIONS: Gamma Knife surgery offers a reasonable chance of obliteration of an AVM in pediatric patients. The incidence of symptomatic radiation-induced changes is relatively low; however, long-term clinical and imaging follow-up is required to identify delayed cyst formation and secondary tumors.",2010 Nov,2010,Journal of neurosurgery.

Case report.,"The purpose of this study was to analyze immunohistochemical characteristics of the cell population in a radiosurgically obliterated cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) after recurrent hemorrhage. Immunohistochemical reactions were carried out on paraffin-embedded histological sections for von Willebrand factor (FVIII), CD34 endothelial antigen (CD34), vimentin and alpha-smooth-muscle actin (SMA) cytoskeletal proteins. Histopathological analysis revealed that the majority of AVM channels were replaced by hypocellular scar tissue. However some of them still disclosed thrombus organization by granulation tissue seven years after radiosurgery. FVIII and CD34 reactions revealed vessel neoformation in thromboses. Proliferating spindle-shaped cells with SMA and vimentin expression were identified in the granulation tissue. These histopathological findings suggest the role of re-canalization in recurrence of hemorrhage following radiosurgical obliteration of the AVM.

11897302,Arteriovenous malformations.,"Arteriovenous malformations of the brain are congenital vascular lesions that affect 0.01-0.50% of the population, and are generally present in patients aged 20-40 years. The usual clinical presentations are haemorrhage, seizures, progressive neurological deficit, or headache. Results of natural history studies have shown a yearly haemorrhage rate of 1-4%. Frequency of rebleeding has increased over the years, and several factors that increase risk of haemorrhage have been identified. Although substantial, the morbidity associated with haemorrhages could be less than previously thought. Over the past decade, great advances have been made in application of endovascular embolisation techniques, stereotactic radiosurgery, and microsurgery, allowing effective multidisciplinary treatment of arteriovenous malformations, including those previously deemed to be untreatable. Increasing attention has been paid to management of flow-related aneurysms associated with these malformations.

17318004,Physiological and pathological observations on rat middle cerebral arteries and human AVM tissue cultures following single high-dose gamma irradiation.,"In vitro isometric myograph and histopathological studies were performed on rat middle cerebral arteries (MCAs) to explore changes in contractile capacity following experimental Gamma Knife radiosurgery. Right MCAs were treated with 25 Gy and 50 Gy at the 50% isodose line, while contralateral vessels received 15 Gy and 20 Gy at the 20% isodose region. Survival period varied from 3 to 18 months. Reduction in contractile capacity of irradiated normal rat MCAs was detected but their lumina remained patent. In another study, we investigated human AVM tissue cultures in order to detect genetic and phenotypic modifications contributing to vessel occlusion after irradiation. In culture, the proliferation index decreased considerably following 15-, 20-, 25- or 50-Gy irradiation at the 5th posttreatment day and remained depressed during the observation period of 14 days. P53, p21Waf-1 and mdm-2 mRNA contents were elevated significantly after irradiation, indicating enhanced apoptosis. Immunohistochemistry revealed vigorous vimentin positivity in the nonirradiated control AVM cultures, which gradually decreased by the time in the irradiated specimens. Smooth muscle alpha-actin positivity was prominent in the irradiated cultivated samples, suggesting transformation of resting fibroblasts onto activated myofibroblastic elements with contractile capacity. This transformation process was confirmed by the appearance of TGF-Beta in the irradiated AVM cell lines also. These data support the hypothesis that one of the contributing factors to AVM shrinkage and obliteration after radiosurgery might be fibrocyte-myofibroblastic cell transformation in the vessel wall.",2007,2007,Progress in neurological surgery,20,,375-387,eng,False,10.1159/000100179;000100179;10.1159/000100179,Journal Article,"Animals;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*pathology/*physiopathology/*surgery;Middle Cerebral Artery/drug effects/*pathology/*physiology/radiation effects;Models, Animal;Necrosis;Potassium Chloride/pharmacology;Prostaglandins F/pharmacology;Radiosurgery/methods;Rats;Rats, Wistar;Tissue Culture Techniques;Uridine Triphosphate/pharmacology",
33246903,Long term treatment efficacy & complications of hypofractionated stereotactic radiosurgery in brain arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate long term treatment efficacy and complications of hypofractionated stereotactic radiosurgery (hfSRS) and identify factors that predict outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted on 34 consecutive patients who received hfSRS from 2008 to 2017. Demographic, clinical, angio-architectural characteristics, and radiosurgery data were extracted from the Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System and our unit's iPlan (BrainLAB, Munich) system. Data was analysed using SPSS. RESULTS: 5-year obliteration rate was 39.1%. Most patients (n = 29, 85.3%) recovered well with GOS of 4-5. 26.9% (n = 9) patients have at least one post-radiosurgery complication including hemorrhage, neurological deficits, radionecrosis. Neurological morbidity and mortality was 17.6% (n = 6). A higher modified radiosurgery arteriovenous malformation score (mRBAS) is associated with a lower 5-year obliteration rate (Rho = -0.486, p = 0.025). None of the bAVM were obliterated once mRBAS exceeds 5.35. As expected, a larger 20-Gy volume outside lesion is associated with more complications and poorer GOS. Interestingly, irradiated drainage vein volume indexed to AVM volume (iiDVV) correlates with increased risks of post-hfSRS haemorrhage (Rho = 0.472, p = 0.031) and reduced event-free survival (Rho = -0.472, p = 0.031). Once iiDVV exceeds 20%, a high rebleeding rate after hfSRS is anticipated (AUC under ROC 0.889). CONCLUSION: Hypofractionated stereotactic radiosurgery is an alternative radiosurgery treatment for bAVM unsuitable for single-fraction SRS. mRBAS predicts obliteration rate and morbidity in hfSRS. Index irradiated drainage vein volume (iiDVV) is associated with event-free survival and rebleeding and should be minimized if feasible.",2020 Dec,2020,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society,82,Pt B,241-246,eng,False,S0967-5868(20)31616-7;10.1016/j.jocn.2020.10.057;S0967-5868(20)31616-7;10.1016/j.jocn.2020.10.057,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Brain/pathology;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Progression-Free Survival;Radiation Injuries/*complications;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",Arteriovenous malformation;Drainage vein;Drainage vein volume;Hypofractionated stereotactic radiosurgery;Radiosurgery score
32707557,Biologically effective dose and prediction of obliteration of unruptured arteriovenous malformations treated by upfront Gamma Knife radiosurgery: a series of 149 consecutive cases.,"OBJECTIVE: Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) present no pathologic tissue, and radiation dose is confined in a clear targeted volume. The authors retrospectively evaluated the role of the biologically effective dose (BED) after Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for brain AVMs. METHODS: A total of 149 consecutive cases of unruptured AVMs treated by upfront GKRS in Lille University Hospital, France, were included. The mean length of follow-up was 52.9 months (median 48, range 12-154 months). The primary outcome was obliteration, and the secondary outcome was complication appearance. The marginal dose was 24 Gy in a vast majority of cases (n = 115, 77.2%; range 18-25 Gy). The mean BED was 220.1 Gy2.47 (median 229.9, range 106.7-246.8 Gy2.47). The mean beam-on time was 32.3 minutes (median 30.8, range 9-138.7 minutes). In the present series, the mean radiation dose rate was 2.259 Gy/min (median 2.176, range 1.313-3.665 Gy/min). The Virginia score was 0 in 29 (19.5%), 1 in 61 (40.9%), 2 in 41 (27.5%), 3 in 18 (12.1%), and 4 in 0 (0%) patients, respectively. The mean Pollock-Flickinger score was 1.11 (median 1.52, range 0.4-2.9). Univariate (for obliteration and complication appearance) and multivariate (for obliteration only) analyses were performed. RESULTS: A total of 104 AVMs (69.8%) were obliterated at the last follow-up. The strongest predictor for obliteration was BED (p = 0.03). A radiosurgical obliteration score is proposed, derived from a fitted multivariable model: (0.018 × BED) + (1.58 × V12) + (-0.013689 × beam-on time) + (0.021 × age) - 4.38. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.7438; after internal validation using bootstrap methods, it was 0.7088. No statistically significant relationship between radiation dose rate and obliteration was found (p = 0.29). Twenty-eight (18.8%) patients developed complications after GKRS; 20 (13.4%) of these patients had transient adverse radiological effects (perilesional edema developed). Predictors for complication appearance were higher prescription isodose volume (p = 0.005) and 12-Gy isodose line volume (V12; p = 0.001), higher Pollock-Flickinger (p = 0.02) and Virginia scores (p = 0.003), and lower beam-on time (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The BED was the strongest predictor of obliteration of unruptured AVMs after upfront GKRS. A radiosurgical score comprising the BED is proposed. The V12 appears as a predictor for both efficacy and toxicity. Beam-on time was illustrated as statistically significant for both obliteration and complication appearance. The radiation dose rate did not influence obliteration in the current analysis. The exact BED threshold remains to be established by further studies.",2021 Jun 1,2021,Journal of neurosurgery,134,6,1901-1911,eng,True,10.3171/2020.4.JNS201250;10.3171/2020.4.JNS201250,Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Arteriovenous Fistula/diagnosis/*epidemiology/*radiotherapy;Female;Follow-Up Studies;France/epidemiology;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/*epidemiology/*radiotherapy;Male;Middle Aged;Predictive Value of Tests;*Radiation Dosage;Radiosurgery/*methods;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult,Gamma Knife;biologically effective dose;obliteration;score;stereotactic radiosurgery;vascular disorders
22623087,Management of ruptured brain arteriovenous malformations.,"Intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are a common cause of stroke in younger patients, and often present as intracerebral hemorrhages (ICH), associated with 10 % to 30 % mortality. Patients who present with a hemorrhage from an AVM should be initially stabilized according to acute management guidelines for ICH. The characteristics of a lesion including its size, location in eloquent tissue, and high-risk features will influence risk of rupture, prognosis, as well as help guide management decisions. Given that rupture is associated with an increased risk of 6 % re-rupture in the year following the initial hemorrhage, versus 1 % to 3 % predicted annual risk in non-ruptured lesions only, definitive treatment is encouraged after ICH stabilization. A rest period of 2 to 6 weeks after hemorrhage is recommended before definitive treatment to avoid disrupting friable parenchyma and the hematoma. Treatment may consist of endovascular embolization, surgical resection, radiosurgery, or a combination of these three interventions based on the lesion.",2012 Aug,2012,Current atherosclerosis reports,14,4,335-42,eng,False,10.1007/s11883-012-0257-9;10.1007/s11883-012-0257-9,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't;Review","Antihypertensive Agents/*therapeutic use;Arteriovenous Fistula/complications/*therapy;Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology/*therapy;Coagulants/*therapeutic use;Embolization, Therapeutic/*methods;Endovascular Procedures/*methods;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/*therapy;Neurosurgical Procedures/*methods;Radiosurgery/*methods;Rupture, Spontaneous",
25434957,Hemorrhage during pregnancy in the latency interval after stereotactic radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECT: The presentation for patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is often intracranial hemorrhage; for women, this frequently occurs during the prime childbearing years. Although previous studies have addressed the risk for AVM hemorrhage during pregnancy, such studies have not assessed the risk for hemorrhage among women who become pregnant during the latency interval between stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and documented obliteration of the lesion. The authors sought to evaluate the risk for hemorrhage in patients who become pregnant during the latency interval after SRS. METHODS: This single-institution retrospective analysis reviewed the authors' experience with Gamma Knife SRS during 1987-2012. During this time, 253 women of childbearing age (median age 30 years, range 15-40 years) underwent SRS for intracranial AVM. The median target volume was 3.9 cm(3) (range 0.1-27.1 cm(3)), and the median marginal dose was 20 Gy (range 14-38 Gy). For all patients, the date of AVM obliteration was recorded and the latency interval was calculated. Information about subsequent pregnancies and/or bleeding events during the latency interval was retrieved from the medical records and supplemented by telephone contact. RESULTS: AVM obliteration was confirmed by MRI or angiography at a median follow-up time of 39.3 months (range 10-174 months). There were 828.7 patient-years of follow-up within the latency interval between SRS and the date of confirmed AVM obliteration. Among nonpregnant women, 20 hemorrhages occurred before AVM obliteration, yielding an annual hemorrhage rate of 2.5% for nonpregnant women during the latency interval. Among women who became pregnant during the latency interval, 2 hemorrhages occurred over the course of 18 pregnancies, yielding an annual hemorrhage rate of 11.1% for women who become pregnant during the latency interval. For the 2 pregnant patients who experienced hemorrhage, the bleeding occurred during the first trimester of pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: The authors present the first series of data for women with intracranial AVMs who became pregnant during the latency interval after SRS. Hemorrhage during the latency interval occurred at an annual rate of 2.5% for nonpregnant women and 11.1% for pregnant women. The data suggest that pregnancy might be a risk factor for AVM hemorrhage during the interval between SRS and AVM obliteration. However, this suggestion is not statistically significant because only 18 patients in the study population became pregnant during the latency interval. To mitigate any increased risk for hemorrhage, patients should consider deferring pregnancy until treatment conclusion and AVM obliteration.",2014 Dec,2014,Journal of neurosurgery,121 Suppl,,226-31,eng,False,10.3171/2014.7.GKS141297;10.3171/2014.7.GKS141297,"Case Reports;Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adolescent;Adult;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/pathology/*surgery;Intracranial Hemorrhages/*etiology/pathology;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Pregnancy;Pregnancy Complications, Cardiovascular/*etiology/pathology;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",AVM = arteriovenous malformation;GK = Gamma Knife;Gamma Knife;SRS = stereotactic radiosurgery;arteriovenous malformation;pregnancy;stereotactic radiosurgery;vascular disorders

Herein, we report such a case with an additional unruptured aneurysm on the feeding artery and highlight the role of a multimodality approach to their management. A 50-year-old female presented with drug-resistant right-sided trigeminal neuralgia for one year. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggested a possibility of AVM, the angiographic study showed an AVM nidus with feeders from the right anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) and a dilated right intrinsic pontine artery, the latter showing a flow-related aneurysm towards its brainstem end. The flow-related aneurysm, as well as the dilated intrinsic pontine artery feeder, was embolized at first. During surgery, the AVM was found embedded inside the root entry zone. Parts of the AVM and its draining vein were partially coagulated followed by microvascular decompression of the AICA loop as well as a feeder emanating from it following which the patient recovered completely. She subsequently received gamma knife surgery (GKS) for the residual AVM and remained asymptomatic after 3.5 years of GKS. AVM-related TN are rare, and the additional presence of a feeding artery aneurysm increases the management complexity. Endovascular management of the aneurysm followed by microvascular decompression (MVD) and tailored AVM coagulation represent a prompt and effective means of pain control. Subsequent GKS is necessary to obliterate the AVM nidus.",2021 May-Jun,2021,Neurology India,69,3,744-747,eng,False,10.4103/0028-3886.319235;ni_2021_69_3_744_319235;10.4103/0028-3886.319235,Case Reports;Journal Article,*Aneurysm;Female;Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/diagnostic;*Microvascular Decompression Surgery;Middle Aged;*Radiosurgery;*Trigeminal Neuralgia/etiology/surgery,Aneurysm;arteriovenous malformation;multimodality approach;root entry zone;trigeminal neuralgia
31932976,Surgical strategies for management of pediatric arteriovenous malformation rupture: the role of initial decompressive craniectomy.,"INTRODUCTION: Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are a common cause of intracranial hemorrhage in children, which can result in elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral edema. We sought to explore the role of initial decompressive craniectomy at time of rupture, followed by interval surgical AVM resection, compared to treatment with initial resection, in clinical outcomes and recovery in children. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted examining patients age 0-18 with AVM rupture between 2005 and 2018 who underwent resection for ruptured AVM either initially at presentation or underwent initial decompressive craniectomy followed by interval AVM resection. Clinical, radiographic, surgical, and outcome data were examined. Primary outcomes measured included functional status, AVM obliteration rate, AVM recurrence/residual, and re-hemorrhage. RESULTS: Thirty-six cases were included; 28 (77.8%) underwent initial AVM resection, and 7 (19.4%) underwent initial decompressive craniectomy with interval resection. The mean time between craniectomy and resection was 66.9 days (SD 59.3). Patients undergoing initial decompressive craniectomy with interval resection were younger (mean age 6.1 vs. 9.8 years, p = 0.05) and had a higher mean hematoma volume (52.9 vs. 22.2 mL, p = 0.01), mean midline shift (5.1 vs. 2.1 mm, p = 0.01), and presence of cisternal effacement (p = 0.01). There were no statistically significant associations between surgical strategy and postoperative outcomes, including complications, radiographic outcomes, complete resection, residual, recurrence, and functional outcomes. Those treated by initial craniectomy followed by interval resection were associated with undergoing additional procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Children presenting with AVM rupture who require emergent decompression may safely undergo emergent craniectomy with interval AVM resection and cranioplasty without additional risk of morbidity or mortality. This is reasonable in those with elevated intracranial pressure. This strategy may provide time for initial recovery and allow for natural degradation of the hematoma enhancing the plane for interval AVM resection, perhaps improving outcomes.",2020 Jul,2020,Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for,36,7,1445-1452,eng,False,10.1007/s00381-020-04501-0;10.1007/s00381-020-04501-0;10.1007/s00381-020-04501-0,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Child;Child, Preschool;*Decompressive Craniectomy;Humans;Infant;Infant, Newborn;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/diagnostic;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome",Arteriovenous malformation resection;Arteriovenous malformation rupture;Decompressive craniectomy;Pediatric arteriovenous malformation
27544231,Risk of hemorrhage in patients over age 60 with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs).,"Treatment selection for patients 60years of age and older with intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), requires careful consideration of the natural history and post-treatment hemorrhagic risk. We aimed to directly compare the natural history of AVMs with post-treatment hemorrhagic risk in this population. We retrospectively reviewed our AVM database of 683 patients. Patients ⩾60years at diagnosis were included. Treatment modality was divided into four groups: surgery±embolization (SE), radiosurgery±embolization (RE), embolization only (Emb), and observation (Obs). The natural history of the AVM was defined as the annual risk of hemorrhage under observation. Risk of hemorrhage after treatment was also calculated. Sixty-one patients with complete data were included. Average age was 68.4±7.5years, with 55.7% (n=34) being male. Twenty-seven (44.3%) patients presented with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). At last follow-up, modified Rankin Scale was higher in patients with subsequent hemorrhages (p=0.023). Overall, obliteration was 65.5%, with 100.0% in the SE group and 43.8% in the RE group (p<0.001). During an average follow-up period of 2.8±3.2years, six patients (9.8%) experienced hemorrhage, with two (12.5%) in the RE group, three (9.4%) in the Obs group and one (9.1%) in the SE group, corresponding to a natural history of 3.5% annual hemorrhage rate and a post-treatment hemorrhagic risk of 3.6%. This post-treatment hemorrhage risk was 2.4% in the SE group and 4.9% in the RE group. Presenting with ICH (p=0.042) and race (p=0.014) were associated with a higher risk of follow-up hemorrhage. Definitive treatment for AVM patients ⩾60years should be cautiously considered. Despite higher post-treatment obliteration rates, the subsequent hemorrhagic risk may exceed that of its natural history. For AVMs with a high risk for hemorrhage, surgery reduces hemorrhagic risk and achieves the highest rate of obliteration.",2016 Dec,2016,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society,34,,121-127,eng,False,S0967-5868(16)30255-7;10.1016/j.jocn.2016.05.010;S0967-5868(16)30255-7;10.1016/j.jocn.2016.05.010,Journal Article,"Aged;Databases, Factual;Embolization, Therapeutic/adverse effects;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*complications/drug therapy/*surgery;Intracranial Hemorrhages/*complications;Male;Middle Aged;Patient Selection;Radiosurgery/adverse effects;Retrospective Studies;Risk Factors;Treatment Outcome",Arteriovenous Malformation;Elderly Patients;Hemorrhagic Presentation;Natural History
15662777,Long-term complications after gamma knife surgery for arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECT: The authors analyzed of the long-term complications that occur 2 or more years after gamma knife surgery (GKS) for intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). METHODS: Patients with previously untreated intracranial AVMs that were managed by GKS and followed for at least 2 years after treatment were selected for analysis (237 cases). Complete AVM obliteration was attained in 130 cases (54.9%), and incomplete obliteration in 107 cases (45.1%). Long-term complications were observed in 22 patients (9.3%). These complications included hemorrhage (eight cases), delayed cyst formation (eight cases), increase of seizure frequency (four cases), and middle cerebral artery stenosis and increased white matter signal intensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (one case of each). The long-term complications were associated with larger nidus volume (p < 0.001) and a lobar location of the AVM (p < 0.01). Delayed hemorrhage was associated only with incomplete obliteration of the nidus (p < 0.05). Partial obliteration conveyed no benefit. Delayed cyst formation was associated with a higher maximal GKS dose (p < 0.001), larger nidus volume (p < 0.001), complete nidus obliteration (p < 0.01), and a lobar location of the AVM (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Incomplete obliteration of the nidus is the most important factor associated with delayed hemorrhagic complications. Partial obliteration does not seem to reduce the risk of hemorrhage. Complete obliteration can be complicated by delayed cyst formation, especially if high maximal treatment doses have been administered.",2005 Jan,2005,Journal of neurosurgery,102 Suppl,,34-7,eng,True,10.3171/jns.2005.102.s_supplement.0034,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Brain/blood supply/diagnostic imaging/pathology/surgery;Cerebral Angiography;Cerebral Hemorrhage/*etiology;Child;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/pathology/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;*Postoperative Complications;Radiation Dosage;Radiosurgery/*instrumentation;Time;Tomography, X-Ray Computed",
27058198,Seizure outcomes after stereotactic radiosurgery for the treatment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVE Patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) commonly present with seizure. Seizure outcomes in patients treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) are poorly defined. A case series of patients with cerebral AVMs treated with SRS is presented to evaluate long-term seizure outcome. METHODS A retrospective review of the medical record was performed, identifying 204 consecutive patients with AVMs treated with SRS between January 1991 and June 2012. Clinical and radiographic data were evaluated. Seizure outcome was measured using the Engel Epilepsy Surgery Outcome Scale. Mean duration of follow-up was 37.1 months (SD 38.3 months) with a minimum follow-up period of 1 month. RESULTS Of the 204 patients with cerebral AVMs treated with SRS, 78 patients (38.2%) presented with seizures and 49 of those patients were treated with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Following SRS, 63 (80.8%) of the 78 patients who had had seizures prior to SRS were seizure-free at a mean follow-up time of 37.2 months (SD 41.3 months). Of the 49 patients who had been treated with AEDs, 17 were still taking AEDs at last follow-up. Of the 126 patients who did not present with seizures prior to treatment with SRS, only 5 patients (4.0%) had seizures in the post-SRS period. There was no significant correlation between post-SRS seizure status and patient demographic features, comorbidities, AVM characteristics, history of operative intervention, pre- or posttreatment hemorrhage, or radiographic degree of AVM resolution. CONCLUSIONS Stereotactic radiosurgery for treatment of cerebral AVMs is effective at providing long-term control of seizures. A substantial number of patients who were treated with SRS were not only seizure free at their last follow-up, but had been successfully weaned from antiepileptic medications.",2017 Mar,2017,Journal of neurosurgery,126,3,845-851,eng,True,10.3171/2015.12.JNS152461;10.3171/2015.12.JNS152461,Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use;Child;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*complications/diagnostic;Male;Middle Aged;Prospective Studies;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects;Retrospective Studies;Seizures/diagnostic imaging/*etiology/*therapy;Severity of Illness Index;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult,AED = antiepileptic drug;AVM;AVM = arteriovenous malformation;CTA = CT angiography;DSA = digital subtraction angiography;ICH = intracerebral hemorrhage;SRS = stereotactic radiosurgery;arteriovenous malformation;seizure;stereotactic radiosurgery;vascular disorders
22186841,Stereotactic radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations located in deep critical regions.,"BACKGROUND: Radiosurgery is widely used to treat deep eloquent arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate how anatomic location, AVM size, and treatment parameters define outcome. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 356 thalamic/basal ganglia and 160 brainstem AVMs treated with gamma knife radiosurgery. RESULTS: Median volume was 2 cm (range, 0.02-50) for supratentorial and 0.5 cm (range, 0.01-40) for brainstem AVMs; the marginal treatment doses were 17.5 to 25 Gy. After single treatment, obliteration was achieved in 65% of the brainstem, in 69% of the supratentorial, and 40% of the peritectal AVMs. Obliteration of lesions <4 cm was better in the brainstem (70%) and in the supratentorium (80%), but not in the peritectal region (40%). Complications were rare (6%-15%) and mild (≤ modified Rankin scale [MRS] 2). Rebleed rate increased with size, but was not higher than before treatment. AVMs >4 cm in the brainstem were treated with unacceptable morbidity and low cure rate. Obliteration of large supratentorial AVMs was 65% to 47% with more complications ≥ MRS3. Repeat radiosurgical treatment led to obliteration in 66% of the cases with minor morbidity. CONCLUSION: Deep eloquent AVMs <4 cm can be treated safely and effectively with radiosurgery. Obliteration of peritectal AVMs is significantly lower after a single treatment. However, morbidity is low, and repeat treatment leads to good obliteration. Radiosurgical treatment >4 cm in the brainstem is not recommended. Supratentorial deep AVMs >8 cm can be treated with radiosurgery with higher risk and lower obliteration rate. However, these lesions are difficult to treat with other treatment modalities, and a 50% success rate makes radiosurgery a good alternative even in this challenging group.",2012 Jun,2012,Neurosurgery,70,6,1458-69; discussion 1469-71,eng,True,10.1227/NEU.0b013e318246a4d0;10.1227/NEU.0b013e318246a4d0,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Arteriovenous Fistula/pathology/*surgery;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Humans;Infant;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*pathology/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Postoperative Complications/epidemiology;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",
31043153,Risk of Brain Arteriovenous Malformation Hemorrhage Before and After Stereotactic Radiosurgery.,"Background and Purpose- Understanding the hemorrhage risks associated with brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) before and after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is important. The aims of this multicenter, retrospective cohort study are to evaluate and compare the rates of pre- and post-SRS AVM hemorrhage and identify risk factors. Methods- We pooled AVM SRS data from 8 institutions participating in the International Radiosurgery Research Foundation. Predictors of post-SRS hemorrhage were determined using a multivariate logistic regression model. Pre- and post-SRS hemorrhage rates were compared using Fisher exact test. Ruptured and unruptured AVMs were matched in a 1:1 ratio using propensity scores, and their outcomes were compared. Results- The study cohort comprised 2320 AVM patients who underwent SRS. Deep AVM location (odds ratio, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.19-2.92; P=0.007), the presence of an AVM-associated arterial aneurysm (odds ratio, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.63-3.66; P<0.001), and lower SRS margin dose (odds ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.88-0.98; P=0.005) were independent predictors of post-SRS hemorrhage. The post-SRS hemorrhage rate was lower for obliterated versus patent AVMs (6.0 versus 22.3 hemorrhages/1000 person-years; P<0.001). The AVM hemorrhage rate decreased from 15.4 hemorrhages/1000 person-years before SRS to 11.9 after SRS ( P=0.001). The outcomes of the matched ruptured versus unruptured AVM cohorts were similar. Conclusions- SRS appears to reduce the risk of AVM hemorrhage, although this effect is predominantly driven by obliteration. Deep-seated AVMs are more likely to rupture during the latency period after SRS. AVM-associated aneurysms should be considered for selective occlusion before SRS of the nidus to ameliorate the post-SRS hemorrhage rate of these lesions.",2019 Jun,2019,Stroke,50,6,1384-1391,eng,False,10.1161/STROKEAHA.118.024230;10.1161/STROKEAHA.118.024230,Journal Article;Multicenter Study,Adolescent;Adult;Cerebral Hemorrhage/*epidemiology/*etiology;Child;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*epidemiology/*radiotherapy;Male;Middle Aged;Predictive Value of Tests;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects;Retrospective Studies;Risk Factors,cerebral arteries;intracranial hemorrhages;radiosurgery;risk factors;vascular malformations
24878292,Gamma Knife surgery for arteriovenous malformations within or adjacent to the ventricles.,"OBJECT: The outcomes of stereotactic radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) within or adjacent to the ventricular system are largely unknown. This study assessed the long-term outcomes and hemorrhage risks for patients with AVMs within this region who underwent Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) at the University of Pittsburgh. METHODS: The authors retrospectively identified 188 patients with ventricular-region AVMs who underwent a single-stage GKS procedure during a 22-year interval. The median patient age was 32 years (range 3-80 years), the median target volume was 4.6 cm(3) (range 0.1-22 cm(3)), and the median marginal dose was 20 Gy (range 13-27 Gy). RESULTS: Arteriovenous malformation obliteration was confirmed by MRI or angiography in 89 patients during a median follow-up of 65 months (range 2-265 months). The actuarial rates of total obliteration were 32% at 3 years, 55% at 4 years, 60% at 5 years, and 64% at 10 years. Higher rates of AVM obliteration were obtained in the 26 patients with intraventricular AVMs. Twenty-five patients (13%) sustained a hemorrhage during the initial latency interval after GKS, indicating an annual hemorrhage rate of 3.4% prior to AVM obliteration. No patient experienced a hemorrhage after AVM obliteration was confirmed by imaging. Permanent neurological deficits due to adverse radiation effects developed in 7 patients (4%). CONCLUSIONS: Although patients in this study demonstrated an elevated hemorrhage risk that remained until complete obliteration, GKS still proved to be a generally safe and effective treatment for patients with these high-risk intraventricular and periventriclar AVMs.",2014 Dec,2014,Journal of neurosurgery,121,6,1416-23,eng,False,10.3171/2014.4.JNS131943;10.3171/2014.4.JNS131943,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology;Cerebral Ventricles/*surgery;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/*surgery;Kaplan-Meier Estimate;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/*methods;Reoperation;Retrospective Studies;Risk Assessment;Stroke/etiology;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",AVM = arteriovenous malformation;GKS = Gamma Knife surgery;arteriovenous malformation;hemorrhage;stereotactic radiosurgery;vascular disorders;ventricle
19440671,Influence of intravenous contrast agent on dose calculation in 3-D treatment planning for radiosurgery of cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"PURPOSE: To investigate the influence of local density increase by i.v. contrast agent on dose calculation in linac-based radiosurgery (RS) of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). MATERIAL AND METHODS: RS was performed after three-dimensional (3-D) treatment planning using a total number of nine to 14 beams. Mean target volume was 5.3 cm(3) (range, 0.1-41.2 cm(3)). Mean maximum diameter was 23.2 mm (range, 8-51 mm). Dose deviation was estimated and calculated from the enhanced and unenhanced datasets of 30 patients. Dose calculation was performed using the same RS treatment plan on both datasets. Both plans were standardized to 1 Gy at isocenter with the same dose weight for all beams. RESULTS: Mean difference of Hounsfield units (DeltaHU) between enhanced and unenhanced CT was 152 HU (range, 50-350 HU). The estimated dose deviation was <or= 1% in 80% of cases with a mean deviation of 0.67% and a maximum dose deviation of 1.8%. With increasing DeltaHU and increasing maximum diameter dose deviation increased as well. The calculated overdosage in ten datasets of enhanced and unenhanced CT scans was 0.66% mean (range, 0.2-1.2%). CONCLUSION: The use of i.v. contrast agent in 3-D treatment planning for RS of cerebral AVMs may lead to an underestimation of actual applied dose. The effect on dose calculation is rather low with dose deviations < +1% in most of the cases. However, there are cases especially in large AVMs with high DeltaHU located next to critical, radiosensitive structures in which an additional unenhanced CT scan is recommended for exact dose calculation to avoid side effects.",2009 May,2009,Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ...

31757032,Radiation-Stimulated Translocation of CD166 and CRYAB to the Endothelial Surface Provides Potential Vascular Targets on Irradiated Brain Arteriovenous Malformations.,"Vascular targeting with pro-thrombotic antibody-conjugates is a promising biological treatment for brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs). However, targeted drug delivery relies on the identification of unique or overexpressed markers on the surface of a target cell. In the absence of inherent biological markers, stereotactic radiosurgery may be used to prime induction of site-specific and targetable molecular changes on the endothelial surface. To investigate lumen-accessible, endothelial targets induced by radiation, we combined Gamma knife surgery in an AVM animal model with in vivo biotin-labeling and comparative proteomics. Two proteins, αB-crystallin (CRYAB)-a small heat shock protein that normally acts as an intracellular chaperone to misfolded proteins-and activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule CD166, were further validated for endothelial surface expression after irradiation. Immunostaining of endothelial cells in vitro and rat AVM tissue ex vivo confirmed de novo induction of CRYAB following irradiation (20 Gy). Western analysis demonstrated that CRYAB accumulated intracellularly as a 20 kDa monomer, but, at the cell surface, a novel 65 kDa protein was observed, suggesting radiation stimulates translocation of an atypical CRYAB isoform. In contrast, CD166 had relatively high expression in non-irradiated cells, localized predominantly to the lateral surfaces. Radiation increased CD166 surface exposure by inducing translocation from intercellular junctions to the apical surface without significantly altering total protein levels. These findings reinforce the dynamic molecular changes induced by radiation exposure, particularly at the cell surface, and support further investigation of radiation as a priming mechanism and these molecules as putative targets for focused drug delivery in irradiated tissue.",2019 Nov 20,2019,International journal of molecular sciences,20,23,,eng,False,10.3390/ijms20235830;5830;ijms20235830;ijms-20-05830;10.3390/ijms20235830,Journal Article,"Animals;Cell Membrane/metabolism;Cells, Cultured;Crystallins/*metabolism;Endothelial Cells/metabolism/*radiation effects;Gamma Rays/adverse effects;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/metabolism/*radiotherapy;Mice;Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*metabolism;Protein Transport;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism",brain arteriovenous malformation;endothelial cells;ionizing radiation;proteomics;stereotactic radiosurgery;vascular targeting
21181407,Changes in AVM angio-architecture and hemodynamics after stereotactic radiosurgery assessed by dynamic MRA and phase contrast flow assessments: a prospective follow-up study.,"OBJECTIVES: Assessment of changes in the hemodynamics of Arteriovenous malformations (AVM) induced by radiosurgery by MR Phase contrast (PC) measurements of the internal carotid arteries (ICA). METHODS: 65 patients shortly after or before stereotactic radiosurgery underwent MRI including morphological series, MR-Angiography (Time-of-flight, dynamic MRA) and bilateral ECG triggered MR phase contrast (PC) measurements of the ICA. Follow-up was performed in 34 patients. The observation period was up to 4 years. RESULTS: Over all subjects, a significant relationship between mean arterial blood flow in the ICA on the side of the lesion and AVM volume was revealed (p = 0,0002). In large (>10 ccm) and medium-sized AVMs, (>3, 5 ≤ 10 ccm) the blood flow was significantly increased on the side of the AVM (p = 0,0004; p = 0,047), whereas in lesions <3, 5 ccm, no significant rise of the mean blood flow was detectable. At follow-up, the mean blood flow in the ipsilateral artery was not increased anymore compared to the contralateral ICA (p = 0,11). These changes correlated with a significant reduction of the average AVM volume (p = 0, 0026). CONCLUSIONS: The AVM angioarchitecture has significant impact on the blood flow in feeding arteries.

14630278,Clinical significance of 3D reconstruction of arteriovenous malformation using digital subtraction angiography and its modification with CT information in stereotactic radiosurgery.,"PURPOSE: A three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction method of arteriovenous malformation (AVM) nidus from digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in combination with CT and/or MRI was developed, and its usefulness was evaluated in this study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The contour of the AVM nidus was delineated on two orthogonal projected DSA images. First, the volume and center of the AVM nidus were calculated in a classic DSA plan using three maximal lengths of the nidus in three perpendicular directions, assuming that the nidus had a prolate ellipsoid shape. Second, in the 3D-DSA plan, the contours of the AVM nidus on the two orthogonal projected DSA images were segmented to be compatible with the slice thickness of the CT image. Assuming that each segment of the nidus has an ellipsoid pillar shape, the volume and center of each segment were calculated. The volume and 3D shape of the nidus were calculated by 3D reconstruction in the 3D-DSA plan. Third, in the CT-DSA plan, the contour based on the segmented DSA was superimposed on the corresponding transaxial CT image slice by slice. The cylindrical shape of the nidus in the transaxial image was modified using the enhanced CT images in the CT-DSA plan. These three planning methods were compared using dose-volume statistics from real patients' data. Eighteen patients with intracranial AVMs in different brain locations who had been treated by radiosurgery were the subjects of this study. To examine the visibility (validity) of the nidus on the CT image, the ""nidus"" was delineated on an enhanced CT image without DSA superposition in the CT plan and compared with the CT-DSA plan. RESULTS: The variance in the distance between coordinates determined by the CT plan and those determined by the classic DSA plan was significantly larger than the variance in the CT-DSA plan (p < 0.0001 for lateral, AP, and craniocaudal directions). The difference in the variance was not reduced by the addition of MRI (p < 0.0001 for each direction). The mean volume +/- SD of the nidus calculated was 5.9 +/- 8.0 cm(3) in the classic DSA plan, 4.0 +/- 5.6 cm(3) in the 3D-DSA plan, and 3.6 +/- 5.2 cm(3) in the CT-DSA plan. The 3D-DSA plan significantly reduced the mean nidus volume 31.8% +/- 12.7% from the classic DSA plan (p = 0.0054). The CT-DSA plan further significantly reduced the volume 9.8% +/- 8.8% from the 3D-DSA plan (p = 0.0021). The mean overlapping volume of the nidus between the CT plan and CT-DSA plan was 2.6 +/- 4.3 cm(3) (range 0.17-18.9), corresponding to 63.7% +/- 19.2% (range 11.4-85.3%) of the volume in the CT-DSA plan. CONCLUSIONS: The superposition of the segmented DSA information on CT was shown to be an important tool to determine the precise shape of the nidus and is suggested to be useful to reduce partial occlusion of the AVM or radiation complications in radiosurgery.",2003 Dec 1,2003,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",57,5,1392-9,eng,False,S0360301603007806;10.1016/s0360-3016(03)00780-6,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adolescent;Adult;Aged;*Angiography, Digital Subtraction;Child;Female;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional/*methods;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/surgery;Magnetic Resonance Angiography;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery;*Tomography, X-Ray Computed",

We report the largest series of patients with histologically confirmed intracranial extravascular PEH developing in the field of previous treatment with stereotactic radiosurgery. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: We collected the clinical, radiological, surgical, and pathological findings from 4 patients in whom intracranial extravascular PEH developed after treatment with stereotactic radiosurgery. In all patients, the development of an enlarging hemorrhagic mass lesion at the site of previous radiotherapy on magnetic resonance imaging was radiographically suspicious for neoplasm and prompted biopsy or resection. All 4 patients elected to undergo biopsy or surgical resection. Histological examination of the biopsy and resection specimens in all patients demonstrated the classic features of PEH. CONCLUSION: The interval to the development of PEH ranged from 5 months to 6 years, 10 months. Clinical follow-up was available for 3 of the 4 patients. None of these 3 patients have demonstrated evidence of recurrence during a mean follow-up period of 22 months (range, 15-30 months). These patients share common radiological features, potentially allowing preoperative diagnosis and improved guidance of clinical management. These cases suggest a link between radiosurgery and the development of PEH. These findings also suggest that PEH should be considered in the differential diagnosis for patients treated with radiosurgery in whom a hemorrhagic mass lesion subsequently develops at or near the site of previous treatment.

30658138,Arterial-spin labeling MRI identifies residual cerebral arteriovenous malformation following stereotactic radiosurgery treatment.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM) treatment by stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is effective, but AVM obliteration following SRS may take two years or longer. MRI with arterial-spin labeling (ASL) may detect brain AVMs with high sensitivity. We determined whether brain MRI with ASL may accurately detect residual AVM following SRS treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent brain AVM evaluation by DSA between June 2010 and June 2015. Inclusion criteria were: (1) AVM treatment by SRS, (2) follow-up MRI with ASL at least 30 months after SRS, (3) DSA within 3 months of the follow-up MRI with ASL, and (4) no intervening AVM treatment between the MRI and DSA. Four neuroradiologists blindly and independently reviewed follow-up MRIs. Primary outcome measure was residual AVM indicated by abnormal venous ASL signal. RESULTS: 15 patients (12 females, mean age 29 years) met inclusion criteria. There were three posterior fossa AVMs and 12 supratentorial AVMs. Spetzler-Martin (SM) Grades were: SM1 (8%), SM2 (33%), SM3 (17%), SM4 (25%), and SM5 (17%). DSA demonstrated residual AVM in 10 patients. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of venous ASL signal for predicting residual AVM were 100% (95% CI: 0.9-1.0), 95% (95% CI: 0.7-1.0), 98% (95% CI: 0.9-1.0), and 100% (95% CI: 0.8-1.0), respectively.

16466235,Grading and surgical planning for intracranial arteriovenous malformations.,"The treatment of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) has evolved over the last 40 years. These complex vascular lesions remain among the most difficult lesions to treat. Successful treatment of AVMs of the brain includes extensive preoperative planning, multimodality treatment options, and modern postoperative surgical care. The advent of new technologies, including interventional neuroradiology and radiosurgery, has expanded the range of malformations that can be treated effectively and has had a significant impact on those individuals who manifest this disease process. The purpose of this paper is to describe the current grading technique used by the authors and to explore the preoperative treatment and planning that leads to successful surgical obliteration of these lesions. Some description of preoperative interventions, including radiosurgery and interventional procedures will be mentioned; however, only in the context of how they impact on the surgical treatment of these lesions. In other articles in this edition of Neurosurgical Focus interventional procedures and radiosurgery as treatment adjuncts and as primary therapies will be discussed in greater detail.",2001 Nov 15,2001,Neurosurgical focus,11,5,e3,eng,False,110503;10.3171/foc.2001.11.5.4,Journal Article;Review,"Angiography, Digital Subtraction;Cerebral Angiography;Combined Modality Therapy;Embolization, Therapeutic;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/*surgery/therapy;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Microsurgery;Postoperative Care;Preoperative Care;Radiosurgery;Severity of Illness Index;Tomography, X-Ray Computed",

We examined the role of multimodality AVM treatment in pediatric AVM-associated epilepsy to characterize long-term epilepsy outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective chart review identified pediatric patients with AVM-associated epilepsy seen at our institution from 2005 to 2018. Variables measured included demographic and descriptive data. Primary outcomes included seizure freedom, seizure control, and functional outcomes. RESULTS: Of 105 pediatric patients with AVMs, 18 had AVM-related epilepsy. Thirteen underwent surgical resection, of which 6 underwent preoperative embolization. Twelve (92.31%) had complete resection; one (7.69%) with residual underwent redo craniotomy with subsequent complete resection. All had radiographic cure at most recent follow-up, with no recurrence seen during length of follow-up (mean 2.17 years, SD 1.40, range 0.25-4.41). Eight (61.54%) experienced seizure freedom postoperatively; 12 (92.31%) were modified Engel Class I at last follow-up. Five patients underwent treatment without open surgical resection, with conservative management (3, 60%) or endovascular embolization (2, 40%). None in our cohort underwent radiosurgery. Of those embolized, one had complete AVM obliteration and two had partial obliteration. Four of the 5 patients (80%) treated without open surgery achieved seizure freedom. CONCLUSION: Long-term outcomes of AVM-related epilepsy are poorly characterized in children. We found that in addition to improved AVM outcomes regarding obliteration, treatment of residual, and recurrence, pediatric patients undergoing surgical AVM treatment had improved AVM-associated epilepsy outcomes, with 61.54% achieving seizure freedom and 92.31% classified as modified Engel Class I seizure control.",2021 Jul,2021,Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for,37,7,2261-2268,eng,False,10.1007/s00381-021-05170-3;10.1007/s00381-021-05170-3;10.1007/s00381-021-05170-3,Journal Article,Child;*Epilepsy/epidemiology/etiology/therapy;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/surgery;*Pediatrics;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome,Arteriovenous malformation;Epilepsy;Pediatric epilepsy;Pediatric vascular malformations
27662534,Early versus late arteriovenous malformation responders after stereotactic radiosurgery: an international multicenter study.,"OBJECTIVE The goal of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is complete nidus obliteration, thereby eliminating the risk of future hemorrhage. This outcome can be observed within the first 18 months, although documentation of AVM obliteration can extend to as much as 5 years after SRS is performed. A shorter time to obliteration may impact the frequency and effect of post-SRS complications and latency hemorrhage. The authors' goal in the present study was to determine predictors of early obliteration (18 months or less) following SRS for cerebral AVM. METHODS Eight centers participating in the International Gamma Knife Research Foundation (IGKRF) obtained institutional review board approval to supply de-identified patient data. From a cohort of 2231 patients, a total of 1398 patients had confirmed AVM obliteration. Patients were sorted into early responders (198 patients), defined as those with confirmed nidus obliteration at or prior to 18 months after SRS, and late responders (1200 patients), defined as those with confirmed nidus obliteration more than 18 months after SRS. The median clinical follow-up time was 63.7 months (range 7-324.7 months). RESULTS Outcome parameters including latency interval hemorrhage, mortality, and favorable outcome were not significantly different between the 2 groups. Radiologically demonstrated radiation-induced changes were noted more often in the late responder group (376 patients [31.3%] vs 39 patients [19.7%] for early responders, p = 0.005). Multivariate independent predictors of early obliteration included a margin dose > 24 Gy (p = 0.031), prior surgery (p = 0.002), no prior radiotherapy (p = 0.025), smaller AVM nidus (p = 0.002), deep venous drainage (p = 0.039), and nidus location (p < 0.0001). Basal ganglia, cerebellum, and frontal lobe nidus locations favored early obliteration (p = 0.009). The Virginia Radiosurgery AVM Scale (VRAS) score was significantly different between the 2 responder groups (p = 0.039). The VRAS score was also shown to be predictive of early obliteration on univariate analysis (p = 0.009). For early obliteration, such prognostic ability was not shown for other SRS- and AVM-related grading systems. CONCLUSIONS Early obliteration (≤ 18 months post-SRS) was more common in patients whose AVMs were smaller, located in the frontal lobe, basal ganglia, or cerebellum, had deep venous drainage, and had received a margin dose > 24 Gy.",2017 Sep,2017,Journal of neurosurgery,127,3,503-511,eng,False,10.3171/2016.7.JNS161194;10.3171/2016.7.JNS161194,Comparative Study;Journal Article;Multicenter Study,Adult;Arteriovenous Fistula/complications/*radiotherapy;Female;Humans;Internationality;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/*radiotherapy;Male;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Time Factors;Treatment Outcome,AVM = arteriovenous malformation;GKRS = Gamma Knife radiosurgery;Gamma Knife;IGKRF = International Gamma Knife Research Foundation;MRA = MR angiography;RBAS = Radiosurgery-Based AVM score;RIC = radiation-induced change;SM = Spetzler-Martin;SRS = stereotactic radiosurgery;VRAS = Virginia Radiosurgery AVM Scale;arteriovenous malformation;early obliteration;embolization;radiosurgery;stereotactic radiosurgery;vascular disorders
15726439,Linac radiosurgery as a tool in neurosurgery.,"Stereotactic radiosurgery is a radiation technique that uses a high radiation dose focused on a stereotactic defined intracranial target in single fraction with high precision. In the 1980s, linear accelerators were introduced as a tool for radiosurgery beneath the already accepted gamma unit. Technique and mechanical precision of LINACs have become equal to the gamma unit and LINAC radiosurgery became more and more used recently. From January 1996 to August 2003 we have treated 237 patients with LINAC radiosurgery. A combination of the University of Florida system and the X Knife System, developed by Radionics, was used in all patients. A number of 110 patients had 161 brain metastases treated, whereas the local tumor control rate was 89.4%. The 1-year survival rate was 54.9% with a median survival of 54 weeks. In 55 patients we have treated 57 meningiomas, mostly located at the skull base (37 out of 55 patients). Local tumor control rate in our patients with skull base meningiomas at 5-year follow up was 97.2%. In this time period, we have also treated acoustic schwannoma, glioma, pituitary adenoma, arteriovenous malformations and patients with trigeminal neuralgia. LINAC radiosurgery has become a daily tool in neurosurgery and changed treatment strategies especially in the treatment of brain metastases and skull base meningiomas towards a less aggressive and multimodality approach. It is not only an alternative to open surgery, but also a very effective adjuvant treatment modality in many neuro-oncological patients, which helps us to enhance tumor control rate, minimize morbidity and increase postoperative quality of life.",2005 Apr,2005,Neurosurgical review,28,2,"79-88; discussion 89-90, 91",eng,False,10.1007/s10143-005-0376-7,Journal Article;Review,"Brain Neoplasms/mortality/secondary/*surgery;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery;Radiosurgery/*methods;Radiotherapy, Computer-Assisted/methods;Treatment Outcome",

OBJECTIVE: To describe our experience treating pediatric AVMs. METHODS: We analyzed 120 pediatric patients (< 18 years of age) with AVMs treated with various combinations of radiosurgery, surgery, and endovascular techniques. RESULTS: Between 1985 and 2009, 76 children with low Spetzler-Martin grade (1-3) and 44 with high-grade (4-5) AVMs were treated. Annual risk of hemorrhage from presentation to initial treatment was 4.0%, decreasing to 3.2% after treatment initiation until confirmed obliteration. Results for AVM obliteration were available in 101 patients. Initial single-modality therapy led to AVM obliteration in 51 of 67 low-grade (76%) and 3 of 34 high-grade (9%) AVMs, improving to 58 of 67 (87%) and 9 of 34 (26%), respectively, with further treatment. Mean time to obliteration was 1.8 years for low-grade and 6.4 years for high-grade AVMs. Disabling neurological complications occurred in 4 of 77 low-grade (5%) and 12 of 43 high-grade (28%) AVMs. At the final clinical follow-up (mean, 9.2 years), 48 of 67 patients (72%) with low-grade lesions had a modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) of 0 to 1 compared with 12 of 34 patients (35%) with high-grade AVMs. On multivariate analysis, significant risk factors for poor final clinical outcome (mRS ≥ 2) included baseline mRS ≥ 2 (odds ratio, 9.51; 95% confidence interval, 3.31-27.37; P < .01), left-sided location (odds ratio, 3.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-8.33; P = .03), and high AVM grade (odds ratio, 4.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.28-14.28; P = .02). CONCLUSION: Treatment of pediatric AVMs with multimodality therapy can substantially improve obliteration rates and may decrease AVM hemorrhage rates.

Fifty-seven patients had supplemental stereotactic irradiation, and 13 had subsequent surgery. The follow-up was carried out clinically and radiologically. RESULTS: The mean follow-up time was 6.2 years. Only four patients were lost to follow-up. If at least 90% of the AVM had been obliterated, the clinical course was stable and there were no new manifestations from the AVM. No recanalization occurred in any AVM that had been totally obliterated with glue. For patients in whom it was not possible to totally obliterate the AVM either with glue alone or glue supplemented with stereotactic irradiation or surgery, the long-term outcome was discouraging.

33896340,Risk factors of seizure presentation in brain arteriovenous malformation patients and seizure outcomes after single-modality treatments.,"BACKGROUND: Epileptic seizures are common symptoms in brain arteriovenous malformation patients and seizure control was an important issue in the treatments. This retrospective study attempted to define the risk factors of seizure presentation and to evaluate the effects of treatment modalities on seizure outcomes. METHODS: Patients receiving single treatment modality during 2013-2016 years, followed up more than 2 years were recruited. Logistic regression analysis was used to detect independent predictors. The factors associated with seizure control were analyzed in patients with pre-treatment seizures, and the factors associated with de novo seizures were analyzed in patents without pre-treatment seizures. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis identified that the independent predictors of seizure presentation were unruptured (ruptured vs. unruptured, OR = 0.314), and in the frontal (frontal vs. parietal, OR = 3.982) or temporal lobe (temporal vs parietal, OR = 3.313). In 47 patients with seizure presentation, good seizure outcomes were achieved in 26 cases. Partial obliteration of nidus (partial vs complete, OR = 32.301) and headache presentation were independent predictors of poor outcome. In 169 patients without seizure presentation, de novo seizures occurred in 22 cases. Treatments of microsurgery or radiosurgery led to a higher incidence of de novo seizures than intravascular embolization. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with unruptured and frontal/temporal lobe located nidus were more likely to manifest seizure presentation. Incomplete nidus obliteration was an independent risk factor of poor outcomes in patients with pre-existing seizures. However, compared to microsurgery or radiosurgery, endovascular embolization was less likely to cause de novo seizures in patients without pre-existing seizures.",2023 Apr,2023,The International journal of neuroscience,133,4,356-364,eng,False,10.1080/00207454.2021.1921765;10.1080/00207454.2021.1921765,Journal Article,Humans;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/epidemiology/therapy;Seizures/epidemiology/etiology/therapy;Risk Factors;Temporal Lobe;*Radiosurgery,Seizure;arteriovenous malformation;brain
12142099,An analysis of the dose-response for arteriovenous malformation radiosurgery and other factors affecting obliteration.,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to better understand arteriovenous malformation (AVM) obliteration rates after radiosurgery. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We studied obliteration after Gamma knife radiosurgery in 351 AVM patients with 3-11 years of follow-up imaging. The median marginal dose was 20 Gy (range: 12-30) and median treatment volume was 5.7 cm(3) (range: 0.26-24). Stereotactic targeting was with angiography alone in 250 AVMs, and additional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in 101 AVMs. RESULTS: We documented obliteration by angiography in 193/264 (73%) AVM, and by MR alone in 75/87 (86%) AVM for a 75% corrected obliteration rate. We identified persistent out-of-field nidus in 18% of embolized vs. 5% of non-embolized patients, (P = 0.006). Multivariate analysis correlated in-field obliteration with marginal dose (P < 0.0001) and sex (P < or = 0.026, but not for overall obliteration P = 0.19). A mathematical dose-response model for overall obliteration was constructed to generate a dose-response curve for AVM obliteration with a maximum overall obliteration rate of 88% and minimal improvement above 25 Gy. We could not define the value of alpha/beta for AVM obliteration to a level of statistical significance. CONCLUSION: The rate of AVM obliteration from radiosurgery depends on the marginal dose administered with a dose-response curve that reaches a maximum of approximately 88%. The dose-response plateau reflects problems with target definition which is made more difficult by prior embolization.",2002 Jun,2002,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic,63,3,347-54,eng,True,S0167814002001032;10.1016/s0167-8140(02)00103-2,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Cerebral Angiography;Child;Child, Preschool;Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Logistic Models;Male;Middle Aged;*Radiosurgery;Treatment Outcome",
15662780,Gamma knife surgery for arteriovenous malformations involving the corpus callosum.,"OBJECT: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of gamma knife surgery (GKS) for the treatment of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) involving the corpus callosum. METHODS: Thirty-two patients aged from 7 to 65 years (median 25 years) with AVMs of the corpus callosum underwent GKS between 1990 and 2002. The maximum AVM diameter was more than 3 cm in 11 patients (34%). The AVM volume ranged from 0.1 to 19.1 cm3 (median 1.6 cm3). The median dose to the AVM margin was 20 Gy (range 17-28 Gy). Patients were followed for 1 to 12 years (median 9 years). The angiographically confirmed actuarial obliteration rate was 64% and 74% at 4 and 6 years, respectively. Younger patient age (p < 0.05) and lower radiosurgery-based grading score (calculated from the patient age and AVM volume; p < 0.01) were the significant factors affecting successful AVM obliteration. No patient suffered a hemorrhage after GKS, although 28 patients (88%) had a history of hemorrhage from their AVMs. Radiation-induced neurological deficit was observed only in one patient (3%) who had undergone previous radiotherapy (50 Gy). No patient experienced complications of occlusion or stenosis of the normal vascular structures adjacent to the AVM. CONCLUSIONS: Gamma knife surgery is a safe and effective treatment for selected patients with AVMs involving the corpus callosum, and it carries a low risk of damaging adjacent critical vascular structures. Even ruptured AVMs with relatively large diameter can be successfully treated, especially in younger patients, with minimal morbidity and a low risk of repeated hemorrhage.",2005 Jan,2005,Journal of neurosurgery,102 Suppl,,49-52,eng,False,10.3171/jns.2005.102.s_supplement.0049,Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Cerebral Angiography;Child;Corpus Callosum/*blood supply/diagnostic imaging/pathology/*surgery;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/*instrumentation,
26026628,"Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformations and Epilepsy, Part 2: Predictors of Seizure Outcomes Following Radiosurgery.","OBJECTIVE: Seizure outcomes after arteriovenous malformation (AVM) management with radiosurgery are incompletely understood. In this case-control study, we aim to determine the incidences and define the predictors of seizure improvement and de novo seizures in patients with AVM with and without seizures at presentation, respectively. METHODS: We evaluated our institutional AVM radiosurgery database to determine the factors that were associated with favorable seizure outcome (seizure improvement or lack of de novo seizures). In patients with seizures at presentation, seizure improvement was defined as decreased seizure frequency or complete seizure remission. In patients without seizures at presentation, de novo seizures were defined as new-onset seizures after radiosurgery. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of favorable seizure outcome. RESULTS: In 229 patients with seizures at presentation, the rates of seizure improvement and seizure remission were 57% and 20%, respectively. Prior AVM hemorrhage (P = 0.015), longer follow-up (P < 0.0001), and lack of hemorrhage after radiosurgery (P = 0.048) were independent predictors of seizure improvement in the multivariate analysis. In 778 patients without seizures at presentation, the overall rate of de novo seizures was 1.7%. Prior AVM hemorrhage (P = 0.001) and higher Spetzler-Martin grade (P = 0.018) were independent predictors of the absence of de novo seizures in the multivariate analysis. AVM obliteration was not significantly associated with seizure outcomes after radiosurgery. CONCLUSIONS: Radiosurgery provides reasonable rates of seizure improvement for patients with AVM who present with seizures. For patients with AVM without seizures at presentation, the risk of de novo seizures after radiosurgery is very low, obviating the need for prophylactic antiepileptic drug therapy. Further investigation of epilepsy in patients with AVM undergoing stereotactic radiosurgery should be considered with validated outcome measures and prospective study design.",2015 Sep,2015,World neurosurgery,84,3,653-62,eng,False,S1878-8750(15)00623-3;10.1016/j.wneu.2015.04.064;S1878-8750(15)00623-3;10.1016/j.wneu.2015.04.064,Journal Article,Adult;Case-Control Studies;Cohort Studies;Epilepsy/*epidemiology/etiology;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*complications/epidemiology/*surgery;Intracranial Hemorrhages/complications/epidemiology;Male;Middle Aged;Patient Selection;Prospective Studies;Radiosurgery/*methods;Seizures/*epidemiology/etiology;Treatment Outcome,Epilepsy;Gamma Knife;Intracranial arteriovenous malformations;Neurologic manifestations;Radiosurgery;Seizures;Vascular malformations
25175446,Treatment and outcomes of ARUBA-eligible patients with unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations at a single institution.,"OBJECT: Management of unruptured arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is controversial. In the first randomized trial of unruptured AVMs (A Randomized Trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformations [ARUBA]), medically managed patients had a significantly lower risk of death or stroke and had better outcomes. The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) was one of the participating ARUBA sites. While 473 patients were screened for eligibility, only 4 patients were enrolled in ARUBA. The purpose of this study is to report the treatment and outcomes of all ARUBA-eligible patients at UCSF. METHODS: The authors compared the treatment and outcomes of ARUBA-eligible patients using prospectively collected data from the UCSF brain AVM registry. Similar to ARUBA, they compared the rate of stroke or death in observed and treated patients and used the modified Rankin Scale to grade outcomes. RESULTS: Of 74 patients, 61 received an intervention and 13 were observed. Most treated patients had resection with or without preoperative embolization (43 [70.5%] of 61 patients). One of the 13 observed patients died after AVM hemorrhage. Nine of the 61 treated patients had a stroke or died. There was no significant difference in the rate of stroke or death (HR 1.34, 95% CI 0.12-14.53, p = 0.81) or clinical impairment (Fisher's exact test, p > 0.99) between observed and treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of stroke or death and degree of clinical impairment among treated patients was lower than reported in ARUBA. The authors found no significant difference in outcomes between observed and treated ARUBA-eligible patients at UCSF. Results in ARUBA-eligible patients managed outside that trial led to an entirely different conclusion about AVM intervention, due to the primary role of surgery, judicious surgical selection with established outcome predictors, and technical expertise developed at high-volume AVM centers.",2014 Sep,2014,Neurosurgical focus,37,3,E8,eng,False,10.3171/2014.7.FOCUS14242;10.3171/2014.7.FOCUS14242,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;*Embolization, Therapeutic;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/*therapy;Kaplan-Meier Estimate;Magnetic Resonance Angiography;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Postoperative Complications/mortality/physiopathology;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Tomography Scanners, X-Ray Computed;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult","ARUBA;ARUBA = A Randomized Trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformations;AVM = arteriovenous malformation;UCSF = University of California, San Francisco;arteriovenous malformation;mRS = modified Rankin Scale;microsurgical resection;observation"

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term risks of hemorrhage and late ARE rates in patients with AVM treated with Gamma Knife surgery (GKS). METHODS: We examined 1249 patients with AVM treated with GKS. The Spetzler-Martin grade was I in 313 patients (25%), II in 394 (32%), III in 458 (37%), and IV/V in 84 (7%). The median treatment volume was 2.5 cm3, and the median marginal dose was 20 Gy. RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 61 months. The 5- and 10-year nidus obliteration rates were 63% and 82%, respectively. The 5- and 10-year cumulative hemorrhage rates were 7% and 10%, respectively. The annual hemorrhage rate was 1.5% for the first 5 years post-GKS, which decreased to 0.5% thereafter. During the follow-up period, 42 symptomatic cyst formations/chronic encapsulated hematomas ([CFs/CEHs], 3%) and 3 radiation-induced tumors (0.2%) were observed. The 10- and 15-year cumulative CF/CEH rates were 3.7% and 9.4%, respectively. CONCLUSION: GKS is associated with reduced hemorrhage risk and high nidus obliteration rates in patients with AVM. The incidence of late AREs tended to increase over time. The most common ARE was CF/CEH, which can be safely removed; however, careful attention should be paid to the long-term development of fatal radiation-induced tumors.",2022 Jun 1,2022,Neurosurgery,90,6,784-792,eng,True,10.1227/neu.0000000000001913;00006123-202206000-00017;10.1227/neu.0000000000001913,Journal Article,"Brain/surgery;Follow-Up Studies;Hematoma/surgery;Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications;*Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/complications/surgery;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome",
37198451,Multi-modality treatment approach for paediatric AVMs with quality-of-life outcome measures.,"PURPOSE: Despite the potentially devastating and permanently disabling effects of paediatric arteriovenous malformations (pAVMs), there is a paucity of studies reporting long-term quality-of-life (QoL) outcomes in AVM patients. We aim to evaluate the management strategies for paediatric intracranial pAVMs in the UK and long-term QoL outcomes using a validated paediatric quality-of-life outcome measure. METHODS: In this single-centre case-series, we retrospectively reviewed a prospectively maintained database of all paediatric patients (i.e. 0-18 years old) with intracranial AVMs, who were managed at Alder Hey Children's Hospital from July 2007 to December 2021. We also collected the PedsQL 4.0 score for these patients as a measure of QoL. RESULTS: Fifty-two AVMs were included in our analysis. Forty (80%) were ruptured, 8 (16%) required emergency intervention, 17 (35%) required elective surgery, 15 (30%) underwent endovascular embolisation, and 15 (30%) patients underwent stereotactic radiosurgery. There was an 88% overall obliteration rate. Two (4%) pAVMs rebled, and there were no mortalities. Overall, the mean time from diagnosis to definitive treatment was 144 days (median 119; range 0-586). QoL outcomes were collected for 26 (51%) patients. Ruptured pAVM presentation was associated with worse QoL (p = 0.0008). Location impacted psychosocial scores significantly (71.4, 56.9, and 46.6 for right supratentorial, left supratentorial, and infratentorial, respectively; p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: This study shows a staged multi-modality treatment approach to pAVMs is safe and effective, with superior obliteration rates with surgery alone.

23870021,Definitive treatment of vein of Galen aneurysmal malformation with stereotactic radiosurgery.,"Vein of Galen aneurysmal malformations (VGAMs) are uncommon congenital malformations arising from fistulous communication with the median vein of the prosencephalon, a primitive precursor of midline cerebral venous structures. Angiographic embolization is the primary modality for treatment given historically poor microsurgical outcomes. Only a few reports of treatment by Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) exist in the literature, and the results are variable. The authors present 2 cases of VGAM in which GKRS provided definitive treatment with good outcome: one case involving antenatal presentation of a high-output, mural-type VGAM with complex clinical course refractory to multiple embolic procedures, and the other a choroidal-type VGAM presenting with hemorrhage in an adult and without a feasible embolic approach. With discussion of these cases and review of the literature, the authors advocate inclusion of GKRS as a therapeutic option for treatment of these complex lesions.",2014 Jan,2014,Journal of neurosurgery,120,1,120-5,eng,False,10.3171/2013.6.JNS121897;10.3171/2013.6.JNS121897,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Adult;Cerebral Veins/*abnormalities/diagnostic imaging/surgery;Child, Preschool;Embolization, Therapeutic;Humans;Male;Radiography;Radiosurgery/*instrumentation;Treatment Outcome;Vein of Galen Malformations/diagnostic imaging/*surgery",

They were harboring cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) that had been previously treated with Leksell Gamma Knife radiosurgery, and presented subsequent bleeding 10-52 months after treatment. Light microscopic studies revealed a spindle cell proliferation in the connective tissue stroma and in the subendothelial region of the irradiated AVM vessels. The histological, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural characteristics of the spindle cell population in the Leksell Gamma Knife-treated AVMs are similar to those designated as myofibroblasts in wound healing processes and pathological fibromatoses. Considering that similar cell modifications have not been demonstrated in control, nonirradiated AVM specimens, these myofibroblasts might contribute to the shrinking process and final occlusion of AVMs after radiosurgery.",2007,2007,Progress in neurological surgery,20,,212-219,eng,False,10.1159/000100119;000100119;10.1159/000100119,Journal Article,"Cell Division;Collagen/analysis/ultrastructure;Endothelium, Vascular/pathology;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*pathology/*surgery;Postoperative Period;*Radiosurgery;Stromal Cells/pathology",

METHODS: We used annual general practitioner follow-up, patient questionnaires, and medical records surveillance to quantify the 5-year risk of seizures and the chances of achieving 2-year seizure freedom for adults undergoing AVM treatment compared to adults managed conservatively in a prospective, population-based observational study of adults in Scotland, newly diagnosed with an AVM in 1999-2003. RESULTS: We identified 229 adults with a new diagnosis of an AVM, of whom two-thirds received AVM treatment (154/229; 67%) during 1,862 person-years of follow-up (median completeness of follow-up 97%). There was no significant difference in the proportions with a first or recurrent seizure over 5 years following AVM treatment, compared to the first 5 years following clinical presentation in conservatively managed adults, in analyses stratified by mode of presentation (intracerebral hemorrhage, 35% vs 26%, p = 0.5; seizure, 67% vs 72%, p = 0.6; incidental, 21% vs 10%, p = 0.4). For patients with epilepsy, the chances of achieving 2-year seizure freedom during 5-year follow-up were similar following AVM treatment (n = 39; 52%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 36% to 68%) or conservative management (n = 21; 57%, 95% CI 35% to 79%; p = 0.7).

17621017,Microsurgery or radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations? A study of two paired series.,"OBJECTIVE: To detect parameters that may augment the therapeutic strategy in patients with a cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) that is considered equally suitable for treatment by neurosurgery or radiosurgery, we compared the efficacy and risks of these two methods in a paired series with similar patient and AVM characteristics. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two series of patients with AVM were studied, including a series of 39 patients treated using microsurgery (MS) and another series of 39 patients treated via radiosurgery (RS). These series were paired for age and sex, initial symptoms, size, location and Spetzler-Martin grade, and presence of embolization preceding treatment. We compared the posttreatment outcome in the two groups with respect to obliteration rate, neurological status, mortality rate, and recurrent bleeding. Statistical analysis was performed using paired Student's t test. RESULTS: The Glasgow Outcome Scale values and Modified Rankin Scores measured at discharge and 12 to 24 months were significantly better in the RS series than in the MS series. The obliteration rate tended to be higher in the MS series (91% versus 81%; P = 0.10, not significant), whereas the rate of neurological deficit was higher in the MS series than in the RS series (P < 0.001). The mortality rate was not significantly different in the two series, but the rate of recurrent bleeding was higher in the RS group (10% versus 0%; P = 0.04).

OBJECTIVE: To review the long-term outcomes of intracranial AVMs treated with microsurgical resections. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 445 patients with intracranial AVMs treated in our hospital from January 1st, 2008 to December 31st, 2014. The extracted data included demographic characteristics, clinical presentations, Spetzler-Martin (SM) grades, Supplemented Spetzler-Martin (SM-Supp) Grades, treatment modalities, long-term outcomes, and obliteration rates. Outcome was assessed with a post-operative modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at the last follow-up visit. RESULTS: Of the 445 patients treated with microsurgery, 298 (67.0%) patients initially presented with hemorrhage. Based on the SM grading system, the patients were graded as follows: 83(18.6%) Grade I, 156(35.1%) Grade II, 132(29.7%) Grade III, 61(13.7%) Grade IV and 13(2.9%) Grade V. Overall, 344(77.3%) patients had a favorable outcome (mRS score of 0-2). The favorable outcome for Grade I and II were 92.8% and 85.9%, respectively, sharply reducing to 52.5% in patients with Grade IV and 15.4% in patients with Grade V AVMs. 388(87.2%) patients achieved complete obliteration of the AVMs. 63(14.2%) patients experienced recurrent hemorrhage, and the frequency of rehemorrhage was highest in Grade V patients (77.0%), dropping to 3.6% and 3.8% in patients with Grade I and II lesions, respectively. Permanent neurological deficits occurred in 66(14.8%) patients and death in 35(7.9%) patients. There was no difference of AUROC values between SM grading system and SM-supp grading system (0.726 and 0.734, respectively, p = .715).

12762874,Patient outcomes after arteriovenous malformation radiosurgical management: results based on a 5- to 14-year follow-up study.,"OBJECTIVE: Radiosurgery is commonly performed for patients with small to medium-sized arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). However, few articles present overall outcomes after one or more radiosurgical procedures, and few data are available for periods longer than 5 years after AVM radiosurgery. METHODS: Between 1990 and 1997, 144 patients underwent AVM radiosurgery and had angiographic follow-up. Of these patients, 112 (78%) had Spetzler-Martin Grade III or greater AVMs; 37 (26%) were located in the basal ganglia, thalamus, or brainstem. Twenty-six patients (18%) underwent repeat radiosurgery. The mean follow-up of 15 patients who died as a result of AVM bleeding or underwent AVM resection after the initial radiosurgery was 22 months (range, 3-47 mo); the mean follow-up of the remaining 129 patients was 86 months (range, 23-169 mo). RESULTS: Excellent (obliteration without deficit, n = 96) or good (obliteration with minor deficit, n = 9) outcomes were achieved in 73% of patients after one or more radiosurgical procedures. Twenty patients (14%) sustained major deficits (n = 15; five had obliteration) or died (n = 5) after radiosurgery. Sixteen patients (11%) had unchanged neurological examinations but persistent arteriovenous shunting. Five patients (4%) required surgery (cystoperitoneal shunting, n = 1; AVM resection, n = 4) at a median of 65 months after radiosurgery because of symptomatic cyst formation or persistent edema. The radiosurgery AVM score correlated with both excellent (R(2) = -0.93, P = 0.003) and excellent or good (R(2) = -0.92, P = 0.004) outcomes. CONCLUSION: The majority of AVM patients are protected from the risk of future hemorrhage and continue their normal daily activities after radiosurgery. Late complications requiring treatment are rare but can occur many years after patients are considered cured of their AVMs. Overall outcomes after AVM radiosurgery seem to be predicted accurately by the described method.",2003 Jun,2003,Neurosurgery,52,6,1291-6; discussion 1296-7,eng,True,10.1227/01.neu.0000064800.26214.fe,Evaluation Study;Journal Article,"Adult;Cerebral Angiography;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/mortality/*surgery;*Outcome Assessment, Health Care;*Postoperative Complications;Predictive Value of Tests;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects;Reoperation/adverse effects;Severity of Illness Index;Survival Rate;Time Factors;Treatment Failure",

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the results of a consecutive series of patients with unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVMs), including a subgroup analysis of ARUBA-eligible patients. METHODS: One hundred five patients with unruptured BAVMs were treated over an 8-year period. From this series, 90 adult patients and a subgroup of 61 patients determined to be ARUBA eligible were retrospectively reviewed. A subgroup analysis for Spetzler-Martin grades I/II, III, and IV/V was performed. The modified Rankin Scale was used to assess functional outcome. RESULTS: Persistent deficits, modified Rankin Scale score deterioration, and impaired functional outcome occurred less frequently in ARUBA-eligible grade I/II patients compared with grade III to V patients combined (P = .04, P = .04, P = .03, respectively). Twenty-two of 39 patients (56%) unruptured grade I and II BAVMs were treated with surgery without and with preoperative embolization, and all had a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 1 at the last follow-up. All patients treated with surgery without and with preoperative embolization had radiographic cure at the last follow-up. CONCLUSION: The results of ARUBA-eligible and unruptured grade I/II patients overall show that excellent outcomes can be obtained in this subgroup of patients, especially with surgical management. Functional outcomes for ARUBA-eligible patients were similar to those of patients who were randomized to medical management in ARUBA.

28232387,Intracranial papillary endothelial hyperplasia (Masson's tumour) following gamma knife radiosurgery for temporal lobe epilepsy.,"We present a rare case of intracranial papillary endothelial hyperplasia, or 'Masson's tumour,' following gamma knife radiosurgery for epilepsy. A 59-year-old woman presented with a 4-month history of escalating headaches and progressive neurological deficit. MR scan of brain showed enlargement of an enhancing right temporal lobe lesion, midline shift and obstructive hydrocephalus. She had previously undergone non-curative gamma knife radiosurgery at the age of 44 years for medically refractory complex partial seizures.

22459685,Radiosurgery for unruptured cerebral arteriovenous malformations: long-term seizure outcome.,"OBJECTIVE: To date, seizures in relation to arteriovenous malformations (AVM) have been a secondary target of most studies. The insufficient evaluation, in conjunction with the lack of consistent seizure outcome assessment, has made it been difficult to draw conclusions about seizure outcome after radiosurgery for AVM. This study aimed to determine the effect of radiosurgery on seizure outcome depending on AVM obliteration and on the development of new seizure in patients with AVM. METHODS: Between 1997 and 2006, 161 consecutive patients underwent radiosurgery for unruptured AVM and were retrospectively assessed with a mean follow-up of 89.8 months by their medical records, updated clinical information, and, when necessary, direct patient contact. Seizure outcome was assessed using the Engel seizure frequency scoring system. RESULTS: Of the 86 patients with a history of seizure before radiosurgery, 76.7% (66/86) were seizure-free and 58.1% (50/86) were medication-free at the last follow-up visit. Of the patients who achieved AVM obliteration, 96.7% (58/60) were seizure-free while 30.8% (8/26) of those patients who did not achieve AVM obliteration were seizure-free (p = 0.001). The proportion of patients who were medication-free was 81.7% (49/60) of the patients with obliteration and 3.8% (1/26) of patients without obliteration (p < 0.001). Of the 75 patients with no history of seizure before radiosurgery, 10 had provoked seizures due to the direct and indirect radiosurgical influences after radiosurgery. CONCLUSIONS: Although radiosurgery tends to cause seizures temporarily, the radiosurgery may improve seizure outcomes in patients with AVM-related seizures, especially in patients with AVM obliteration.",2012 Apr 24,2012,Neurology,78,17,1292-8,eng,True,10.1212/WNL.0b013e31825182c5;WNL.0b013e31825182c5;10.1212/WNL.0b013e31825182c5,Journal Article,Causality;Cerebral Hemorrhage/epidemiology;Comorbidity;Disease-Free Survival;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*epidemiology/*surgery;Radiosurgery/adverse effects;Retrospective Studies;Seizures/*epidemiology/etiology/*prevention & control;Treatment Outcome,
36805316,A comparison of incidental and symptomatic unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations in children.,"OBJECTIVE: Patients with unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) may present with headaches, seizures, and/or neurological deficits. A smaller number of cases may be discovered incidentally. These lesions remain incompletely understood due to their sparse reporting. Herein, the authors describe the largest series to date comparing the presentation, angioarchitecture, and management of incidental versus symptomatic unruptured AVMs in children. METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective analysis of patients who presented with brain AVMs from 1998 to 2022 at the University of California, San Francisco. Inclusion criteria were age ≤ 18 years at the time of presentation and an angiographically proven unruptured AVM that had been diagnosed postnatally. RESULTS: Of 76 children with unruptured AVMs, 66 (86.8%) presented with headaches, seizures, and/or neurological deficit. Ten AVMs (13.1%) were incidentally discovered through unrelated disease workup (50%), cranial trauma (40%), or research study participation (10%). Compared with patients with symptomatic unruptured AVMs, patients with incidental unruptured AVMs had a smaller mean ± SD maximum nidus diameter (2.82 ± 1.1 vs 3.98 ± 1.52 cm, p = 0.025) and fewer had deep venous drainage (20% of patients vs 61%, p = 0.036). They also presented at an earlier age (10 ± 5.2 vs 13.5 ± 4 years, p = 0.043) and with longer duration to first treatment (541 ± 922 vs 196 ± 448 days, p = 0.005). During the observation period, 1 patient developed recurring headaches and demonstrated AVM nidus growth. Four AVMs greater than 3 cm in size or in a deep location were treated with radiosurgery. Six other AVMs were treated with resection, with 2 receiving preoperative embolization. Eight AVMs (80%) were obliterated on last follow-up. Postprocedural complications included 2 transient neurological deficits after resection and 1 case of delayed seizure development after radiosurgery. The mean follow-up period was 5.7 ± 5.7 years without any hemorrhage episodes. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of pediatric patients with unruptured AVMs are discovered incidentally. With earlier presentation and more elementary angioarchitecture than symptomatic unruptured AVMs, these incidental lesions provide a snapshot into the natural history of AVM before symptom development or rupture.",2023 May 1,2023,Journal of neurosurgery.

15843732,Dosimetric accuracy of a staged radiosurgery treatment.,"For large cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), the efficacy of radiosurgery is limited since the large doses necessary to produce obliteration may increase the risk of radiation necrosis to unacceptable levels. An alternative is to stage the radiosurgery procedure over multiple stages (usually two), effectively irradiating a smaller volume of the AVM nidus with a therapeutic dose during each session. The difference between coordinate systems defined by sequential stereotactic frame placements can be represented by a translation and a rotation. A unique transformation can be determined based on the coordinates of several fiducial markers fixed to the skull and imaged in each stereotactic coordinate system. Using this transformation matrix, isocentre coordinates from the first stage can be displayed in the coordinate system of subsequent stages allowing computation of a combined dose distribution covering the entire AVM. The accuracy of this approach was tested on an anthropomorphic head phantom and was verified dosimetrically. Subtle defects in the phantom were used as control points, and 2 mm diameter steel balls attached to the surface were used as fiducial markers and reference points. CT images (2 mm thick) were acquired. Using a transformation matrix developed with two frame placements, the predicted locations of control and reference points had an average error of 0.6 mm near the fiducial markers and 1.0 mm near the control points. Dose distributions in a staged treatment approach were accurately calculated using the transformation matrix. This approach is simple, fast and accurate. Errors were small and clinically acceptable for Gamma Knife radiosurgery. Accuracy can be improved by reducing the CT slice thickness.",2005 May 7,2005,Physics in medicine and biology,50,9,1991-2002,eng,False,S0031-9155(05)90248-0;10.1088/0031-9155/50/9/005,Evaluation Study;Journal Article;Validation Study,"*Algorithms;*Dose Fractionation, Radiation;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional/*methods;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/radiotherapy;Phantoms, Imaging;Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted/*methods;Radiometry/*methods;Radiosurgery/*methods;Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted/*methods;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*methods",
23605372,Resection of lateral temporal lobe arteriovenous malformations.,"BACKGROUND: Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) can be formidable lesions to treat. There are four modalities available for treatment: expectant management, radiosurgery, embolization, and microsurgery. In order to make a decision about treatment, the surgeon must consider the natural history of the lesion versus the rate of treated morbidity and mortality. Characteristics of temporal lobe AVMs such as their location, the potential for deep-seated arterial feeders and deep venous drainage, increase the risk of early clinical onset, hemorrhage, and overall morbidity and mortality (Fleetwood and Steinberg; Lancet 359:863-873, 3) and provide an additional challenge to surgeons attempting to remove the lesion while preserving eloquent local structures. METHODS: In this paper, we demonstrate our technique for the microsurgical resection of lateral temporal lobe AVMs. In order to maximize access to the lesion for safe resection, a large craniotomy is utilized, with the malformation separated from the MCA feeding arteries and underlying cortex, with care taken not to compromise en passage vessels. The entire nidus is resected and intraoperative angiography confirms appropriate resection. CONCLUSIONS: Microsurgical resection remains an important part of the treatment paradigm for temporal lobe AVMs. In appropriately selected patients, this can be done with minimal morbidity.",2013 Aug,2013,Acta neurochirurgica,155,8,1565-9,eng,False,10.1007/s00701-013-1710-4;10.1007/s00701-013-1710-4,Journal Article,"Cerebral Angiography/methods;Cerebral Hemorrhage/*surgery;*Embolization, Therapeutic/methods;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/pathology/*surgery;Microsurgery/methods;Radiosurgery/methods;Risk;Temporal Lobe/blood supply/*surgery;Treatment Outcome",
22120337,Hemodynamic changes in arteriovenous malformations after radiosurgery: transcranial Doppler evaluation.,"OBJECTIVE: To monitor hemodynamic changes using transcranial Doppler (TCD) in patients with an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) after Gamma Knife surgery (GKS). METHODS: The study comprised 22 patients (17 men and 6 women, mean age 42 years, range 18-69 years) with an unruptured AVM fed by only the middle cerebral artery (MCA) or its branches. Serial TCD profiles from proximal MCAs were analyzed and correlated with treatment outcome. RESULTS: Baseline TCD measurements (presented as means ± standard deviations) revealed significantly higher mean blood flow velocity (Vm) and lower mean pulsatility index (PI) in MCAs ipsilateral to AVMs than in contralateral MCAs (Vm 102 cm/s ± 29 vs 66 cm/s ± 16, P < 0.05; PI 0.63 ± 0.10 vs 0.84 ± 0.10, P < .05). No correlation was found between AVM volumes and hemodynamic indices. Vm values in ipsilateral MCAs were lower at 6 months (88 cm/s ± 26) after GKS than at baseline (P < 0.05). At 2 years after GKS, a further decrease in mean Vm and an increase in mean PI were observed in ipsilateral MCAs, which then approximated the values of contralateral MCAs (Vm 71 cm/s ± 30 vs 61 cm/s ± 11, P = 0.16; PI 0.76 ± 0.17 vs 0.83 ± 0.14, P = 0.15). Cerebral angiography (CAG) at the same time revealed total obliteration of AVMs in 11 patients. Changes in Vm and PI values were found to be correlated with the completeness of obliteration. However, no correlation was found between baseline TCD measurements and level of obliteration. CONCLUSIONS: Normalization of hemodynamic indices measured by TCD was found to be correlated with AVM obliteration after GKS. However, significant hemodynamic improvements may develop after GKS before obvious obliteration by anatomic imaging.",2012 Feb,2012,World neurosurgery,77,2,316-21,eng,False,10.1016/j.wneu.2011.06.061;S1878-8750(11)00873-4;10.1016/j.wneu.2011.06.061,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Cerebral Angiography;Cerebrovascular Circulation/physiology;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Functional Laterality/physiology;Hemodynamics/*physiology;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic;Magnetic Resonance Angiography;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Middle Cerebral Artery/physiopathology;Radiosurgery/*methods;Treatment Outcome;Ultrasonography, Doppler, Transcranial/*methods;Vascular Resistance;Young Adult",
12182768,Results of multimodality treatment for 141 patients with brain arteriovenous malformations and seizures: factors associated with seizure incidence and seizure outcomes.,"OBJECTIVE: Previous reports of seizure outcomes after arteriovenous malformation (AVM) treatment have involved single-treatment modality (surgery, radiosurgery, or embolization) series. Such series reflect only selected lesions, of certain sizes, locations, and other clinical and anatomic characteristics, that are amenable to the single therapy, limiting the analysis of those factors. We report the results of AVM treatment using a multimodality approach that we think encompasses a broader spectrum of treatable brain AVMs. We tested for factors associated with seizure presentation and seizure outcomes. METHODS: Between 1991 and 1999, the multidisciplinary neurovascular unit at Massachusetts General Hospital treated 424 patients with brain AVMs. Treatment consisted of surgical resection, radiosurgery, or embolization, either alone or in combination. One hundred forty-one patients (33%) experienced seizures before treatment. We studied the following factors: sex, age, AVM size, AVM location, occurrence of intracranial hemorrhage, seizure type, duration of seizure history, treatment modality, and AVM obliteration. We tested for statistical associations between these factors and seizure presentation and outcomes. Clinical follow-up monitoring was via mailed questionnaires. RESULTS: When we compared the 141 patients with seizures with the 283 patients who did not experience seizures (total of 424 patients), male sex, age of less than 65 years, AVM size of more than 3 cm, and temporal lobe AVM location were statistically associated with seizures (P < 0.01, P < 0.05, P < 0.0001, and P < 0.01, respectively). Posterior fossa and deep locations were statistically associated with no seizures (P < 0.0001). One hundred ten (78%) of the 141 patients who experienced seizures before treatment responded to the mailed questionnaires, with a mean follow-up period of 2.9 years. A detailed comparison of responders and nonresponders demonstrated no statistically significant differences in pertinent characteristics. As determined with the Engel Seizure Outcome Scale, there were 73 (66%) Class I (free of disabling seizures), 11 (10%) Class II (rare disabling seizures), 1 (0.9%) Class III (worthwhile improvement), and 22 (20%) Class IV (no worthwhile improvement) outcomes. Three patients died during the follow-up period. We tested for factors associated with Engel Class I outcomes. Sex, age, and AVM size were not associated with Class I outcomes. Short seizure history, association of seizures with intracranial hemorrhage, generalized tonicoclonic seizure type, deep and posterior fossa AVM locations, surgical resection, and complete AVM obliteration were statistically associated with Class I outcomes (P < 0.0001, P < 0.05, P < 0.05, P < 0.05, P < 0.001, and P < 0.001, respectively). When only completely obliterated AVMs were considered, there were no statistically significant differences between surgery, radiosurgery, and embolization. CONCLUSION: Certain factors, as identified in an analysis of a wide spectrum of treatable brain AVMs, can facilitate predictions of the incidence of seizure presentation with AVMs, as well as seizure outcomes after multimodality treatment.",2002 Aug,2002,Neurosurgery,51,2,303-9; discussion 309-11,eng,False,,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Child;Combined Modality Therapy;Embolization, Therapeutic;Epilepsy/*etiology/*therapy;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*complications;Male;Middle Aged;Neurosurgical Procedures;Radiosurgery;Risk Factors;Treatment Outcome",
22077451,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations, Part 4: management of basal ganglia and thalamus arteriovenous malformations.","OBJECT: The authors conducted a study to define the long-term outcomes and risks of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the basal ganglia and thalamus. METHODS: Between 1987 and 2006, the authors performed Gamma Knife surgery in 996 patients with brain AVMs; 56 patients had AVMs of the basal ganglia and 77 had AVMs of the thalamus. In this series, 113 (85%) of 133 patients had a prior hemorrhage. The median target volume was 2.7 cm(3) (range 0.1-20.7 cm(3)) and the median margin dose was 20 Gy (range 15-25 Gy). RESULTS: Obliteration of the AVM eventually was documented on MR imaging in 78 patients and on angiography in 63 patients in a median follow-up period of 61 months (range 2-265 months). The actuarial rates documenting total obliteration after radiosurgery were 57%, 70%, 72%, and 72% at 3, 4, 5, and 10 years, respectively. Factors associated with a higher rate of AVM obliteration included AVMs located in the basal ganglia, a smaller target volume, a smaller maximum diameter, and a higher margin dose. Fifteen (11%) of 133 patients suffered a hemorrhage during the latency period and 7 patients died. The rate of post-SRS AVM hemorrhage was 4.5%, 6.2%, 9.0%, 11.2%, and 15.4% at 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 years, respectively. The overall annual hemorrhage rate was 4.7%. When 5 patients with 7 hemorrhages occurring earlier than 6 months after SRS were removed from this analysis, the annual hemorrhage rate decreased to 2.7%. Larger volume AVMs had a higher risk of hemorrhage after SRS. Permanent neurological deficits due to adverse radiation effects (AREs) developed in 6 patients (4.5%), and in 1 patient a delayed cyst developed 56 months after SRS. No patient died of AREs. Factors associated with a higher risk of symptomatic AREs were larger target volume, larger maximum diameter, lower margin dose, and a higher Pollock-Flickinger score. CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic radiosurgery is a gradually effective and relatively safe management option for deep-seated AVMs in the basal ganglia and thalamus. Although hemorrhage after obliteration did not occur in the present series, patients remain at risk during the latency interval between SRS and obliteration. The best candidates for SRS are patients with smaller volume AVMs located in the basal ganglia.",2012 Jan,2012,Journal of neurosurgery,116,1,33-43,eng,True,10.3171/2011.9.JNS11175;10.3171/2011.9.JNS11175,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Basal Ganglia/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Cerebral Angiography;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/*instrumentation;Retrospective Studies;Thalamus/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Treatment Outcome",
20190666,A supplementary grading scale for selecting patients with brain arteriovenous malformations for surgery.,"BACKGROUND: Patient age, hemorrhagic presentation, nidal diffuseness, and deep perforating artery supply are important factors when selecting patients with brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) for surgery. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that these factors outside of the Spetzler-Martin grading system could be combined into a simple, supplementary grading system that would accurately predict neurologic outcome and refine patient selection. METHODS: A consecutive, single-surgeon series of 300 patients with AVMs treated microsurgically was analyzed in terms of change between preoperative and final postoperative modified Rankin Scale scores. Three different multivariable logistic models (full, Spetzler-Martin, and supplementary models) were constructed to test the association of combined predictor variables with the change in modified Rankin Scale score. A simplified supplementary grading system was developed from the data with points assigned according to each variable and added together for a supplementary AVM grade. RESULTS: Predictive accuracy was highest for the full multivariable model (receiver operating characteristic curve area, 0.78), followed by the supplementary model (0.73), and least for the Spetzler-Martin model (0.66). Predictive accuracy of the simplified supplementary grade was significantly better than that of the Spetzler-Martin grade (P = .042), with receiver operating characteristic curve areas of 0.73 and 0.65, respectively. CONCLUSION: This new AVM grading system supplements rather than replaces the well-established Spetzler-Martin grading system and is a better predictor of neurologic outcomes after AVM surgery. The supplementary grading scale has high predictive accuracy on its own and stratifies surgical risk more evenly. The supplementary grading system is easily applicable at the bedside, where it is intended to improve preoperative risk prediction and patient selection for surgery.",2010 Apr,2010,Neurosurgery,66,4,702-13; discussion 713,eng,False,10.1227/01.NEU.0000367555.16733.E1;10.1227/01.NEU.0000367555.16733.E1,"Journal Article;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural","Adult;Arteriovenous Fistula/*diagnosis/*surgery;Embolization, Therapeutic/methods;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnosis/*surgery;Logistic Models;Male;Outcome Assessment, Health Care/*methods;Predictive Value of Tests;ROC Curve;Radiosurgery/methods;Retrospective Studies;*Severity of Illness Index;Young Adult",

17327789,Radiosurgery to reduce the risk of first hemorrhage from brain arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVE: It remains unclear whether or not and to what extent stereotactic radiosurgery can reduce the risk of first intracranial hemorrhage from brain arteriovenous malformations. METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational investigation of 500 patients with arteriovenous malformations who were treated with gamma knife radiosurgery. The risk of first hemorrhage was analyzed using the Cox proportional-hazards model with age at radiosurgery and angiographic obliteration included as time-dependent covariates. Three periods were defined: from birth to radiosurgery (before radiosurgery); from radiosurgery to angiographic obliteration (latency period); and from angiographic obliteration to end of the follow-up period (after obliteration). RESULTS: Hemorrhage was documented before radiosurgery in 318 patients (median observation period, 30.0 yr), during the latency period in 11 patients (median observation period, 2.2 yr), and after obliteration in two patients (median observation period, 5.5 yr). Compared with the period before radiosurgery, the risk of hemorrhage decreased by 86% after obliteration (hazard ratio, 0.14; 95% confidence interval, 0.03-0.55; P = 0.005), whereas the reduction observed during the latency period was not statistically significant (hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.31-1.04; P = 0.07). Irrespective of obliteration, the risk of hemorrhage decreased by 62% after radiosurgery (hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% confidence interval, 0.22-0.67; P = 0.001). Similar results were observed when the 33 patients who had undergone previous therapy were excluded from the analysis. CONCLUSION: Stereotactic radiosurgery significantly reduces the risk of first hemorrhage from brain arteriovenous malformations.

18503332,Long-term results of Gamma Knife surgery for arteriovenous malformations: 10- to 15-year follow up in patients treated with lower doses.,"OBJECT: Several adverse effects such as brain edema, necrosis, arterial stenosis, hemorrhage after obliteration, and delayed cyst formation have been reported as early and late complications of Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) for arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). These adverse effects seem to be decreased in a lower-dose treatment regimen compared with the classic higher margin doses of 25 Gy because the radiation insult to the surrounding tissue is minimized. Long-term results of lower-dose GKS for AVMs are presented. METHODS: One hundred fourteen patients with AVMs were treated with lower-dose GKS (< or = 20-Gy margin dose). There were 68 male and 46 female patients, aged 10 to 68 years (mean 35.4 years). The evaluation of AVM nidi and dose planning were performed using both angiography and MR imaging in all cases to exclude the surrounding brain tissue. The mean margin dose was 19.5 Gy. Total angiographically documented obliteration was achieved in 65 (85.5%) of 76 patients. Eleven patients underwent a second treatment, including staged treatment for large AVMs; total AVM obliteration has been achieved in six of them to date. Of 38 patients in whom no follow-up examination could be performed, 19 of them were healthy and 10 were lost from follow up. Nine patients experienced bleeding during the latency period, and four of them suffered lethal hemorrhage. Symptomatic early complications were extensive brain edema after repeated GKS in one patient and an adverse effect on the internal capsule in one. Delayed cyst formation was found in one patient as a late complication 10 years after treatment. No treatment-related death has been noted to date. CONCLUSIONS: Lower-dose GKS is an effective and safe treatment for patients with AVMs and may decrease long-term adverse effects to the surrounding brain.",2006 Dec,2006,Journal of neurosurgery,105 Suppl,,64-8,eng,False,10.3171/sup.2006.105.7.64,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Child;Disease-Free Survival;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/diagnosis/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;*Radiosurgery;Radiotherapy Dosage;Time Factors;Young Adult",
35901719,Ischemia-induced inflammation in arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVE: The pathophysiology of development, growth, and rupture of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is only partially understood. However, inflammation is known to play an essential role in many vascular diseases. This feasibility study was conducted to investigate the expression of enzymes (cyclooxygenase 2 [COX-2] and NLRP3 [NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3]) in the AVM nidus that are essential in their inflammatory pathways and to explore how these influence the pathophysiology of AVMs. METHODS: The study group comprised 21 patients with partially thrombosed AVMs. The cohort included 8 ruptured and 13 unruptured AVMs, which had all been treated microsurgically. The formaldehyde-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples were immunohistochemically stained with a monoclonal antibody against COX-2 and NLRP3 (COX-2 clone: CX-294; NLRP3: ab214185). The authors correlated MRI and clinical data with immunohistochemistry, using the Trainable Weka Segmentation algorithm for analysis. RESULTS: The median AVM volume was 2240 mm3. The proportion of NLRP3-positive cells was significantly higher (26.23%-83.95%), compared to COX-2 positive cells (0.25%-14.94%, p < 0.0001). Ruptured AVMs had no higher expression of NLRP3 (p = 0.39) or COX-2 (p = 0.44), compared to nonruptured AVMs. Moreover, no patient characteristics could be reported that showed significant correlations to the enzyme expression. CONCLUSIONS: NLRP3 consistently showed an approximately 10-fold higher expression level than COX-2, making the inflammatory process in AVMs appear to be mainly associated with ischemic (NLRP3)-driven rather than with mechanical (COX-2)-driven inflammatory pathways.

Long-term follow-up data on brain AVM in young patients are rare, making it difficult to compare and evaluate treatment risks and outcomes. METHODS: We studied young patients with brain AVM who were referred to our institution between 2005 and 2012 and for whom follow-up data were available. We stratified the patients into those with ruptured AVM (rAVM) and unruptured AVM (uAVM) and compared treated and nontreated patients. Differences in outcome and social participation were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 29 young patients with brain AVM, median age 16 years, were included in our study with complete follow-up data of over 5 years (mean, 6 years). In 18 (62.1%) patients rAVM and in 11 (37.9%) patients uAVM were found. Twenty (69%) patients received treatment (rAVM 70% vs. uAVM 30%). Among treatment methods, microsurgery was most frequently used (rAVM 33.3% vs. uAVM 36.4%). In rAVM, 16 of 18 (88.9%) patients returned to work or school, and in uAVM, 11 (100%) patients did so. Concerning cognitive problems, no statistically significant difference was found in the 2 groups comparing treated and nontreated patients (P > 0.05). A favorable outcome was achieved in 13 (72.2%) patients with rAVM and in 11 (100%) patients with uAVM. CONCLUSION: Favorable outcome was achieved in the majority of patients. The rate of neurologic improvement and participation in social life was very high in the 2 groups.",2019 Jul,2019,World neurosurgery,127,,e503-e508,eng,False,S1878-8750(19)30867-8;10.1016/j.wneu.2019.03.187;S1878-8750(19)30867-8;10.1016/j.wneu.2019.03.187,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Brain/*surgery;Cerebral Hemorrhage/*surgery;Child;Child, Preschool;Embolization, Therapeutic/methods;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;Radiosurgery/methods;Retrospective Studies;Rupture/*surgery;Time;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",Arteriovenous malformation;Brain AVM;Intracerebral hemorrhage in young patients;Long-term follow-up
10758322,Enhanced in vitro radiosensitivity of skin fibroblasts in two patients developing brain necrosis following AVM radiosurgery: a new risk factor with potential for a predictive assay.,"PURPOSE: Radiosurgery is an effective treatment for arteriovenous malformations (AVM) with a low risk of developing brain necrosis. Models have been developed to predict the risk of complications. We postulated that genetic differences in radiosensitivity may also be a risk factor. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fibroblast cultures were established from skin biopsies in two AVM patients developing radiation necrosis. The results of clonogenic survival assays were compared to a parallel study with two groups of cancer patients treated with radiation: 1) patients without late side effects; 2) patients experiencing severe late sequelae. RESULTS: The survival fraction at 2 Gy (SF2) of the 2 AVM patients was 0.17 (0.14-0.19) and 0.18 (0.14-0.22). The SF2's of the cancer patients ranged between 0.25-0.38 (mean = 0.31) for the control group, and between 0. 10-0.20 (mean = 0.17) for the hypersensitive group. The SF2's of the AVM patients who developed brain necrosis were comparable to that of the hypersensitive group (p = 0.85) but significantly lower than the control group (p = 0.05). CONCLUSION: The two patients who developed radiation necrosis demonstrate increased fibroblast radiosensitivity.

28435119,Linear Accelerator Stereotactic Radiosurgery of Central Nervous System Arteriovenous Malformations: A 15-Year Analysis of Outcome-Related Factors in a Single Tertiary Center.,"BACKGROUND: Linear accelerator stereotactic radiosurgery is one of the modalities available for the treatment of central nervous system arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). The aim of this study was to describe our 15-year experience with this technique in a single tertiary center and the analysis of outcome-related factors. METHODS: From 1998 to 2013, 195 patients were treated with linear accelerator-based radiosurgery; we conducted a retrospective study collecting patient- and AVM-related variables. Treatment outcomes were obliteration, posttreatment hemorrhage, symptomatic radiation-induced changes, and 3-year neurologic status. We also analyzed prognostic factors of each outcome and predictability analysis of 5 scales: Spetzler-Martin grade, Lawton-Young supplementary and Lawton combined scores, radiosurgery-based AVM score, Virginia Radiosurgery AVM Scale, and Heidelberg score. RESULTS: Overall obliteration rate was 81%. Nidus diameter and venous drainage were predictive of obliteration (P < 0.05), ruptured status and previous embolization were not related to rate of obliteration, and low-grade AVMs had higher obliteration rates. Posttreatment hemorrhage incidence was 8.72%; nidus diameter was the only predictor (P = 0.05). Symptomatic radiation-induced changes occurred in 11.79% of patients and were significantly associated with unruptured status (P < 0.05). Treatment success as a composite measure was obtained in 70.77% of patients. Receiver operating characteristic curves were presented for each scoring system and outcome measure; best area under the curve was 0.687 for Lawton combined score in the obliteration outcome.

30922894,[Effects of high-dose irradiation on vascularization: Physiopathology and clinical consequences].,"A review of the literature has been conducted to better understand the effect of stereotactic radiotherapy on tumour vascularization and their consequences. High irradiation doses cause the death of endothelial cells by apoptosis through the ceramide pathway. Vascular consequences are multiple: increased permeability, decreased blood flow, increased hypoxia and tumoral necrosis. This necrosis causes an indirect death of the cancer cells in the days following the irradiation. The importance of indirect cell death in tumour control remains controversial, but it can explain the good clinical results of stereotactic radiotherapy. Stereotactic radiotherapy is a treatment of the tumour microenvironment. Tumour recurrence in this hypoxic environment is slower through disturbance of revascularization mechanisms but also more aggressive, with increased resistance to treatment and a higher risk of metastasis. In a longer time, vascular damage leads to chronic inflammation and a dysfunctional healing process resulting in vascular occlusion. This phenomenon is used in the treatment of arteriovenous malformations but is also responsible for damage to healthy tissues responsible for chronic complications. This is why high-dose irradiation can only be delivered using stereotactic radiotherapy, which reduces the irradiated volume.",2019 Apr,2019,Cancer radiotherapie : journal de la Societe francaise de radiotherapie,23,2,161-167,fre,False,S1278-3218(19)30026-5;10.1016/j.canrad.2018.05.009;S1278-3218(19)30026-5;10.1016/j.canrad.2018.05.009,Journal Article;Review,"Apoptosis;Brain/pathology/radiation effects;Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/pathology/radiotherapy;Microcirculation/radiation effects;Necrosis;Neoplasms/*blood supply/pathology;*Neovascularization, Pathologic;*Radiosurgery;Radiotherapy Dosage",Dommages vasculaires;Radiobiologie;Radiobiology;Radiothérapie stéréotaxique;Stereotactic radiotherapy;Vascular damage
30093482,Adjunctive Efficacy of Intra-Arterial Conebeam CT Angiography Relative to DSA in the Diagnosis and Surgical Planning of Micro-Arteriovenous Malformations.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Micro-arteriovenous malformations are an underrecognized etiology of intracranial hemorrhage. Our study aimed to assess the adjunctive efficacy of intra-arterial conebeam CTA relative to DSA in the diagnosis and surgical planning of intracranial micro-AVMs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of all micro-AVMs (≤1-cm nidus) at our institution. Blinded neuroradiologists qualitatively graded DSA and intra-arterial conebeam CTA images for the detection of specific micro-AVM anatomic parameters (arterial feeder, micronidus, and venous drainer) and defined an overall diagnostic value. Statistical and absolute differences in the overall diagnostic values defined the relative intra-arterial conebeam CTA diagnostic values, respectively. Blinded neurosurgeons reported their treatment approach after DSA and graded the adjunctive value of intra-arterial conebeam CTA to improve or modify treatment. Intra-arterial conebeam CTA efficacy was defined as interobserver agreement in the relative intra-arterial conebeam CTA diagnostic and/or treatment-planning value scores. RESULTS: Ten patients with micro-AVMs presented with neurologic deficits and/or intracranial hemorrhages. Both neuroradiologists assigned a higher overall intra-arterial conebeam CTA diagnostic value (P < .05), secondary to improved evaluation of both arterial feeders and the micronidus, with good interobserver agreement (τ = 0.66, P = .018) in the relative intra-arterial conebeam CTA diagnostic value. Both neurosurgeons reported that integrating the intra-arterial conebeam CTA data into their treatment plan would allow more confident localization for surgical/radiation treatment (8/10; altering the treatment plan in 1 patient), with good interobserver agreement in the relative intra-arterial conebeam CTA treatment planning value (τ = 0.73, P = .025). CONCLUSIONS: Adjunctive intra-arterial conebeam CTA techniques are more effective in the diagnostic identification and anatomic delineation of micro-AVMs, relative to DSA alone, with the potential to improve microsurgical or radiosurgery treatment planning.",2018 Sep,2018,AJNR.

To compare the outcomes of different treatment strategies, we divided 112 patients with 113 AVMs into groups with hemorrhagic (n = 71, 62.8%) and nonhemorrhagic (n = 42, 37.2%) AVMs and subdivided these according to the period in which they were treated (before/after 1990). In the more recent period, treatment more frequently involved the use of the gamma-knife and microembolization to the AVM as well as combination therapy. Long-term follow-up showed that the complication rate was lower and the Rankin scale better, in the more recently treated group.

27509452,Gamma Knife Radiosurgery for Arteriovenous Malformations: Clinical Series of 199 Patients.,"AIM: Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM) are pathological connections between arteries and veins without capillaries. Stereotactic radiosurgery (RS) is a proven and accepted treatment method for cerebral AVMs. Our objective was to analyze the factors influencing the clinical outcome in patients suffering from AVMs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 199 patients who were treated with Gamma-Knife RS for intracranial AVMs between 13 October 2005 and 31 October 2010. There were 89 male, 110 female patients with a median age of 32 years (range, 3-74 years). Obliteration was assessed with MRI angiography and DSA imaging. RESULTS: Complete obliteration rate after RS was 71 % (141 out of 199), including second RS treatments. In terms of obliteration rates, there was no significant difference between patients younger and older than 21 years old (p=0.669). After RS, 3 patients died due to intracranial hemorrhage and 1 died of heart disease. Death from AVM was determined as 1.5 %. Intracranial hemorrhage was observed in 7 (3.5 %) patients post-RS. CONCLUSION: Obliteration was found to be associated with Spetzler-Martin Grade, Pollock-Flickinger Grade, AVM volume, RS dose, bleeding history before RS and no previous embolization before RS. Gamma knife RS is an effective treatment method for the treatment of AVMs both for pediatric and adult patients.

28220368,Embolization of ruptured arteriovenous malformations in the cerebellopontine angle cistern.,"Among brainstem arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), there exist small AVMs predominantly located in the cerebellopontine angle cistern (CPAC) with minimal extension into the pial surface of the brainstem. However, previous studies of CPAC AVMs did not particularly discuss the role of embolization in the treatment of these lesions. This study was conducted to clarify the effectiveness and validity of embolization in the treatment of CPAC AVMs. We retrospectively reviewed five patients with CPAC AVMs who underwent endovascular treatment. These patients were treated with embolization followed by open surgery or gamma knife (GK) radiosurgery. Radiological findings and clinical course for these patients were then assessed. All five patients presented with a hemorrhage. Angiography revealed that the main feeder contained a dilated pontine perforating artery in all cases. Embolization through the dilated pontine perforating artery effectively reduced shunt flow within the nidus or obliterated associated aneurysms. Magnetic resonance imaging showed infarction on the lateral pons in four patients, one of which developed transient mild dizziness and mild ataxia of the right side. Subsequent open surgery was performed in three patients, and GK radiosurgery was performed in two patients without complications. At the end of the follow-up period, all patients demonstrated favorable outcomes. Postoperative rebleeding did not occur in any of the patients. Disappearance of the AVM was confirmed in four patients, except in the one patient treated with GK. Although ischemic complications should be noted, embolization of CPAC AVMs may be an appropriate treatment option to reduce the risk of subsequent surgery or radiosurgery.",2018 Jan,2018,Neurosurgical review,41,1,173-182,eng,False,10.1007/s10143-017-0832-1;10.1007/s10143-017-0832-1;10.1007/s10143-017-0832-1,Journal Article,"Adult;Aged;Cerebellar Diseases/diagnostic imaging/*therapy;*Cerebellopontine Angle;*Embolization, Therapeutic;*Endovascular Procedures;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/*therapy;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Rupture, Spontaneous;Treatment Outcome",Arteriovenous malformation;Cerebellopontine angle;Embolization;Endovascular treatment;Hemorrhage
17937234,Gamma Knife surgery for arteriovenous malformations in the brain: integration of time-resolved contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography into dosimetry planning. Technical note.,"OBJECT: The aim of this study was to develop an algorithm for the integration of time-resolved contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) angiography into dosimetry planning for Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in the brain. METHODS: Twelve patients harboring brain AVMs referred for GKS underwent intraarterial digital subtraction (DS) angiography and time-resolved MR angiography while wearing an externally applied cranial stereotactic frame. Time-resolved MR angiography was performed on a 1.5-tesla MR unit (Achieva, Philips Medical Systems) using contrast-enhanced 3D fast field echo sequencing with stochastic central k-space ordering. Postprocessing with interactive data language (Research Systems, Inc.) produced hybrid data sets containing dynamic angiographic information and the MR markers necessary for stereotactic transformation. Image files were sent to the Leksell GammaPlan system (Elekta) for dosimetry planning. RESULTS: Stereotactic transformation of the hybrid data sets containing the time-resolved MR angiography information with automatic detection of the MR markers was possible in all 12 cases. The stereotactic coordinates of vascular structures predefined from time-resolved MR angiography matched with DS angiography data in all cases. In 10 patients dosimetry planning could be performed based on time-resolved MR angiography data. In two patients, time-resolved MR angiography data alone were considered insufficient. The target volumes showed a notable shift of centers between modalities. CONCLUSIONS: Integration of time-resolved MR angiography data into the Leksell GammaPlan system for patients with brain AVMs is feasible. The proposed algorithm seems concise and sufficiently robust for clinical application. The quality of the time-resolved MR angiography sequencing needs further improvement.",2007 Oct,2007,Journal of neurosurgery,107,4,854-9,eng,False,10.3171/JNS-07/10/0854,"Clinical Trial;Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't;Technical Report","Adolescent;Adult;Algorithms;Angiography, Digital Subtraction;Cerebral Angiography;Contrast Media;Feasibility Studies;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*pathology/*surgery;*Magnetic Resonance Angiography;Male;Middle Aged;*Radiosurgery;Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted/*methods",
23269039,Multimodality treatment for cerebral arteriovenous malformations: complementary role of proton beam radiotherapy.,"A total of 29 cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) treated at the University of Tsukuba with multimodality treatment including proton beam (PB) radiotherapy for cerebral AVMs between 2005 and 2011 were retrospectively evaluated. Eleven AVMs were classified as Spetzler-Martin grades I and II, 10 as grade III, and 8 as grades IV and V. For AVMs smaller than 2.5 cm and located on superficial and non-eloquent areas, surgical removal with/without embolization was offered as a first-line treatment. For some small AVMs located in deep or eloquent lesions, gamma knife (GK) radiosurgery was offered. Some AVMs were treated with only embolization. AVMs larger than 2.5 cm were embolized to achieve reduction in size, to enhance the safety of the surgery, and to render the AVM amenable to GK radiosurgery. For larger AVMs located in deep or eloquent areas, PB radiotherapy was offered with/without embolization. Immediately after the treatment, 24 patients exhibited no neurological worsening. Four patients had moderate disability, and 1 patient had severe disability. Three patients suffered brain damage after surgical resection, and 2 patients suffered embolization complications. However, no neurological worsening was observed after either GK radiosurgery or PB radiotherapy, but 3 patients treated by PB radiotherapy suffered delayed hemorrhage. Fractionated PB radiotherapy for cerebral AVMs seems to be useful for the treatment of large AVMs, but careful long-term follow up is required to establish the efficacy and safety.",2012,2012,Neurologia medico-chirurgica,52,12,859-64,eng,False,DN/JST.JSTAGE/nmc/52.859;10.2176/nmc.52.859,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Cerebral Cortex/blood supply;Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology;Child;Child, Preschool;Combined Modality Therapy;*Embolization, Therapeutic;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Hospitals, University;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/classification/diagnosis/*therapy;Male;Middle Aged;Postoperative Complications/etiology;*Proton Therapy;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Tokyo;Young Adult",
21250805,"Parafalcine and midline arteriovenous malformations: surgical strategy, techniques, and outcomes.","OBJECT: Parafalcine arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) have a midline plane in common, but differ in their location (anterior, middle, or posterior) and depth (superficial or deep). Surgical management varies with AVM location and depth in terms of patient position, head position, craniotomy, and surgical approach. This study examined surgical strategies, patient outcomes, and regional factors influencing results. METHODS: Patients with AVMs located on the medial surface of the cerebral hemisphere were identified retrospectively from a consecutive, single-neurosurgeon series that is registered prospectively as part of the UCSF Brain Arteriovenous Malformation Study Project. During a 12-year period, 443 patients with AVMs were treated surgically. Of these 443 patients, 132 (30%) had parafalcine AVMs, which were distributed in zones as follows: superficial-anterior, 25 (18.9%); superficial-middle, 26 (19.7%); superficial-posterior, 39 (29.5%); deep-anterior, 25 (18.9%); deep-posterior, 17 (12.9%). Five different surgical strategies were used depending on AVM zone. RESULTS: Complete AVM resection was achieved in 123 (93.2%) of 132 patients. Overall, neurological condition improved in 74 patients (56.1%) and remained unchanged in 41 patients (31.1%). Neurological condition deteriorated in 12 patients (9.1%), and 5 patients (3.8%) died. Patients with AVMs in the superficial-middle zone had the highest rate of neurological deterioration (26.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Parafalcine AVMs lie on a midline surface that, when exposed with a bilateral craniotomy across the superior sagittal sinus and a wide opening of the interhemispheric fissure, makes them superficial. However, unlike convexity AVMs, which are approached perpendicularly, parafalcine AVMs are approached tangentially. Gravity retraction is useful with deeply located AVMs (those in the deep-anterior and deep-posterior zones), because it widens the interhemispheric fissure and accesses deep arterial feeding vessels from the anterior and posterior cerebral arteries. Surgical risks were increased in the superficial-middle zone, which is likely explained by the proximity of sensorimotor cortex. The authors' regional classification of parafalcine AVMs may serve as a guide to surgical planning.",2011 Apr,2011,Journal of neurosurgery,114,4,984-93,eng,False,10.3171/2010.12.JNS101297;10.3171/2010.12.JNS101297,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Child;Child, Preschool;Craniotomy;Embolization, Therapeutic;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Infant;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/pathology/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Neurosurgical Procedures/*methods;Radiosurgery;Treatment Outcome;Vascular Surgical Procedures/*methods;Young Adult",

16776373,Radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations in children.,"OBJECT: The authors present the results of stereotactic radiosurgery performed in a consecutive series of children with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and analyze factors associated with successful radiosurgery for this condition. METHODS: Between 1990 and 2001, 38 patients 18 years of age or younger underwent radiosurgery for AVMs. The median patient age was 15 years; 20 patients (53%) had experienced a prior hemorrhage. Twenty-seven AVMs (71%) were Spetzler-Martin Grade III or higher; 16 patients (42%) had AVMs located in the basal ganglia, thalamus, or brainstem. The median AVM volume was 3.4 cm3. The median radiosurgery-based AVM score was 1.08 according to the following formula: AVM score = 0.1 volume (cm3) + 0.02 x age (years) + 0.3 x location (frontal/temporal = 0; parietal/occipital/corpus callosum/cerebellar = 1; basal ganglia/thalamus/brainstem = 2). The median follow-up period was 42 months. One patient (3%) had an intraventricular hemorrhage 26 months after radiosurgery but experienced no new deficit. No patient had a permanent radiation-related complication after radiosurgery. Twenty-six patients (68%) had excellent outcomes (as defined by complete obliteration of the AVM with no new deficit) after radiosurgical treatment (21 cases determined using angiography and five using magnetic resonance imaging). Twelve patients (32%) remained unchanged (incomplete obliteration but no new deficit). Univariate analysis found that patient age, AVM volume, location, or Spetzler-Martin grade did not correlate with excellent outcomes. Patients whose radiosurgery-based AVM scores were 1 or lower experienced an excellent outcome more frequently than patients with an AVM score higher than 1 (88% compared with 52%, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Radiosurgery was successful in the treatment of the majority of pediatric patients suffering from AVMs, and morbidity levels were minimal. The radiosurgery-based AVM grading scale accurately predicted these outcomes. Children whose AVMs are obliterated after radiosurgery should undergo repeated angiography after they reach adulthood to rule out the possibility of a recurrent nidus that would expose them to an ongoing risk of hemorrhage.",2006 Jun,2006,Journal of neurosurgery,104,6 Suppl,388-91,eng,False,10.3171/ped.2006.104.6.388,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Cerebral Angiography;Child;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/pathology/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;*Radiosurgery;Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted;Retrospective Studies;Severity of Illness Index;Treatment Outcome",
25884262,Radiosurgery for temporal lobe arteriovenous malformations: effect of temporal location on seizure outcomes.,"OBJECT: The temporal lobe is particularly susceptible to epileptogenesis. However, the routine use of anticonvulsant therapy is not implemented in temporal lobe AVM patients without seizures at presentation. The goals of this case-control study were to determine the radiosurgical outcomes for temporal lobe AVMs and to define the effect of temporal lobe location on postradiosurgery AVM seizure outcomes. METHODS: From a database of approximately 1400 patients, the authors generated a case cohort from patients with temporal lobe AVMs with at least 2 years follow-up or obliteration. A control cohort with similar baseline AVM characteristics was generated, blinded to outcome, from patients with non-temporal, cortical AVMs. They evaluated the rates and predictors of seizure freedom or decreased seizure frequency in patients with seizures or de novo seizures in those without seizures. RESULTS: A total of 175 temporal lobe AVMs were identified based on the inclusion criteria. Seizure was the presenting symptom in 38% of patients. The median AVM volume was 3.3 cm3, and the Spetzler-Martin grade was III or higher in 39% of cases. The median radiosurgical prescription dose was 22 Gy. At a median clinical follow-up of 73 months, the rates of seizure control and de novo seizures were 62% and 2%, respectively. Prior embolization (p = 0.023) and lower radiosurgical dose (p = 0.027) were significant predictors of seizure control. Neither temporal lobe location (p = 0.187) nor obliteration (p = 0.522) affected seizure outcomes. The cumulative obliteration rate was 63%, which was significantly higher in patients without seizures at presentation (p = 0.046). The rates of symptomatic and permanent radiation-induced changes were 3% and 1%, respectively. The annual risk of postradiosurgery hemorrhage was 1.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Radiosurgery is an effective treatment for temporal lobe AVMs. Furthermore, radiosurgery is protective against seizure progression in patients with temporal lobe AVM-associated seizures. Temporal lobe location does not affect radiosurgery-induced seizure control. The low risk of new-onset seizures in patients with temporal or extratemporal AVMs does not seem to warrant prophylactic use of anticonvulsants.",2015 Oct,2015,Journal of neurosurgery,123,4,924-34,eng,True,10.3171/2014.10.JNS141807;10.3171/2014.10.JNS141807,Clinical Study;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Case-Control Studies;Child;Epilepsy, Temporal Lobe/etiology/*surgery;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Temporal Lobe/*blood supply;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",AED = antiepileptic drug;AVM = arteriovenous malformation;Gamma Knife;MTLE = mesial temporal lobe epilepsy;RBAS = radiosurgery-based AVM score;RIC = radiation-induced change;VRAS = Virginia Radiosurgery AVM Scale;epilepsy;intracranial arteriovenous malformation;seizures;stereotactic radiosurgery;temporal lobe;vascular disorders;vascular malformations
24216063,Neuropsychological outcomes of stereotactic radiotherapy for cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate cognitive outcome in patients with large or surgically inaccessible cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), who were treated with hypo-fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT). A sample of 10 patients with AVMs was assessed up to 3.5 years post-HSRT. All patients were treated with HSRT to a total dose of 55 Gy in 11 fractions over a treatment period of 2.5 weeks. Neuropsychological assessments were given prior to radiotherapy and then at three time points following radiotherapy: 6 weeks, 6 months and 2.5-3.5 years post-treatment. The cognitive domains of attention, processing speed, learning, memory, semantic processing, naming, verbal fluency, visuospatial and executive function were assessed. Findings revealed that prior to radiotherapy the patient group was impaired in five of the nine cognitive domains. Post-treatment performances remained stable in the majority of domains; however, there was some fluctuation in semantic processing and memory performances. At 6 weeks post-treatment, a mild decrement was found in semantic processing ability; however, restoration to baseline levels was observed from 6 months onwards. At 2.5-3.5 years post-treatment, improvement was seen in the cohort's ability to remember new information when performances were compared with earlier time points. This study demonstrated improvements in memory several years after HSRT treatment. Further, this form of treatment was not associated with long-term, harmful cognitive side effects for these 10 patients encouraging further study of this treatment method. Further evaluation of the entire cohort is required to assess efficacy in terms of AVM obliteration and other potential side effects.",2014 Apr,2014,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society,21,4,601-6,eng,False,S0967-5868(13)00459-1;10.1016/j.jocn.2013.08.007;S0967-5868(13)00459-1;10.1016/j.jocn.2013.08.007,Journal Article,"Adult;Angiography, Digital Subtraction;Brain/pathology;Carotid Arteries/diagnostic imaging;Cerebral Angiography;Cognition Disorders/etiology/pathology;Cohort Studies;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Neuropsychological Tests;Psychometrics;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects;Severity of Illness Index;Time Factors;Treatment Outcome",Arteriovenous malformation;Cognition;Follow-up;Radiotherapy

12593620,Salvage retreatment after failure of radiosurgery in patients with arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECT: The goal of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of patients who underwent repeated radiosurgery to treat a residual intracranial arteriovenous malformation (AVM) after an initial radiosurgical treatment failure. METHODS: The authors reviewed the cases of 52 patients who underwent repeated radiosurgery for residual AVM at the University of Florida between December 1991 and June 1998. In each case, residual arteriovenous shunting persisted longer than 36 months after the initial treatment; the mean interval between the first and second treatment was 41 months. Each AVM nidus was measured at the time of the original treatment and again at the time of retreatment, and the dosimetric parameters of the two treatments were compared. After retreatment, patients were followed up and their outcomes were evaluated according to a standard posttreatment protocol for radiosurgery for AVMs. The mean original lesion volume was 13.8 cm3 and the mean volume at retreatment was 4.7 cm3, for an average volume reduction of 66% after the initial treatment failure. Only two AVMs (3.8%) failed to demonstrate size reduction after the primary treatment. The median doses on initial and repeated treatment were 12.5 and 15 Gy, respectively. Five patients were lost to follow up and five refused neuroimaging follow up. One patient died of a hemorrhage shortly after retreatment. Of the remaining 41 patients, 24 had evidence of cure, 15 on angiographic studies and nine on magnetic resonance (MR) images. Seventeen had evidence of treatment failure, 10 on angiographic studies and seven on MR images. By angiographic criteria alone, the cure rate after retreatment was 60%, whereas according to angiographic and MR imaging results, the cure rate was 59%. CONCLUSIONS: Although initial radiosurgical treatment failed to obliterate the AVM in these 52 patients, it did produce a substantial therapeutic effect (volume reduction). This size reduction commonly allowed higher doses to be delivered during radiosurgical retreatment. The results show rates of angiographically confirmed cure comparable to primary treatment and a low incidence of complications, indicating that salvage radiosurgical retreatment is a safe and effective therapy in cases of failed AVM radiosurgery.",2003 Feb,2003,Journal of neurosurgery,98,2,337-41,eng,True,10.3171/jns.2003.98.2.0337,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/pathology/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Angiography;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;*Outcome Assessment, Health Care;Radiography;*Radiosurgery;Retreatment;Retrospective Studies;*Salvage Therapy;Time Factors;Treatment Failure",

METHODS: Twenty-one patients with symptomatic brainstem intra-axial CMs were treated by GKRS between 2005 and 2010. One patient was lost to follow-up. The median age of the patients was 39.5 years (range, 24-69 years). All patients had experienced 1 or more symptomatic hemorrhages before GKRS (range, 1-3). The median marginal radiation dose was 13 Gy, and the median volume of the malformation was 0.56 mL. The median follow-up period after radiosurgery was 32 months (range, 12-82 months; mean, 38.9 months). RESULTS: Before GKRS, 31 hemorrhages (1.55 per patient) were observed. The annual hemorrhage rate before GKRS was 39.5%, excluding the first hemorrhage. After GKRS, 1 hemorrhage (0.05 per patient) was identified. It occurred 6 months after radiosurgery. The patient showed complete recovery to a premorbid status with steroid medication. The annual hemorrhage rate after GKRS was 8.2% for the first 2 years. After the expected latency period, no hemorrhages were identified. One patient (5%) exhibited permanent paresthesia, which was a new neurologic symptom in absence of any hemorrhagic event, after the radiosurgery. CONCLUSIONS: GKRS seems to be relatively effective and safe for reducing the rebleeding rate of brainstem intra-axial CMs that have high surgical risk.

26090838,Pathological response of cavernous malformations following radiosurgery.,"OBJECT: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a therapeutic option for repeatedly hemorrhagic cavernous malformations (CMs) located in areas deemed to be high risk for resection. During the latency period of 2 or more years after SRS, recurrent hemorrhage remains a persistent risk until the obliterative process has finished. The pathological response to SRS has been studied in relatively few patients. The authors of the present study aimed to gain insight into the effect of SRS on CM and to propose possible mechanisms leading to recurrent hemorrhages following SRS. METHODS: During a 13-year interval between 2001 and 2013, bleeding recurred in 9 patients with CMs that had been treated using Gamma Knife surgery at the authors' institution. Microsurgical removal was subsequently performed in 5 of these patients, who had recurrent hemorrhages between 4 months and 7 years after SRS. Specimens from 4 patients were available for analysis and used for this report. RESULTS: Histopathological analysis demonstrated that vascular sclerosis develops as early as 4 months after SRS. In the samples from 2 to 7 years after SRS, sclerotic vessels were prominent, but there were also vessels with incomplete sclerosis as well as some foci of neovascularization. CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent bleeding after SRS for CM could be related to incomplete sclerosis of the vessels, but neovascularization may also play a role.",2015 Oct,2015,Journal of neurosurgery,123,4,938-44,eng,False,10.3171/2014.10.JNS14499;10.3171/2014.10.JNS14499,Case Reports;Clinical Study;Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/*pathology/*surgery;Intracranial Hemorrhages/etiology/surgery;Male;Middle Aged;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult,AVM = arteriovenous malformation;CM = cavernous malformation;MMP-9 = matrix metallopeptidase 9;SRS = stereotactic radiosurgery;VEGF = vascular endothelial growth factor;bFGF = basic fibroblast growth factor;brain hemorrhage;cavernous malformation;stereotactic radiosurgery
25175428,Molecular and cellular biology of cerebral arteriovenous malformations: a review of current concepts and future trends in treatment.,"OBJECT: Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are classically described as congenital static lesions. However, in addition to rupturing, AVMs can undergo growth, remodeling, and regression. These phenomena are directly related to cellular, molecular, and physiological processes. Understanding these relationships is essential to direct future diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. The authors performed a search of the contemporary literature to review current information regarding the molecular and cellular biology of AVMs and how this biology will impact their potential future management. METHODS: A PubMed search was performed using the key words ""genetic,"" ""molecular,"" ""brain,"" ""cerebral,"" ""arteriovenous,"" ""malformation,"" ""rupture,"" ""management,"" ""embolization,"" and ""radiosurgery."" Only English-language papers were considered. The reference lists of all papers selected for full-text assessment were reviewed. RESULTS: Current concepts in genetic polymorphisms, growth factors, angiopoietins, apoptosis, endothelial cells, pathophysiology, clinical syndromes, medical treatment (including tetracycline and microRNA-18a), radiation therapy, endovascular embolization, and surgical treatment as they apply to AVMs are discussed.

29198888,Salvage Therapy for Brain Arteriovenous Malformations After Failure of Gamma Knife Stereotactic Radiosurgery.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate delayed complications in patients with brain arteriovenous malformation (BAVM) after Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery and to present the salvage therapy experiences of patients with BAVM with radiation-induced changes (RICs) or intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). METHODS: This cohort consisted of 44 patients with BAVM who underwent failed GKRS between 2000 and 2015. These patients were further divided into an RIC group (23 patients) and an ICH group (21 patients) based on their post-GKRS complications. The patients' characteristics, treatment strategies, and long-term outcomes were analyzed. The modified Rankin Scale was used to assess the neurologic status of each patient. RESULTS: In our study, the marginal dose and radiosurgery-based arteriovenous malformation score were not significantly different between the 2 groups. Craniotomy was performed in 26 patients (9 patients with ICH and 17 patients with RICs), and histologic examination showed cavernous angioma changes in 6 patients. In addition, 6 patients underwent repeat radiosurgery in the ICH group, and 7 patients used bevacizumab in the RIC group. Thirty patients showed good outcomes at the last follow-up (modified Rankin Scale score <3).

26252461,Gamma Knife surgical treatment for partially embolized cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVE: A combination of embolization and radiosurgery is used as a common strategy for the treatment of large and complex cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). This study presents the experiences of partially embolized cerebral AVMs followed by Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) and assesses predictive factors for AVM obliteration and hemorrhage. METHODS: The interventional neuroradiology database that was reviewed included 404 patients who underwent AVM embolization. Using this database, the authors retrospectively analyzed all partially embolized AVM cases followed by GKS for a residual nidus. Except for cases of complete AVM obliteration, the authors excluded all patients with radiological follow-up of less than 2 years. Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the predictive factors related to AVM obliteration and hemorrhage following GKS. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to evaluate the obliteration with a cutoff AVM nidus volume of 3 cm(3) and 10 cm(3). RESULTS: One hundred sixty-two patients qualified for the study. The median patient age was 26 years and 48.8% were female. Hemorrhage presented as the most common symptom (48.1%). The median preembolization volume of an AVM was 14.3 cm(3). The median volume and margin dose for GKS were 10.92 cm(3) and 16.0 Gy, respectively. The median radiological and clinical follow-up intervals were 47 and 79 months, respectively. The annual hemorrhage rate was 1.71% and total obliteration rate was 56.8%. Noneloquent area (p = 0.004), superficial location (p < 0.001), decreased volume (p < 0.001), lower Spetzler-Martin grade (p < 0.001), lower Virginia Radiosurgery AVM Scale (RAS; p < 0.001), lower Pollock-Flickinger score (p < 0.001), lower modified Pollock-Flickinger score (p < 0.001), increased maximum dose (p < 0.001), and increased margin dose (p < 0.001) were found to be statistically significant in predicting the probability of AVM obliteration in the univariate analysis. In the multivariate analysis, only volume (p = 0.016) was found to be an independent prognostic factor for AVM obliteration. The log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test of the Kaplan-Meier analysis (chi-square = 54.402, p < 0.001) showed a significantly decreased obliteration rate of different cutoff AVM volume groups of less than 3 cm(3), 3-10 cm(3), and more than 10 cm(3). No independent prognostic factor was found for AVM hemorrhage in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Partially embolized AVMs are amenable to successful treatment with GKS. The volume of the nidus significantly influences the outcome of radiosurgical treatment.

12823868,Multimodality treatment of giant intracranial arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVE: Giant arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) (i.e., those greater than 6 cm at maximum diameter) are difficult to treat and often carry higher treatment morbidity and mortality rates than do smaller AVMs. In this study, we reviewed the treatment, angiographic results, and clinical outcomes in 53 patients with giant AVMs who were treated at Stanford between 1987 and 2001. METHODS: The patients selected included 20 males (38%) and 33 females (62%). Their presenting symptoms were hemorrhage (n = 20; 38%), seizures (n = 18; 34%), headaches (n = 8; 15%), and progressive neurological deficits (n = 7; 13%). One patient was in Spetzler-Martin Grade III, 9 were in Spetzler-Martin Grade IV, and 43 were in Spetzler-Martin Grade V. The mean AVM size was 6.8 cm (range, 6-15 cm). AVM venous drainage was superficial (n = 7), deep (n = 20), or both (n = 26). At presentation, 31 patients (58%) were graded in excellent neurological condition, 17 were graded good (32%), and 5 were graded poor (9%). RESULTS: The patients were treated with surgery (n = 27; 51%), embolization (n = 52; 98%), and/or radiosurgery (n = 47; 89%). Most patients received multimodality treatment with embolization followed by surgery (n = 5), embolization followed by radiosurgery (n = 23), or embolization, radiosurgery, and surgery (n = 23). Nineteen patients (36%) were completely cured of their giant AVMs, 90% obliteration was achieved in 4 patients (8%), less than 90% obliteration was achieved in 29 patients (55%) who had residual AVMs even after multimodality therapy, and 1 patient was lost to follow-up. Of the 33 patients who either completed treatment or were alive more than 3 years after undergoing their most recent radiosurgery, 19 patients (58%) were cured of their AVMs. The long-term treatment-related morbidity rate was 15%. The clinical results after mean follow-up of 37 months were 27 excellent (51%), 15 good (28%), 3 poor (6%), and 8 dead (15%). CONCLUSION: The results in this series of patients with giant AVMs, which represents the largest series reported to date, suggest that selected symptomatic patients with giant AVMs can be treated successfully with good outcomes and acceptable risk.

10766883,Results of radiosurgery for brain stem arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the treatment results of radiosurgery for brain stem arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and to seek optimal dose and treatment volume prescription for these lesions. METHODS: The clinical and radiological data of 30 consecutive patients with brain stem AVM treated with gamma knife radiosurgery were retrospectively reviewed with a mean follow up period of 52.2 months. There were 26 patients with previous haemorrhages and 21 with neurological deficit. Seventeen AVMs were located in the midbrain, 11 in the pons, and two in the medulla oblongata. All of the lesions were small with the intra-axial component occupying less than one third of the area of brain stem parenchyma on axial section of multiplanar MRI or CT. The mean diameter of the nidus was 1.26 cm, and the nidus volume within the brain stem parenchyma ranged from 0.1 to 2.0 cm(3). The mean radiation dose to the AVM margin was 18.4 Gy. RESULTS: The actuarial 3 year obliteration rate was 52.2%; 69.4% in cases treated with standard doses (minimum target dose, 18-20Gy), and 14.3% in cases treated with low doses (<18 Gy) (p<0.05). Two patients sustained symptomatic radiation injury, but there was no permanent neurological deficit caused by radiosurgery. Five patients had haemorrhage from the AVM after irradiation, including four fatal cases, resulting in a 4.0% annual rate of post-treatment bleeding.

24904052,Value of 4D MR angiography at 3T compared with DSA for the follow-up of treated brain arteriovenous malformation.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Four-dimensional, contrast-enhanced MRA is a useful technique for the diagnosis and classification of brain AVM. The purpose of this study was to evaluate its usefulness in the follow-up of treated brain AVM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with treated brain AVM (embolization, radiosurgery, and/or surgery) were investigated with both DSA (the ""gold standard"") and 4D MRA. Four-dimensional MRA was performed at 3T using a 4D sequence, combining contrast-enhanced timing-robust angiography, keyhole, and sensitivity encoding techniques. Examinations were evaluated by 2 independent readers and disagreements were resolved by a third reader. Interobserver and intermodality agreement with respect to residual nidus, residual venous drainage, and brain AVM patency were determined. RESULTS: Between May 2008 and February 2013, 37 patients with a median age of 45 years (interquartile range = 26-55) were prospectively included. Examinations were acquired 36 months (IQR = 10-45.5) after the last treatment. Interobserver agreement for brain AVM patency was very good for both 4D MRA (κ 0.82, 95% CI .67-.98) and DSA (κ 0.84, 95% CI .69-.98). After consensus reading, intermodality agreement for the evaluation of brain AVM patency was good (κ 0.73, 95% CI .55-.90). Diagnostic accuracy of 4D MRA for residual brain AVM compared with DSA, reached a sensitivity of 73.7%, specificity 100%, positive predictive value 100%, and negative predictive value 78.3%. Agreements by technique of treatment are also detailed. CONCLUSIONS: Four-dimensional MRA is a useful radiation-free technique for the follow-up of patients with treated brain AVM, especially patients treated by radiosurgery. However, given its actual limitations it is not sufficient to assert the cure; DSA remains mandatory for this purpose.",2014 Oct,2014,AJNR.

32434013,De Novo Development of Moyamoya Disease after Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Brain Arteriovenous Malformation in a Patient With RNF213 p.Arg4810Lys (rs112735431).,"BACKGROUND: Reports of cases diagnosed as Moyamoya disease (MMD) after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for arteriovenous malformation (AVM) are extremely rare. In recent years, ring finger protein 213 (RNF213) has been identified as a susceptibility gene of MMD, but the mechanism by which MMD develops remains unclear. Those cases of de novo development of MMD may provide some clues to clarify the mechanism of progression of MMD. CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of de novo MMD that developed after SRS for AVM. This patient presented with a variant of the RNF213 gene. The intracranial internal carotid artery was not within the irradiation field; therefore it was obvious that the development of MMD was not caused by the direct effect of radiation in the current case study. Moreover, we demonstrated the decrease in velocity in the internal carotid artery prior to the development of MMD using phase-contrast magnetic resonance angiography. Previous studies demonstrated that progression of the pathological condition in the cerebral arteries in response to hemodynamic changes is enhanced in patients with RNF213 variants. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the changes in the intracranial hemodynamics after SRS for AVM could trigger the de novo onset of MMD in patients with a genetic predisposition for the RNF213 variant.",2020 Aug,2020,World neurosurgery,140,,276-282,eng,False,S1878-8750(20)31039-1;10.1016/j.wneu.2020.05.068;S1878-8750(20)31039-1;10.1016/j.wneu.2020.05.068,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Adenosine Triphosphatases/*genetics;Adult;Angiography, Digital Subtraction;Female;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Moyamoya Disease/diagnostic imaging/*etiology/genetics;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects;Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*genetics",Arteriovenous malformation;Moyamoya disease;RNF213;Stereotactic radiosurgery
11240246,Risk for hemorrhage during the 2-year latency period following gamma knife radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations.,"PURPOSE: Radiosurgery does not immediately obliterate an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), and the risk for hemorrhage still persists until the AVM is occluded. There is controversy about whether this risk is altered after as compared to before radiosurgery. The aim of this paper is to study this topic further and to suggest a model to predict the risk for posttreatment hemorrhage. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The incidence of hemorrhages within the first 24 months following Gamma Knife radiosurgery was studied retrospectively among 1593 AVM patients, and was related to patient, AVM, and treatment parameters. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients experienced a hemorrhage in the latency period, representing an average annual incidence of 1.8%. The incidence of posttreatment hemorrhage was related to the patient's age, AVM volume, minimum dose, and average dose delivered to the AVM nidus. Based on these observations, an equation was defined that could quantify the probability for a posttreatment hemorrhage to occur. CONCLUSION: A model that can predict the probability for a hemorrhage within the first 24 months after radiosurgery is presented. The risk is higher for larger AVMs and for older patients, and it is lower when higher doses of radiation are used.",2001 Mar 15,2001,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",49,4,1045-51,eng,False,S0360-3016(00)01432-2;10.1016/s0360-3016(00)01432-2,Journal Article,Adult;Age Factors;*Algorithms;Female;Humans;Incidence;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/*surgery;Intracranial Hemorrhages/*epidemiology;Male;*Radiosurgery;Radiotherapy Dosage;Retrospective Studies;Risk Assessment;Time Factors,
34287695,Elective intervention for unruptured cranial arteriovenous malformations in relation to ARUBA trial: a National Inpatient Sample study.,"BACKGROUND: In 2014, A Randomized Trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformations (ARUBA) concluded that medical management alone for cranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) had better clinical outcomes than interventional treatment. The impact of the ARUBA study on changes in the rates of intervention and outcomes is unknown. Thus, we investigated whether the conclusions from ARUBA may have influenced treatment modalities and outcomes of unruptured AVMs. METHODS: The National Inpatient Sample (NIS) was queried between 2006 and 2018, for adult patients with an AVM who were admitted on an elective basis. Interventions included open, endovascular, and stereotactic surgeries. Join-point regression was used to assess differences in slopes of treatment rate for each modality before and after the time-point. Logistic regression was used to assess the odds of non-routine discharge and hemorrhage between the two time-points for each treatment modality. Linear regression was used to assess the mean length of stay (LOS) for each treatment modality between the two time-points. RESULTS: A total of 40,285 elective admissions for AVMs were identified between 2006 and 2018. The rate of intervention was higher pre-ARUBA (n = 15,848; 63.8%) compared to post-ARUBA (n = 6985; 45.2%; difference in slope - 8.24%, p < 0.001). The rate of open surgery decreased, while endovascular and stereotactic surgeries remained the same, after the ARUBA trial time-point (difference in slopes - 8.24%, p < 0.001; - 1.74%, p = 0.055; 0.20%, p = 0.22, respectively). For admissions involving interventions, the odds of non-routine discharge were higher post-ARUBA (OR 1.24; p = 0.043); the odds of hemorrhage were lower post-ARUBA (OR 0.69; p = 0.025). There was no statistical difference in length of stay between the two time-points (p = 0.22). CONCLUSION: The rate of intervention decreased, the rate of non-routine discharge increased, and rate of hemorrhage decreased post-ARUBA, suggesting that it may have influenced treatment practices for unruptured AVMs.",2021 Sep,2021,Acta neurochirurgica,163,9,2489-2495,eng,False,10.1007/s00701-021-04936-7;10.1007/s00701-021-04936-7;10.1007/s00701-021-04936-7,Journal Article;Randomized Controlled Trial,Adult;*Arteriovenous Fistula/epidemiology/surgery;Humans;Inpatients;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/epidemiology/surgery;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome,ARUBA trial;Arteriovenous malformations;Endovascular;Open surgery;Trends
21704930,Cerebral arteriovenous malformations: issues of the interplay between stereotactic radiosurgery and endovascular surgical therapy.,"Intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are congenital lesions frequently diagnosed as a result of hemorrhage or other neurological symptoms. Prevention of such devastating neurological injury has promoted a variety of treatment strategies. The rich history of multimodal therapy in the treatment of AVMs includes microsurgery, endovascular embolization, and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). This article reviews the biology and natural history of AVMs, as well as their treatment with both SRS and endovascular neurosurgery. It considers various paradigms and goals of endovascular treatment, along with relevant issues such as the features of an AVM to be targeted. Issues of the interplay between SRS and endovascular neurosurgery include the compartments of an embolized AVM to contain within the radiosurgery plan, the radioprotective and radiosensitizing effects of the embolic agent, the durability of embolization, and the sequencing of embolization with respect to the radiosurgical treatment.

38354649,Coexistence of moyamoya syndrome with arteriovenous malformation. Systematic review and illustrative case report.,"The coexistence of Moyamoya Syndrome with Arteriovenous Malformation is exceedingly rare. Here, we present the case of a 37-year-old female patient diagnosed with AVM in the right parietal lobe, accompanied by severe stenosis of the right middle cerebral artery and right anterior cerebral artery, along with moyamoya collateral induction. Our objective was to investigate the frequency and mutual influence of these conditions, and to determine a preferable treatment strategy by conducting a comprehensive review of previous case reports. We conducted a thorough search of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, adhering to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Our review encompassed 36 publications, reporting a total of 64 cases of AVM coexisting with Moyamoya Syndrome. Notably, bilateral stenosis was observed in half of the cases. Among patients with unilateral stenosis, AVM was localized in the opposite hemisphere only in 2 cases. Treatment approaches varied, with 18 cases undergoing active treatment for both stenosis and AVM, 11 cases treating stenosis prior to AVM, 5 cases addressing AVM first, and 3 cases treating both AVM and stenosis simultaneously. Embolization, either standalone or supplemented by stereotactic radiosurgery, was employed in six cases. Stereotactic radiosurgery alone was utilized in 12 cases, while 15 patients underwent surgical removal of the AVM. Our findings provide valuable insights for neurosurgeons managing patients with concurrent AVM and Moyamoya Syndrome. The variety of treatment approaches observed in the literature underscores the complexity of these cases, emphasizing the need for individualized strategies.

24941898,Linear accelerator stereotactic radiosurgery in the management of intracranial arteriovenous malformations: long-term outcome.,"BACKGROUND: Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is one of the cerebrovascular diseases that bear a high risk of hemorrhage. The treatment modalities include microsurgical resection, endovascular embolization, stereotactic radiosurgery, or combinations that vary widely. Several large series have been reported, while data from Asian populations were few. The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of linear accelerator stereotactic radiosurgery (LINAC SRS) for the treatment of intracranial AVMs, to evaluate the hemorrhage rate and to analyze associated factors. METHODS: One hundred and sixteen patients with AVM were treated with LINAC SRS in a single institute between September 1994 and May 2005 and were retrospectively evaluated. The demographics of patients, clinical characteristics of AVM, the treatment modalities, and the parameters of the LINAC SRS were analyzed. Delayed toxicity and hemorrhage rate after treatment were also evaluated. The AVM obliteration and bleed rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analyses. RESULTS: The efficacy rate with total obliteration after treatment was 81.9% (95 of 116 patients). The median interval to achieve total obliteration was 49 months. Microsurgical resection combined with SRS for residual AVMs achieved better obliteration rates compared to SRS alone (statistically significant, p = 0.001), while no significant difference was found between the embolization group and the group with no prior treatment (p = 0.895). The Spetzler-Martin grade of AVM is a relative factor of obliteration, higher grades resulting in a worse outcome (p = 0.009). Obliteration was significantly influenced by AVM volume in univariate analysis (p = 0.034), and volume <5 cm(3) contributed to improved obliteration (p = 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference in the hemorrhagic rate and the complication rate between ruptured and unruptured AVMs, while the unruptured group had a higher obliteration rate (p = 0.024). The annual hemorrhage rate after LINAC SRS treatment was 1.9%. The bleeding rate was 3.3% in the first year after radiosurgery, 2.1% in the second year, 1.9% between the second and fifth year, and 1.5% between the fifth and tenth year. Patients with hemorrhagic events before radiosurgery appeared to have a higher rebleeding risk during the latency period. Twenty-three patients (19.8%) had late adverse effects with regard to posttreatment radiological follow-up, but only 1 (0.8%) had newly developed neurological deficits. CONCLUSION: LINAC SRS achieved a high obliteration rate and reduced the risk of hemorrhage effectively in ruptured and unruptured intracranial AVMs. Prior microsurgical resection provided better outcome, while embolization showed no benefit.

16370428,Concomitant GRID boost for Gamma Knife radiosurgery.,"We developed an integrated GRID boost technique for Gamma Knife radiosurgery. The technique generates an array of high dose spots within the target volume via a grid of 4-mm shots. These high dose areas were placed over a conventional Gamma Knife plan where a peripheral dose covers the full target volume. The beam weights of the 4-mm shots were optimized iteratively to maximize the integral dose inside the target volume. To investigate the target volume coverage and the dose to the adjacent normal brain tissue for the technique, we compared the GRID boosted treatment plans with conventional Gamma Knife treatment plans using physical and biological indices such as dose-volume histogram (DVH), DVH-derived indices, equivalent uniform dose (EUD), tumor control probabilities (TCP), and normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCP). We found significant increase in the target volume indices such as mean dose (5%-34%; average 14%), TCP (4%-45%; average 21%), and EUD (2%-22%; average 11%) for the GRID boost technique. No significant change in the peripheral dose coverage for the target volume was found per RTOG protocol. In addition, the EUD and the NTCP for the normal brain adjacent to the target (i.e., the near region) were decreased for the GRID boost technique. In conclusion, we demonstrated a new technique for Gamma Knife radiosurgery that can escalate the dose to the target while sparing the adjacent normal brain tissue.",2005 Nov,2005,Medical physics,32,11,3419-23,eng,False,10.1118/1.2068887,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Algorithms;Brain/pathology/*surgery;Brain Neoplasms/surgery;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Models, Statistical;Phantoms, Imaging;Photons;Radiometry/*methods;Radiosurgery/*methods;Radiotherapy Dosage;Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted/*methods;Radiotherapy, Computer-Assisted;Software",
26325212,SLAM: Stereotactic Radiosurgery of Large Arteriovenous Malformations: Meta-analysis of Hemorrhage in High-Grade Pollock-Flickinger Arteriovenous Malformations.,"BACKGROUND: The prognosis of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) after treatment has been predicted largely by 2 grading scales: the Spetzler-Martin and Pollock-Flickinger. Although there are studies that examine the rate of hemorrhage with the Spetzler-Martin scale, there have not been studies examining hemorrhage in which the Pollock-Flickinger score was used. The annual hemorrhage rate after radiosurgery of Pollock-Flickinger AVM scores >2 is analyzed. METHODS: Literature search for radiosurgery of large AVMs from January 1, 2000 to June 1, 2014 was conducted. Articles were examined for individual patient data and aggregate patient data that reported hemorrhage rates and mortality. Patients were only included if they had an AVM score ≥2. RESULTS: Annual AVM hemorrhage rate after radiosurgery for all patients (n = 673) was 3.22% (99.3 hemorrhages, 3080.5 follow-up years, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 2.64%-3.89%). Mortality rate from hemorrhage was 40.08% (95% CI 31.21%-49.90%). A total of 203 patients presented with hemorrhage and 395 did not. In patients with first-time hemorrhage, the annual hemorrhage rate was 3.53% (95% CI 2.66%-4.77%). The annual hemorrhage rate of those with hemorrhagic presentation was 6.10% (95% CI 4.65%-8.07%). The odds ratio comparing re-hemorrhage rate versus first-time hemorrhage is 1.768 (95% CI 1.1571-2.7014, P = 0.0084). Complete obliteration of all AVMs was equal to 33.27% (95% CI, 29.25%-37.54%). CONCLUSIONS: The annual hemorrhage rate in AVMs with scores >2 treated with radiosurgery was comparable with baseline rupture rates reported for untreated AVMs. With further stratification by hemorrhagic versus nonhemorrhagic presentation, the subsequent annual hemorrhage rates are similar to their respective natural histories. Considering the mortality rate from hemorrhage at 40.08% (95% CI, 35.54%-44.62%), the consequences of radiosurgical treatment of large AVMs is significantly worse than the reported 10%-30% fatality rate from hemorrhage of an untreated AVM. Additionally, the overall mortality rate was 6.24% however the percentage of mortalities from hemorrhage was 97.62%.",2016 Jan,2016,World neurosurgery,85,,32-41,eng,False,S1878-8750(15)01037-2;10.1016/j.wneu.2015.08.022;S1878-8750(15)01037-2;10.1016/j.wneu.2015.08.022,Journal Article,Cross-Sectional Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/classification/*surgery;Intracranial Hemorrhages/classification/epidemiology/*etiology;Postoperative Complications/classification/epidemiology/*etiology;Prognosis;*Radiosurgery,AVM hemorrhage rate;Large AVM;Pollock-Flickinger;Radiosurgery

DISCUSSION: Case 1 involved a small craniotomy for decompression of a large cerebral multiloculated cyst, which had become symptomatic 84 months following gamma knife treatment for a left frontal lobe AVM. Case 2 involved surgical excision of an occipital radionecrotic mass 72 months following GK treatment for an occipital AVM. This patient had suffered from longstanding symptomatic cerebral oedema, which on occasions had become life threatening. Case 2 is also the first report of a radionecrotic mass occurring post-SRS for an AVM, which conversely appeared to demonstrate increased uptake on single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan. The first literature review of such delayed symptomatic radionecrotic lesions is presented. There appears to be a late onset of symptoms (average 55 months, range 12-111 months) associated with such radionecrosis. Drainage of such cysts or excision of the mass lesion appears to be consistently beneficial to the patients and appears to be uncomplicated. CONCLUSION: We recommend early surgical intervention for such delayed symptomatic radionecrotic masses that do not resolve following non-operative management. We also recommend caution in interpretation of SPECT scan results when attempting to differentiate radionecrosis from neoplasia.",2010 May,2010,Acta neurochirurgica,152,5,803-15,eng,False,10.1007/s00701-009-0581-1;10.1007/s00701-009-0581-1,Case Reports;Journal Article;Review,"Adult;Brain/diagnostic imaging/pathology/*surgery;Central Nervous System Cysts/etiology/pathology/surgery;Craniotomy/methods;Decompression, Surgical/methods;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/pathology/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Necrosis/pathology/physiopathology/*surgery;Neurosurgical Procedures/methods;Postoperative Complications/pathology/physiopathology/surgery;Radiation Injuries/pathology/physiopathology/*surgery;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects/methods;Reoperation;Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon;Tomography, X-Ray Computed;Treatment Outcome",

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate targeted embolization of aneurysms against other means of treatment with a case-control analysis; we previously investigated this approach associated with BAVMs. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients with BAVMs was performed, identifying patients treated with intention to occlude only an aneurysm associated with a BAVM. For each targeted aneurysm embolization (TAE) patient identified, 4 control patients were randomly selected, controlling for rupture status, age, and Spetzler-Martin plus Lawton-Young supplemental score. Analysis was performed to compare rates of adverse events (hemorrhage, new seizure, and death) between the 2 groups. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients met inclusion criteria, and 128 control patients were identified, out of 1103 patients treated during the study period. Thirty-four adverse events occurred (15 ruptures, 15 new seizures, and 11 deaths) during the follow-up period (mean 1157 d for the TAE cohort and 1036 d for the non-TAE cohort). Statistically lower associations were noted for the TAE group for any adverse event (hazard ratio 0.28, P = .037) and the composite outcome of hemorrhage or new seizure (hazard ratio 0.20, P = .029). CONCLUSION: For BAVMs at high risk for surgical resection, TAE can be performed safely and effectively. Patients treated with TAE had better outcomes than matched patients undergoing other combinations of treatment. TAE can be considered for BAVMs with high operative risk prior to radiosurgery or when no other treatment options are available.",2018 Mar 1,2018,Neurosurgery,82,3,343-349,eng,False,10.1093/neuros/nyx167;3610993;nyx167;10.1093/neuros/nyx167,Journal Article;Multicenter Study,"Adult;Aged;Case-Control Studies;Cohort Studies;Embolization, Therapeutic/*methods;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Aneurysm/diagnosis/epidemiology/*therapy;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/epidemiology/*therapy;Male;Middle Aged;Postoperative Complications/epidemiology/prevention & control;Radiosurgery/*methods;Random Allocation;Retrospective Studies;Risk Factors",
23473886,Cortical reorganization of motor functional areas in cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM) are congenital malformations that may grow in functional areas such as the primary motor cortex, but do not lead to motor deficits unless they rupture. We attempted to determine whether cortical reorganization was present in patients with AVM. We identified 22 patients with AVM who undergone had motor functional MRI (fMRI) evaluation. Patients were categorized according to AVM location: Group 1-away from motor areas (13 patients, 59.1%); Group 2-adjacent to motor areas (3 patients, 13.6%); and Group 3-overlying motor areas (6 patients, 27.3%). Groups 2 and 3 were compared to Group 1. In Group 3, six of six patients demonstrated cortical reorganisation (p=0.00037), and the four who underwent AVM removal did not sustain new neurological deficits. In Groups 1 and 2 no patient showed cortical reorganisation. Evidence of cortical reorganisation in patients with AVM overlying eloquent areas suggests that resection of these AVM may be possible with acceptable neurological deficits.",2013 May,2013,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society,20,5,649-53,eng,False,S0967-5868(12)00503-6;10.1016/j.jocn.2012.07.007;S0967-5868(12)00503-6;10.1016/j.jocn.2012.07.007,Comparative Study;Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Brain Mapping;Child;Follow-Up Studies;Functional Laterality/physiology;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/*physiopathology/surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging/instrumentation/methods;Motor Cortex/blood supply/*physiopathology;Neuronal Plasticity/physiology;Neuropsychological Tests;Radiosurgery/methods;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult,
31300533,Curative treatment for low-grade arteriovenous malformations.,"BACKGROUND: Spetzler-Martin (SM) grade I-II (low-grade) arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are often considered safe for microsurgery or radiosurgery. The adjunctive use of preoperative embolization to reduce surgical risk in these AVMs remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety of combined treatment of grade I-II AVMs with preoperative embolization followed by surgical resection or radiosurgery, and determine the long-term functional outcomes. METHODS: With institutional review board approval, a retrospective analysis was carried out on patients with ruptured and unruptured SM I-II AVMs between 2002 and 2017. Details of the endovascular procedures, including number of arteries supplying the AVM, number of branches embolized, embolic agent(s) used, and complications were studied. Baseline clinical and imaging characteristics were compared. Functional status using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) before and after endovascular and microsurgical treatments was compared. RESULTS: 258 SM I-II AVMs (36% SM I, 64% SM II) were identified in patients with a mean age of 38 ± 17 years. 48% presented with hemorrhage, 21% with seizure, 16% with headache, 10% with no symptoms, and 5% with clinical deficits. 90 patients (68%) in the unruptured group and 74 patients (59%) in the ruptured group underwent presurgical embolization (p = 0.0013). The mean number of arteries supplying the AVM was 1.44 and 1.41 in the unruptured and ruptured groups, respectively (p = 0.75). The mean number of arteries embolized was 2.51 in the unruptured group and 1.82 in the ruptured group (p = 0.003). n-Butyl cyanoacrylate and Onyx were the two most commonly used embolic agents. Four complications were seen in four patients (4/164 patients embolized): two peri-/postprocedural hemorrhage, one dissection, and one infarct. All patients undergoing surgery had a complete cure on postoperative angiography. Patients were followed up for a mean of 55 months. Good long-term outcomes (mRS score ≤ 2) were seen in 92.5% of patients with unruptured AVMs and 88.0% of those with ruptured AVMs. Permanent neurological morbidity occurred in 1.2%. CONCLUSIONS: Curative treatment of SM I-II AVMs can be performed using endovascular embolization with microsurgical resection or radiosurgery in selected cases, with very low morbidity and high cure rates. Compared with other published series, these outcomes suggest that preoperative embolization is a safe and effective adjunct to definitive surgical treatment. Long-term follow-up showed that patients with low-grade AVMs undergoing surgical resection or radiosurgery have good functional outcomes.",2020 Jan,2020,Journal of neurointerventional surgery,12,1,48-54,eng,True,10.1136/neurintsurg-2019-015115;neurintsurg-2019-015115;10.1136/neurintsurg-2019-015115,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Arteriovenous Fistula/*diagnostic imaging/*therapy;Child;Combined Modality Therapy/methods;Embolization, Therapeutic/methods;Endovascular Procedures/methods;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnostic imaging/*therapy;Male;Microsurgery/methods;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/methods;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",angiography;arteriovenous malformation;embolic;hemorrhage;liquid embolic material
28949989,In vivo imaging of endothelial cell adhesion molecule expression after radiosurgery in an animal model of arteriovenous malformation.,"Focussed radiosurgery may provide a means of inducing molecular changes on the luminal surface of diseased endothelium to allow targeted delivery of novel therapeutic compounds. We investigated the potential of ionizing radiation to induce surface expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) on endothelial cells (EC) in vitro and in vivo, to assess their suitability as vascular targets in irradiated arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Cultured brain microvascular EC were irradiated by linear accelerator at single doses of 0, 5, 15 or 25 Gy and expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 measured by qRT-PCR, Western, ELISA and immunocytochemistry. In vivo, near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence optical imaging using Xenolight 750-conjugated ICAM-1 or VCAM-1 antibodies examined luminal biodistribution over 84 days in a rat AVM model after Gamma Knife surgery at a single 15 Gy dose. ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were minimally expressed on untreated EC in vitro. Doses of 15 and 25 Gy stimulated expression equally; 5 Gy was not different from the unirradiated. In vivo, normal vessels did not bind or retain the fluorescent probes, however binding was significant in AVM vessels. No additive increases in probe binding were found in response to radiosurgery at a dose of 15 Gy. In summary, radiation induces adhesion molecule expression in vitro but elevated baseline levels in AVM vessels precludes further induction in vivo. These molecules may be suitable targets in irradiated vessels without hemodynamic derangement, but not AVMs. These findings demonstrate the importance of using flow-modulated, pre-clinical animal models for validating candidate proteins for vascular targeting in irradiated AVMs.",2017,2017,PloS one,12,9,e0185393,eng,False,10.1371/journal.pone.0185393;e0185393;PONE-D-17-16782;10.1371/journal.pone.0185393,Journal Article,"Animals;*Disease Models, Animal;Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/metabolism;Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/*metabolism;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*metabolism/*surgery;Male;Mice;Radiosurgery/*methods;Radiotherapy Dosage;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/*metabolism",
23128895,Retrospective analysis of linac-based radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations and testing of the Flickinger formula in predicting radiation injury.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to validate the use of linac-based radiosurgery in arteriovenous malformation (AVM) patients and to predict complications using an integrated logistic formula (ILF) in comparison with clinical outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The results of radiosurgery in 92 AVM patients were examined. All patients were treated with linac-based radiosurgery. Of these, 70 patients were followed for 12-45 months (median, 24 months) and were analyzed. The treated volume varied from 0.09 to 26.95 cm(³) (median, 2.3 cm(³)) and the median marginal dose was 20 Gy (range, 10.4-22). The median 12-Gy volume was 9.94 cm(³) (range, 0.74-60.09 cm(³)). Patients and lesion characteristics potentially affecting nidus obliteration and excellent outcome were evaluated by performing a log-rank test and univariate and multivariate analyses. The risk for radiation injury (RRI) was calculated with an integrated logistic formula. The predictive power of the RRI was assessed by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS: Follow-up magnetic resonance (MR) angiography revealed complete AVM obliteration in 56 of 70 patients. The MR angiography confirmed an obliteration rate of 80%. The annual hemorrhage rate was 1.4% for the first 2 years after radiosurgery and 0% thereafter. The number of patients with an excellent outcome was 48 (68%). Factors associated with better obliteration were higher radiation dose to the lesion margins [12-Gy volume (V12) >10 cm(³)], small volume, and a Pollock-Flickinger score less than 1.49; those predicting excellent outcomes were V12<10 cm(³), small volume, and Pollock-Flickinger score less than 1.49, as determined by multivariate analyses. Factors associated with radiation injury were V12>10 cm(³ )(p=0.03) and volume greater than 2 cm(³) (p=0.001), as determined by a univariate analysis. The analyses showed an ROC of 0.66. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that linac-based radiosurgery is effective. In terms of obliteration, excellent outcomes, and especially radiation injury, V12 and volume should be considered. The Flickinger formula seems to be applicable to Novalis-treated patients, but long-term follow-up is necessary for definite conclusions.",2012 Dec,2012,Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ...

33812069,The Thalamic Arteriovenous Malformations Have Better Prognosis than Basal Ganglia Malformations Regarding Obliteration: Prognostic Factors Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are rare vascular congenital lesions that affect mainly patients during their productive years of life. In order to obtain a better quality of life for patients with this disease, a multidisciplinary approach is recommended. Radiosurgery is one of the treatment modalities available for AVMs, but many factors may influence the effectiveness of this strategy. Classically, it has been said that deep-seated lesions have a particular behavior compared with AVMs in other regions, but a differentiation between thalamic lesions and those located in the basal ganglia has not been made. METHODS: Institutional records for central core AVMs treated with radiosurgery between January 2004 and January 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. Brainstem lesions were excluded from the analysis. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients with deep-seated AVMs were included. Forty-three (87.8%) were located in the thalamus and 6 (12.2%) in the area of basal ganglia. The nidus mean volume was 4.1 cm(3) (SD: 4.1), the maximum diameter mean was of 19.5 mm (SD: 8.0). The prescription dose was 18.2 Gy (SD: 2.1), and the follow-up time was 75.8 months (SD: 32.5). There was a greater obliteration rate in thalamic AVMs compared with those located in the basal ganglia: 81.4% versus 33.3% (P = 0.026), respectively. There was no association between categorical variables and obliteration rate. CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic radiosurgery is a good option for patients with thalamic and basal ganglia AVMs, but a multidisciplinary approach to decision-making is mandatory in order to achieve the best results.",2021 Jun,2021,World neurosurgery,150,,e750-e755,eng,False,S1878-8750(21)00498-8;10.1016/j.wneu.2021.03.127;S1878-8750(21)00498-8;10.1016/j.wneu.2021.03.127,Journal Article,Adult;Arteriovenous Fistula/*pathology/*surgery;Basal Ganglia/*pathology/surgery;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*pathology/*surgery;Male;Prognosis;Radiosurgery/methods;Retrospective Studies;Thalamus/*pathology/surgery;Treatment Outcome,AVMs;Deep-seated;LINAC;Stereotactic radiosurgery

OBJECTIVE: To confirm or repudiate the ARUBA conclusion that ""medical management only is superior to medical management with interventional therapy for unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations."" METHODS: Data were collected from 1351 patients treated with Gamma Knife Surgery (GKS; Elekta AB, Stockholm, Sweden) for unruptured and untreated AVMs The follow-up was 8817 yr (median 5.0 and mean 6.5). The results of the analyses were compared to that found in patients randomized to medical management only in the ARUBA trial and extrapolated to a 10-yr time period. Our data were also compared to the natural course in a virtual AVM population for a 25-yr time period. RESULTS: The incidence of stroke was similar among ARUBA and our patients for the first 5 yr. Thereafter, the longer the follow-up, the relatively better outcome following treatment. Both the mortality rate and the incidence of permanent deficits in patients with small AVMs were the same as in untreated patients for the first 2 to 3 yr after GKS, after which GKS patients did better. Patients with large AVMs had a higher incidence of neurological deficits in the first 3 yr following GKS. The difference decreased thereafter, but the time until break even depended on the analysis method used and the assumed risk for hemorrhage in patent AVMs. CONCLUSION: The ARUBA trial conclusion that medical management is superior to medical management with interventional therapy for all unruptured AVMs could be repudiated.",2019 Jul 1,2019,Neurosurgery,85,1,E118-E124,eng,True,10.1093/neuros/nyy391;5123394;10.1093/neuros/nyy391,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Arteriovenous Fistula/complications/*therapy;Child;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Incidence;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/methods;Stroke/*epidemiology/*etiology;Sweden;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",Gamma Knife Surgery;Natural course;Unruptured brain AVM
25547253,Effect of prior hemorrhage on intracranial arteriovenous malformation radiosurgery outcomes.,"BACKGROUND: Intracerebral hemorrhage is simultaneously the most frequent and most debilitating manifestation of intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVM), but its impact on success and complications of radiosurgery has not been rigorously assessed. In this case-control study, we define the effect of prior hemorrhage on AVM radiosurgery outcomes. METHODS: From a prospective, institutional database of 1,400 AVM patients treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery, unruptured and ruptured AVMs were matched in a 1:1 fashion, blinded to outcome, based on patient demographics, prior embolization (26.6% of each cohort), AVM size (mean volume of unruptured AVMs 3.7 cm(3) versus ruptured AVMs 3.5 cm(3), p = 0.195), Spetzler-Martin grade (Grade I 17.0%, Grade II 37.8%, Grade III 34.8%, Grade IV 10.4% for each cohort), and radiosurgical treatment parameters (mean prescription dose for unruptured AVMs 20.9 Gy versus ruptured AVMs 21.0 Gy, p = 0.837). There were 270 patients in each cohort. Matched statistical analyses were used to compare the baseline characteristics, obliteration rates, post-radiosurgery latency period hemorrhage risks, and incidences of radiation-induced changes (RIC) between the two cohorts. RESULTS: The actuarial obliteration rates of the two cohorts were similar (unruptured AVMs: 38, 58, and 76% at 3, 5, 10 years, respectively; ruptured AVMs: 40, 60, and 73% at 3, 5, 10 years, respectively; p = 0.592). However, for embolized AVMs, complete obliteration was more likely to be achieved in unruptured lesions (unruptured AVMs: 25, 32, and 54% at 3, 5, 10 years, respectively; ruptured AVMs: 18, 27, and 42% at 3, 5, 10 years, respectively; p = 0.038). Prior AVM rupture resulted in a higher annual risk of post-radiosurgery latency period hemorrhage (ruptured AVMs 2.3% versus unruptured AVMs 1.1%, p = 0.025) but a lower rate of cumulative and symptomatic RIC (cumulative RIC: ruptured AVMs 30.4% versus unruptured AVMs 48.9%, p < 0.0001; symptomatic RIC: ruptured AVMs 7.0% versus unruptured AVMs 12.2%, p = 0.041, respectively). The rates of permanent RIC were similar between the unruptured (2.2%) and ruptured (1.9%) AVM cohorts (p = 0.761). The mean time interval to onset of RIC (unruptured AVMs 13.3 months versus ruptured AVMs 12.1 months, p = 0.783), and the mean duration of RIC (unruptured AVMs 22.0 months versus ruptured AVMs 21.7 months, p = 0.599) were not significantly different between the two cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Prior AVM rupture significantly alters the risk of latency period hemorrhage and RIC following radiosurgery. These effects should be taken into consideration with the multidisciplinary management of AVM patients.

30394359,A Retrospective Cohort Analysis of Hemorrhagic Arteriovenous Malformations Treated with Combined Endovascular Embolization and Gamma Knife Stereotactic Radiosurgery.,"BACKGROUND: The management of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) remains a controversial topic. Given the relatively low incidence, high heterogeneity, and high morbidity and mortality of these lesions, consensus on treatment strategies is an issue of concern to organized neurosurgery. The present retrospective analysis examined and quantified the outcomes of patients with an initial presentation of intracranial hemorrhage from a Spetzler-Martin grade III or IV AVM, later ruled out as surgical candidates. METHODS: A total of 16 patients (5 females; 11 males) had presented with symptomatic hemorrhage confirmed by non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography and were deemed to not be surgical candidates owing to AVM location and/or architecture. The patients underwent combined endovascular embolization and gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). The modified Rankin scale was used to measure the clinical outcomes, comparing the scores at presentation, gamma knife treatment, and the last known follow-up examination. A radiographic evaluation was used to determine the level of AVM nidus involution after the procedure. RESULTS: The present study identified 16 patients with ruptured high-grade AVMs of high surgical risk. All the patients had undergone immediate embolization with delayed SRS for treatment of the hemorrhage and nidus of the AVM. A statistically significant proportion of patients showed marked improvement in the modified Rankin scale scores. No subsequent repeat hemorrhage or any associated complications after embolization occurred in any patient.

23258506,The technical evolution of gamma knife radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations.,"Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery was first applied for the treatment of an intracranial arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in 1968. Using biplane angiography to target a small-volume, deep-seated lesion, photons were cross-fired on the pathological shunt. The AVM was obliterated within 3 years. This began a cautious introduction of Gamma Knife radiosurgery in the 1970s. As the Gamma Knife technology spread to sites in Europe, South America and the USA in the 1980s, AVM radiosurgery became a primary indication. During the early years the usual standard was to deliver a single radiosurgical isocenter to the target defined by 2-dimensional angiography. Most patients had small-volume AVMs unsuitable for surgical excision. Over time the technique of Gamma Knife AVM surgery evolved to include: careful patient selection, discussion of appropriate treatment strategies, anticonvulsant administration for lobar locations and intraoperative targeting using both high-resolution axial plane imaging--usually magnetic resonance imaging--coupled with biplane digital subtraction angiography. High-speed computer dose planning integrated with more detailed imaging strategies facilitated conformal radiation delivery in a single treatment session coupled with high selectivity of the dose delivered. Multiple isocenters became routine. Long-term follow-up care included serial imaging evaluations to assess the response and to detect complications. Imaging was critical to confirm the desired radiobiological response--complete obliteration. Long-term follow-up after obliteration confirmed that AVM radiosurgery had a high success rate for properly selected patients and a risk-benefit profile that substantiated patient safety. Twenty-year results after Gamma Knife radiosurgery for AVMs are currently available. Established roles have been found for pediatric cases and for larger-volume AVMs unsuitable for surgical removal. The role and technique of embolization prior to radiosurgery continue to be evaluated. Current dose response data based on volume and predictions of adverse radiation effects guide current care.",2013,2013,Progress in neurological surgery,27,,22-34,eng,False,10.1159/000341625;000341625;10.1159/000341625,Journal Article;Review,Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/*surgery;Biomedical Technology/trends;Humans;Radiation Dosage;Radiosurgery/*instrumentation/methods/*trends;Treatment Outcome,

10942665,Selection of treatment modalities for cerebral arteriovenous malformations: a retrospective analysis of 348 consecutive cases.,"The objective was to establish the selection criteria for the optimal management modalities for cerebral arteriovenous malformations. We analysed the complications and late outcomes in 348 consecutive cases (132 microsurgical resections, 202 stereotactic radiosurgeries, 8 embolisations only, 6 combined treatments) managed at Yonsei University Hospital from 1988 to 1997. Files for all patients were analysed. The outcome was classified into good for the patients who returned to their previous job with or without neurological deficits, fair for the patients who were unable to return to work but performed daily activities independently with minor deficits, and poor for the patients who were performing dependent daily activities with major deficits. The outcome of microsurgery was considered good in 108 patients (81.8%), fair in 18 (13.6%), poor in 4 (3.1%), and 2 (1.5%) patients died. Initial insults and haemodynamic complications were the major cause of an unfavourable outcome. The cumulative occlusion rate of the nidus after radiosurgery was 10.2% within 12 months, 75.3% within 24 months, and 89.8% within 36 months. Perilesional imaging changes with neurological deficits (4 permanent and 6 transient, 4.8%) and haemorrhage (16 patients, 7.7%) during the latent interval were the major cause of an unfavourable outcome (1 poor, 4 dead after radiosurgery). Postradiosurgery bleeding occurred frequently within 6 months (6 patients), and between 13 and 24 months (8 patients). In conclusion, selection of treatment modality for cerebral AVMs depends on the preoperative evaluation of the risk/benefit ratio in each case. Microsurgical removal, which eliminates the risk of bleeding immediately, is preferred for lesions in non-eloquent areas. Radiosurgery is an effective treatment modality for small lesions in eloquent areas, but has a substantial risk of haemorrhage during the latency period. Results of this study suggest that microsurgical removal should be considered for lesions in eloquent areas with high haemorrhage risk, such as prior haemorrhage, medium to large size lesion, and single deep venous drainage.",2000 Sep,2000,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society,7,5,429-33,eng,False,S0967-5868(99)90698-7;10.1054/jocn.1999.0698,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/*surgery;Intracranial Hemorrhages/etiology/*surgery;Male;Microsurgery/*methods;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/*methods;Retrospective Studies;Risk Assessment/methods;Seizures/etiology/*surgery;Treatment Outcome",
39079685,Long-Term Outcome of Time-Staged Gamma Knife Radiosurgery for Large Arteriovenous Malformations.,"BACKGROUND: Treatment for large (> 10 mL) arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) remains highly challenging. This study evaluated long-term effect of time-staged gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS) for large AVMs. METHODS: For patients with large AVMs treated by time-staged GKS over 10 years, time-staged GKS was repeated every three years targeting the entire nidus if total obliteration was not achieved. Obliteration rate and post-GKS complications were assessed based on 10 mL volume interval of AVMs. Prognostic factors for these outcomes were evaluated using Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: Ninety-six patients were analyzed. For AVMs in the 10-20 mL subgroup, a dose ≥ 13.5Gy yielded higher obliteration rate in the first GKS. In the 20-30 mL subgroup, a second GKS significantly boosted obliteration. AVMs > 30 mL did not achieve any obliteration with the first GKS. Among 35 (36.4%) cases lost to follow-up, 7 (7.2%) were lost due to GKS complications. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that each subgroup needed different time for achieving 50% favorable obliteration outcome rate: 3.5, 6.5, and 8.2 years for 10-20 mL, 20-30 mL, and > 30 mL subgroup, respectively. Total obliteration rate calculated by intention-to-treat method: 73%, 51.7%, 35.7%, respectively, 61.5% overall. Post-GKS hemorrhage and chronic encapsulated expanding hematoma (CEEH) occurred in 13.5% and 8.3% of cases, respectively. Two patients died. Dose and volume were significant prognostic factors for obliteration. Initial AVM volume was a significant prognostic factor of post-GKS hemorrhage and CEEH. CONCLUSION: Time-staged GKS for large AVMs less than 30 mL has highly favorable long-term outcome and a tolerable complication rate.",2024 Jul 29,2024,Journal of Korean medical science,39,29,e217,eng,True,10.3346/jkms.2024.39.e217;e217;39.e217;10.3346/jkms.2024.39.e217,Journal Article,Humans;*Radiosurgery;Female;Male;Adult;Middle Aged;Treatment Outcome;*Kaplan-Meier Estimate;Adolescent;Young Adult;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery/radiotherapy;Retrospective Studies;Proportional Hazards Models;Child;Aged;Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery;Follow-Up Studies,Chronic Encapsulated Expanding Hematoma;Large Arteriovenous Malformation;Long-Term Outcome;Minimal Residual Shunt;Time-Staged Gamma Knife Radiosurgery
27838427,Effective Surgical Management of Competitive Venous Outflow Restriction After Radiosurgery for Cerebral AVMs: Report of 2 Cases.,"BACKGROUND: Intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are complex pathologies. For patients who do not present with hemorrhage, treatment strategies are often predicated on reducing the risk of hemorrhage and minimizing morbidity. Outcomes vary according to the efficacy of treatment selected. Radiosurgical treatment of certain AVMs can result in incomplete obliteration and may also have only a minimal effect on the presenting nonhemorrhagic symptoms. CASE DESCRIPTIONS: We present 2 cases of patients with AVMs who were initially treated with radiosurgery. Both patients' primary clinical symptoms were headaches, which persisted after radiosurgical treatment but abated after subsequent microsurgical resection with or without endovascular embolization. CONCLUSION: Venous outflow obstruction is likely a sizable contributive factor in occipital AVMs among patients who present with headaches and symptoms of intracranial hypertension. Because these high-flow lesions may be suboptimally responsive to stereotactic radiosurgery, microsurgical resection, with or without adjunctive endovascular embolization, should be considered as an initial and definitive treatment strategy. Optimal outcomes may be achieved in patients with a visual deficit that is anatomically correlated to their AVMs.",2017 Feb,2017,World neurosurgery,98,,882.e1-882.e7,eng,False,S1878-8750(16)31151-2;10.1016/j.wneu.2016.11.007;S1878-8750(16)31151-2;10.1016/j.wneu.2016.11.007,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Cerebral Angiography;Embolization, Therapeutic/*adverse effects;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery;Magnetic Resonance Angiography;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Microsurgery/methods;Middle Aged;Postoperative Complications/diagnostic imaging/*etiology/*surgery;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects;Ventricular Outflow Obstruction/diagnostic imaging/*etiology/*surgery",Arteriovenous malformation;Radiosurgery;Venous outflow
11396666,Stereotactic radiosurgery in New Zealand.,"AIMS: To explain the use of Stereotactic Radiosurgery for intracranial lesions and report Dunedin Hospital's early experience with this treatment. METHODS: Review of a prospective computer database and departmental clinical files. RESULTS: 74 patients underwent 78 radiosurgical procedures between 30 July 1994 to 18 December 1997. 28 patients with arteriovenous malformations were treated with an obliteration rate of 82% (95% CI: 48% to 98%) at two years. Seventeen vestibular schwannomas (acoustic neuroma's) were treated, with follow-up magnetic resonance imaging available in eleven in whom there was no tumour progression after a mean period of twelve months. There was preservation of some hearing in all patients not already deaf, but one developed a new facial palsy and another had worsening palsy as late side effects. Other tumours, including selected metastases, gliomas and skull base tumours have been treated in smaller numbers. CONCLUSION: Rates of arteriovenous malformation obliteration, vestibular schwannoma control, and side effects of radiosurgery in Dunedin are comparable to those reported in other uncontrolled series. Radiosurgery is quick and has a low procedure-related morbidity but does have important limitations and delayed side effects, which means the decision to treat needs to be based on thorough multidisciplinary review.",2001 Apr 27,2001,The New Zealand medical journal,114,1130,182-4,eng,False,,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Brain Neoplasms/*surgery;Child;Child, Preschool;Ear Neoplasms/*surgery;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Middle Aged;Neurilemmoma/surgery;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;*Stereotaxic Techniques;Vestibular Diseases/*surgery",

CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe a case of hemorrhage, 6 years after radiosurgery and 4 years after complete angiographic obliteration of an AVM that had not previously bled and that persisted angiographically, obliterated after bleeding. RESULTS: Several treatment options have been reported for patients with completely obliterated AVMs that bled, including conservative treatment, repeated radiosurgery, and open surgery with resection of AVM remnants. In the present case, the decision to perform surgery based on the probable association of the enhancing area observed on the MRI and the histologic findings was finally confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: Magnetic resonance imaging enhancement areas on the obliterated AVMs may have a histopathologic correlation with persistence of permeable vessels and can be used as a guide for surgery and postoperative control.

METHODS: The authors retrospectively analyzed their experience with gamma knife surgery in 400 patients with AVMs (follow-up period 1-135 months, median 65 months), with special reference to the imaging modality used in each case. The calculated obliteration rates varied from 68.2 to 92%, depending on imaging modality and timing of evaluation. When only unquestionable imaging data such as demonstrations of a residual nidus on computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) images or findings on angiograms were used in the calculation, the obliteration rates were 72% at 3 years and 87.3% at 5 years. Factors leading to a better obliteration rate were previous hemorrhage (p = 0.0084), smaller nidus (p = 0.0023), and higher radiation dose to the lesion's margin (p = 0.0495), as determined in a multivariate analysis. Factors leading to an earlier obliteration of the nidus were male sex (p = 0.0001), previous hemorrhage (p = 0.0039), smaller nidus diameter (p = 0.0006), and dose planning using angiography alone (p = 0.0201). CONCLUSIONS: After the introduction of CT and MR images into dose planning, the conformity and selectivity of dosimetry improved remarkably, although the latency intervals until obliteration were prolonged. Imaging outcomes for AVMs should be evaluated using data provided by longer follow-up periods. The timing of additional treatments for residual AVMs should be decided cautiously, considering the size of the AVM, the patient age and sex, and the history of hemorrhage before radiosurgery.",2004 Jul,2004,Journal of neurosurgery,101,1,18-24,eng,True,10.3171/jns.2004.101.1.0018,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/pathology/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Radiography;*Radiosurgery;Reoperation;Retrospective Studies;Time Factors;Tokyo;Treatment Outcome",
32689634,Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Brain Arteriovenous Malformations: Evaluation of Obliteration and Review of Associated Predictors.,"BACKGROUND: High arteriovenous malformation (AVM) obliteration rates have been reported with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), and multiple factors have been found to be associated with AVM obliteration. These predictors have been inconsistent throughout studies. We aimed to analyze our experience with linear accelerator (LINAC)-based SRS for brain AVMs, evaluate outcomes, assess factors associated with AVM obliteration and review the various reported predictors of AVM obliteration. METHODS: Electronic medical records were retrospectively reviewed to identify consecutive patients with brain AVMs treated with SRS over a 27-year period with at least 2 years of follow-up. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with AVM obliteration. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-eight patients with 142 brain AVMs treated with SRS were included. Mean age was 34.4 years. Fifty-two percent of AVMs were associated with a hemorrhage before SRS, and 14.8% were previously embolized. Mean clinical and angiographic follow-up times were 67.8 months and 58.6 months, respectively. The median Spetzler-Martin grade was 3. Mean maximal AVM diameter was 2.8 cm and mean AVM target volume was 7.4 cm(3) with a median radiation dose of 16 Gy. Complete AVM obliteration was achieved in 80.3%. Radiation-related signs and symptoms were encountered in 32.4%, only 4.9% of which consisted of a permanent deficit. Post-SRS AVM-related hemorrhage occurred in 6.3% of cases. In multivariate analysis, factors associated with AVM obliteration included younger patient age (P = .019), male gender (P = .008), smaller AVM diameter (P = .04), smaller AVM target volume (P = .009), smaller isodose surface volume (P = .005), a higher delivered radiation dose (P = .013), and having only one major draining vein (P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: AVM obliteration with LINAC-based radiosurgery was safe and effective and achieved complete AVM obliteration in about 80% of cases.

11596958,Population-based analysis of arteriovenous malformation treatment.,"OBJECT: The author sought to describe overall management data on cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and to focus the actuarial need for different treatment modalities on a population-based scale. Such data would seem important in the planning of regional or national multimodality strategies for the treatment of AVMs. This analysis of a nonselected, consecutive series of patients representing every diagnosed case of cerebral AVM in a population of 1,000,000 over one decade may serve to shed some light on these treatment aspects. METHODS: During the 11-year period from 1989 to 1999, data from every patient harboring a cerebral AVM that was presented clinically or discovered incidentally in a strictly defined population of 986,000 people were collected prospectively. No patient was lost to follow up. There were 12.4 de novo diagnosed AVMs per 1,000,000 population per year (135 AVMs). Large high-grade AVMs (Spetzler-Martin classification) were rare, and Grade 1 to 3 lesions represented 85% of the caseload. Hemorrhage was the initial manifestation of AVM in 69.6% of the cases. lntracerebral hematoma was the most common hemorrhagic manifestation occurring in 78 patients. There were 4.4 cases per 1,000,000 population per year of hematomas needing expedient surgical evacuation. In the remaining patients who did not require hematoma surgery, small, critically located Grade 3 and Grade 4 lesions amounted to 1.6 cases per 1,000,000 population per year. There were 5.8 cases per 1,000,000 population per year of Grade 1 to 2 and larger noncritically located Grade 3 malformations. There were 0.5 cases per 1,000,000 population per year of Grade 5 AVMs. The overall outcome in 135 patients was classified as good according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale (Score 5) in 61% of the cases, and the overall mortality rate was 9%. CONCLUSIONS: In centers with population-based referral, AVM of the brain is predominantly a disease related to intracranial bleeding. and parenchymal clots have a profound impact on overall management outcome. The rupture of an AVM is as devastating as that of an aneurysm. Aneurysm ruptures are more lethal, whereas AVM rupture tends to result in more neurological disability due to the high occurrence of lobar intracerebral hematoma. In an attempt to quantify the need for different modalities of AVM treatment based on a population of 1,000,000 people, figures for surgeries performed range from six to 10 operations per year and embolization as well as gamma knife surgery procedures range from two to seven per year, depending on the strategy at hand. When using nonsurgical approaches to Grade 1 to 3 lesions, the number of patients requiring treatment with more than one method for obliteration increases drastically as does the potential risk for procedure-related complications.",2001 Oct,2001,Journal of neurosurgery,95,4,633-7,eng,False,10.3171/jns.2001.95.4.0633,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Cerebral Hemorrhage/complications/etiology;Child;Embolization, Therapeutic;Female;Hematoma/etiology;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/classification/complications/*therapy;Male;Middle Aged;Nervous System Diseases/etiology;Neurosurgical Procedures;Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Rupture, Spontaneous",
19119041,[Radiosurgery of cerebral arteriovenous malformations: a prescription algorithm].,"PURPOSE: To study prognostic factors of obliteration and risk factors of brain radiation necrosis in order to propose an algorithm for radiosurgery prescription for cerebral arteriovenous malformations (cAVM). MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred and seventy-nine patients were analysed. Radiosurgery delivered 6 or 10 MV X-rays by arc therapy in 84% of cases, or by fixed field in 16% of cases using two different micro-multileaf collimators (micro-MLC). Follow-up consisted of screening radiation necrosis by MRI every 6 months, and assessing local control by arteriography every 2 years. Obliteration was defined as at least 95% reduction of cAVM volume. Cox proportional hazard model was used to evaluate the local control and the appearance of radiation necrosis over time. RESULTS: Local control rate was 82.7% with the mean follow-up of 3.1 years (0.5-11). Significant prognostic factors were: simple nidus (RR=2.8, p<0.0001), number of embolizations before radiosurgery below 4 (RR=2.9, p<0.0001), prescribed dose to the periphery of at least 18 Gy (RR=2, p=0.0002), nidus volume below8cm(3) (RR=1.9, p=0.0002), and number of table positions below six (RR=1.4, p=0.05). Radiation necrosis rate was 11.2% with a mean time to onset of 18 months. Significant predictive factors were: fixed field versus arc therapy (according to MLC RR=9.1, p<0.0001, and RR=15.1, p=0.01), age below 30 years (RR=2.5, p=0.04), depth of cAVM greater than or equal to 7 cm (RR=7.6, p=0.008), and volume of brain tissue covered by the 12 Gy isodose (V12 Gy) of at least 11 cm(3) (RR=7.8, p=0.05).

Preliminary results].,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Microsurgical resection have the advantage to be immediately effective according to bleeding risk and is the reference treatment for cerebral arteriovenous malformations. For cerebral arteriovenous malformations located in the brainstem gamma-knife radiosurgery due to its low invasivity is classically a first line treatment. We reviewed the Marseilles experience to assess the efficacy and safety of gamma-knife radiosurgery for brain stem arteriovenous malformations. METHODS: We analyzed retrospectively data of 45 patients with an arteriovenous malformation located in the brain stem treated in Marseilles by gamma-knife radiosurgery by between 07/92 and 12/99. Mean age was 42 years, there were 5 children. Arteriovenous malformations were located in the pons or midbrain for the majority of the patients. Intraaxial lesion was found in 82% of patients. Hemorrhage prior to radiosurgery occurred in 75% of the patients. Gamma-knife procedure was the first treatment of the arteriovenous malformations for 29 patients (65%); previous surgery was performed in 34 patients (15%). Mean nidus volume was 550 mm(3) (32-14 196 mm(3)). Mean margin dose was of 23 Gy (range 15-30 Gy). Follow up was available for 25 patients (mean 18 months). RESULTS: One patient presented a transient worsening of his neurological status, and 2 patients developed a fixed deficit. Two patients underwent rebleeding at an interval of 12 to 36 months after the gamma-knife procedure. At last angiographic follow-up (13 patients), the obliteration rate was 82% of the arteriovenous malformations. A second procedure was proposed to a patient with only partial occlusion at 3 years.

Patients are not protected against the risks leading to treatment. Two therapeutic options can be used to eradicate the persisting nidus: micro-surgery and a second irradiation. Our group has reirradiated 39 such patients. MATERIAL: From 1989 to 2000, 39 patients have been reirradiated (14 females and 25 males; median age 31 years). There were more left lesions: 59% than right (35%) and 5% on midline. The most frequent locations were: temporal 12 cases; parietal 8 cases; frontal 7 cases; thalamus 7 cases.

Treatment has been performed with the same system for the first and the second radiosurgery for 37 patients. Planification and dosimetry improved during that period. The level of dose was similar for the 2 RS. MRI has been used as a non invasive follow-up tool. RESULTS: Only 28 patients were evaluable because 7/39 patients had the second radiosurgery in 1999 or in 2000 and data were lacking at the time of writing for 4 patients. Obliteration rate was 17/28 (60.7%). Nine patients bled between the two radiosurgery procedures. COMPLICATIONS: 4 new regressive deficits occurred after the second radiosurgery. The rate of parenchymal changes were higher, after the second radiosurgery.

16385325,Prospective staged volume radiosurgery for large arteriovenous malformations: indications and outcomes in otherwise untreatable patients.,"OBJECTIVE: The obliteration response of an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) to radiosurgery is strongly dependent on dose and volume. For larger volumes, the dose must be reduced for safety, but this compromises obliteration. In 1992, we prospectively began to stage anatomic components in order to deliver higher single doses to symptomatic AVMs >15 ml in volume. METHODS: During a 17-year interval at the University of Pittsburgh, 1040 patients underwent radiosurgery for a brain AVM. Out of 135 patients who had multiple procedures, 37 patients underwent prospectively staged volume radiosurgery for symptomatic otherwise unmanageable larger malformations. Twenty-eight patients who were managed before 2002 were included in this study to achieve sufficient follow-up in assessing the outcomes. The median age was 37 years (range, 13-57 yr). Thirteen patients had previous hemorrhages and 13 patients had attempted embolization. Separate anatomic volumes were irradiated at 3 to 8 months (median, 5 mo) intervals. The median initial AVM volume was 24.9 ml (range, 10.2-57.7 ml). Twenty-six patients had two stages and two had three-stage radiosurgery. Seven patients had repeat radiosurgery after a median interval of 63 months. The median target volume was 12.3 ml. (range, 4.2-20.8 ml.) at Stage I and 11.5 ml. (range, 2.8-22 ml.) at Stage II. The median margin dose was 16 Gy at both stages. Median follow-up after the last stage of radiosurgery was 50 months (range, 3-159 mo). RESULTS: Four patients (14%) sustained a hemorrhage after radiosurgery; two died and two patients recovered with mild permanent neurological deficits. Worsened neurological deficits developed in one patient. Seizure control was improved in three patients, was stable in eight patients and worsened in two. Magnetic resonance imaging showed T2 prolongation in four patients (14%). Out of 28 patients, 21 had follow-up more than 36 months. Out of 21 patients, seven underwent repeat radiosurgery and none of them had enough follow- up. Of 14 patients followed for more than 36 months, seven (50%) had total, four (29%) near total, and three (21%) had moderate AVM obliteration. CONCLUSIONS: Prospective staged volume radiosurgery provided imaging defined volumetric reduction or closure in a series of large AVMs unsuitable for any other therapy.

The aura always occurred on the right and the headache always on the left side of the head, suggesting a structural lesion in the left occipital lobe. The lesion appeared to be an arteriovenous malformation of which almost full obliteration resulted in a decrease in frequency of the aura and in intensity of the headache.

23829820,A practical grading scale for predicting outcome after radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations: analysis of 1012 treated patients.,"OBJECT: The authors performed a study to review outcomes following Gamma Knife radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and to create a practical scale to predict long-term outcome. METHODS: Outcomes were reviewed in 1012 patients who were followed up for more than 2 years. Favorable outcome was defined as AVM obliteration and no posttreatment hemorrhage or permanent, symptomatic, radiation-induced complication. Preradiosurgery patient and AVM characteristics predictive of outcome in multivariate analysis were weighted according to their odds ratios to create the Virginia Radiosurgery AVM Scale. RESULTS: The mean follow-up time was 8 years (range 2-20 years). Arteriovenous malformation obliteration occurred in 69% of patients. Postradiosurgery hemorrhage occurred in 88 patients, for a yearly incidence of 1.14%. Radiation-induced changes occurred in 387 patients (38.2%), symptoms in 100 (9.9%), and permanent deficits in 21 (2.1%). Favorable outcome was achieved in 649 patients (64.1%). The Virginia Radiosurgery AVM Scale was created such that patients were assigned 1 point each for having an AVM volume of 2-4 cm(3), eloquent AVM location, or a history of hemorrhage, and 2 points for having an AVM volume greater than 4 cm(3). Eighty percent of patients who had a score of 0-1 points had a favorable outcome, as did 70% who had a score of 2 points and 45% who had a score of 3-4 points. The Virginia Radiosurgery AVM Scale was still predictive of outcome after controlling for predictive Gamma Knife radiosurgery treatment parameters, including peripheral dose and number of isocenters, in a multivariate analysis. The Spetzler-Martin grading scale and the Radiosurgery-Based Grading Scale predicted favorable outcome, but the Virginia Radiosurgery AVM Scale provided the best assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Gamma Knife radiosurgery can be used to achieve long-term AVM obliteration and neurological preservation in a predictable fashion based on patient and AVM characteristics.",2013 Oct,2013,Journal of neurosurgery,119,4,981-7,eng,True,10.3171/2013.5.JNS1311;10.3171/2013.5.JNS1311,Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Brain/diagnostic imaging/pathology/*surgery;Cerebral Angiography;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/pathology/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Predictive Value of Tests;Prognosis;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome,
11746940,Improved target volume characterization in stereotactic treatment planning of brain lesions by using high-resolution BOLD MR-venography.,"In this methodological paper I report the stereotactic correlation of different magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques [MR angiography (MRA), MRI, blood bolus tagging (STAR), functional MRI, and high-resolution BOLD venography (HRBV)] in patients with cerebral arterio-venous malformations (AVM) and brain tumors. The patient's head was fixed in a stereotactic localization system which is usable in both MR-systems and linear accelerator installations. Using phantom measurements global geometric MR image distortions can be 'corrected' (reducing displacements to the size of a pixel) by calculations based on modeling the distortion as a fourth-order two-dimensional polynomial. Further object-induced local distortions can be corrected by additionally measured field maps. Using this method multimodality matching could be performed automatically as long as all images are acquired in the same examination and the patient is sufficiently immobilized to allow precise definition of the target volume. Information about the hemodynamics of the AVM was provided by a dynamic MRA with the STAR technique, leading to an improved definition of the size of the nidus, the origin of the feeding arteries, whereas HRBV imaging yielded detailed and improved information about the venous pattern and drainage. In addition, functional MRI was performed in patients with lesions close to the primary motor cortex area, leading to an improved definition of structures at risk for the high-dose application in radiosurgery. In patients with brain tumors the potential of HRBV to probe tumor angiogenesis and its use in intensity-modulated treatment planning is still hampered by the open question of how to translate a BOLD signal pattern measured in the tumor to a dose distribution, which should be addressed in future studies.",2001 Nov-Dec,2001,NMR in biomedicine,14,7-8,478-83,eng,False,10.1002/nbm.714;10.1002/nbm.714,Journal Article,Brain Neoplasms/*pathology/surgery;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*pathology/surgery;*Magnetic Resonance Angiography;Oxygen/*blood;*Phlebography;*Radiosurgery,
27689461,Stereotactic radiosurgery for cerebellar arteriovenous malformations: an international multicenter study.,"OBJECTIVE Cerebellar arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) represent the majority of infratentorial AVMs and frequently have a hemorrhagic presentation. In this multicenter study, the authors review outcomes of cerebellar AVMs after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). METHODS Eight medical centers contributed data from 162 patients with cerebellar AVMs managed with SRS. Of these patients, 65% presented with hemorrhage. The median maximal nidus diameter was 2 cm. Favorable outcome was defined as AVM obliteration and no posttreatment hemorrhage or permanent radiation-induced complications (RICs). Patients were followed clinically and radiographically, with a median follow-up of 60 months (range 7-325 months). RESULTS The overall actuarial rates of obliteration at 3, 5, 7, and 10 years were 38.3%, 74.2%, 81.4%, and 86.1%, respectively, after single-session SRS. Obliteration and a favorable outcome were more likely to be achieved in patients treated with a margin dose greater than 18 Gy (p < 0.001 for both), demonstrating significantly better rates (83.3% and 79%, respectively). The rate of latency preobliteration hemorrhage was 0.85%/year. Symptomatic post-SRS RICs developed in 4.5% of patients (n = 7). Predictors of a favorable outcome were a smaller nidus (p = 0.0001), no pre-SRS embolization (p = 0.003), no prior hemorrhage (p = 0.0001), a higher margin dose (p = 0.0001), and a higher maximal dose (p = 0.009). The Spetzler-Martin grade was not found to be predictive of outcome. The Virginia Radiosurgery AVM Scale score (p = 0.0001) and the Radiosurgery-Based AVM Scale score (p = 0.0001) were predictive of a favorable outcome. CONCLUSIONS SRS results in successful obliteration and a favorable outcome in the majority of patients with cerebellar AVMs. Most patients will require a nidus dose of higher than 18 Gy to achieve these goals.

36130658,Risk Factors of Brain Arteriovenous Malformation Embolization as Adjunctive Therapy: Single-Center 10-Year Experience.,"OBJECTIVE: In the multimodality treatment of complex brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), the role of endovascular embolization is not fully elucidated. To assess the risk of embolization, we retrospectively evaluated the outcomes of endovascular treatment for AVM, focusing on the embolization-related complications. METHODS: The present study included patients with brain AVM who underwent embolization at our hospital between April 2011 and May 2021. Risk factors for peri- and postoperative complications were analyzed. RESULTS: During the study period, 36 AVMs were treated during 58 embolization sessions. The goal of the embolization was preoperative in 24 (67%), pre-radiosurgical in 9 (25%), and palliative in 3 (8%) cases. The overall complication rate was 43% (25 of 58) per session and 36% (13 of 36) per patient. Ischemic and hemorrhagic complications were observed in 14 (24%) and 14 (24%) cases, respectively. n-Butyl cyanoacrylate (n-BCA) embolization was detected as the significant risk for postoperative hemorrhage in the univariate (79% vs. 36%, P = 0.012; Fisher exact test) and the multivariable analysis (odds ratio 4.90, 95% confidence interval 1.08-22.2, P = 0.039). The number of embolized feeder in a single session also tended to be higher in a hemorrhagic complication group (median 3.5 vs. 2.0, P = 0.11; Mann-Whitney U-test). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of embolization in multimodality treatment for complex brain AVM was substantial. n-BCA embolization may carry a higher risk of postoperative hemorrhage.

31078806,Postobliteration Arteriovenous Malformation Mimicking Malignant Change 30 Years After X-Knife Treatment-Case Report and Review of Literature.,"BACKGROUND: Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are potentially dangerous vascular anomalies of the brain that can cause seizures or intracranial hemorrhage in patients if left untreated. Because full excision of these lesions is not always possible in deep or eloquent areas of the brain, radiosurgical advances have gone a long way in the control and treatment of AVMs. Postradiosurgery AVMs are followed closely via outpatient clinics with serial imaging every few months to assess AVM obliteration. Post X-knife treatment AVMs still carry with them some risk of rebleeding and even a chance of malignant transformation. CASE DESCRIPTION: In this article, we report a case of a post X-knife-treated arteriovenous malformation with the appearance of malignant change on magnetic resonance imaging and thallium-201 on follow-up 30 years after treatment. Imaging with magnetic resonance angiography showed obliteration of the lesion but progressive change in size with new soft tissue components, which suggests radiation-related secondary malignancy.

19199449,Outcome after hemorrhage following Gamma Knife surgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECT: Although the effects of Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) on the risk of hemorrhage are poorly understood, a certain subset of patients does suffer bleeding after GKS. This study was undertaken to analyze the outcome of patients sustaining hemorrhage after GKS; it is the most feared complication of radiosurgical management of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). METHODS: Between May 1997 and June 2006, 494 cerebral AVMs in 489 patients were treated using a Leksell Gamma Knife Model B, and follow-up evaluations were conducted until June 2007 at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi. Fourteen patients who sustained a hemorrhage after GKS formed the study group. In most of these patients conservative management was chosen. RESULTS: The mortality rate was 0% and there was a 7% risk of sustaining a severe deficit following rebleeding after GKS. None of the patients sustained rebleeding after complete obliteration. Patients with Spetzler-Martin Grade III or less had increased chances of hemorrhage after GKS (p < 0.002). The presence of deep venous drainage, aneurysm, venous hypertension, or periventricular location on angiography was common in patients with hemorrhage after GKS. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of hemorrhage that remains following GKS for cerebral AVMs is highest in the 1st year after treatment. The present study showed a relatively good outcome even in cases with hemorrhage following GKS, with no deaths and minimal morbidity, further substantiating the safety and efficacy of the procedure.",2009 May,2009,Journal of neurosurgery,110,5,1003-9,eng,False,10.3171/2008.10.17675;10.3171/2008.10.17675;10.3171/2008.10.17675,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Cerebral Hemorrhage/*etiology/mortality;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Postoperative Complications;*Radiosurgery",
18503330,Management and outcome of hemorrhage after Gamma Knife surgery for arteriovenous malformations of the brain.,"OBJECT: Appropriate management of hemorrhage after Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) for arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the brain is poorly understood, although a certain proportion of patients suffer from hemorrhage. METHODS: Among 500 patients observed for 1 to 183 months (median 70 months) after GKS, 32 patients (6.4%) suffered a hemorrhage. Hemorrhage developed even after angiographically documented obliteration of the AVM in five (2%) of 250 patients followed for 1 to 133 months (median 75 months) post-GKS. These patients had been treated according to their pathological condition. Treatment of these patients and their outcomes were retrospectively reviewed. As a management strategy in patients with preobliteration hemorrhage, the intracerebral hematoma and the AVM nidus were removed in four patients, and chronic encapsulated hematoma was removed in three. Among 11 patients who were conservatively treated, AVMs were ultimately obliterated in five, including three patients who underwent repeated GKS. Intracerebral hematoma from angiographically documented obliterated AVMs was radically resected in two patients, including one who also underwent aspiration of an accompanying symptomatic cyst. Intraoperative bleeding was easily controlled in these patients. Outcomes after hemorrhage, measured with the modified Rankin Scale, were significantly better in patients with postobliteration hemorrhage than in those with preobliteration hemorrhage (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Various types of hemorrhagic complications after GKS for AVMs can be properly managed based on an understanding of each pathological condition. Although a small risk of bleeding remains after angiographically demonstrated obliteration, surgery for such AVMs is safe, and the patient outcomes are more favorable. Radical resection to prevent further hemorrhage is recommended for ruptured AVMs after obliteration because such AVMs can cause repeated hemorrhages.",2006 Dec,2006,Journal of neurosurgery,105 Suppl,,52-7,eng,False,10.3171/sup.2006.105.7.52,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Child;Cohort Studies;Disease-Free Survival;Female;Hemostatic Techniques;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/mortality/*surgery;Intracranial Hemorrhages/diagnosis/*etiology/*therapy;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult,
25118192,Angiographic factors influencing the success of endovascular treatment of arteriovenous malformations involving the corpus callosum.,"OBJECTIVE: Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the corpus callosum are rare lesions, accounting for 9-11% of brain AVMs. Microsurgical resection of such lesions is difficult because of their deep location, and also because of possible neuropsychological disasters resulting from extended callosal resection. The introduction of endovascular and radiation therapies has fundamentally changed the outcome of these lesions. METHODS: We prospectively collected clinical and angiographic data on cerebral AVMs from 1995. We reviewed data from patients treated for an AVM of the corpus callosum and identified the factors influencing the endovascular approach of such lesions. RESULTS: 38 patients (mean age 31 years) were consecutively treated by endovascular techniques. 78.9% (30 cases) of patients presented with intracranial hemorrhage. 15 AVMs (39.5%) were anterior, 18 (47.4%) were posterior, and five (13.1%) were holocallosal. The Spetzler-Martin grade was I in two cases (5.2%), II in 20 cases (52.6%), III in nine cases (23.7%), IV in six cases (15.8%), and V in one case (2.6%). The nidus was compact in 19 cases (50%), diffuse in 13 (34.2%), and multifocal in six (15.8%). Both anterior and posterior circulation branches fed 14 nidi (36.8%). Venous drainage was superficial in three cases (7.9%), deep in 28 (73.7%), and both in seven cases (18.4%). 104 sessions were performed, with a procedural complication rate of 6.7%. Mean follow-up was 43.6 months, with the last modified Rankin Scale score <3 in 33 cases (86.8%). 22 patients (57.9%) were totally cured. Univariate analysis of factors influencing the success of endovascular treatment showed that Spetzler-Martin grade ≥3 (p=0.046), nidus >30 mm (p=0.02), extension in an eloquent area (p=0.03), and holocallosal type (p0.005) significantly diminished the chances of cure of the AVM. CONCLUSIONS: AVMs of the corpus callosum seems to be difficult to treat with endovascular therapy alone. The goal of embolization should be prevention of (re) bleeding and a decrease in nidus size. Our experience regarding this sub-pathology suggests that a combination of endovascular therapy and radiotherapy may be the best option.",2015 Oct,2015,Journal of neurointerventional surgery,7,10,715-20,eng,False,10.1136/neurintsurg-2014-011271;neurintsurg-2014-011271;10.1136/neurintsurg-2014-011271,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Cerebral Angiography/*methods;Child;Child, Preschool;Corpus Callosum/*blood supply;Embolization, Therapeutic/*methods;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnostic imaging/surgery/*therapy;Intracranial Hemorrhages/*diagnostic imaging/surgery/*therapy;Male;Middle Aged;*Outcome Assessment, Health Care;Radiosurgery/methods;Young Adult",Arteriovenous Malformation;Embolic;Hemorrhage;Liquid Embolic Material
26704216,Delayed Hemorrhage After Treatment of Brain Arteriovenous Malformations (AVMs).,"OBJECTIVE: The risk of delayed hemorrhage occurring greater than 2 years after treatment in brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) rarely is reported. In this study, we compare the risk of delayed hemorrhage across different treatment modalities. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of treated patients with a single intracranial AVM seen at our institution from 1990 to 2013. Delayed hemorrhage was defined as hemorrhage occurring at least 2 years after last treatment. Survival analysis was used to assess risk of delayed hemorrhage by treatment modalities. RESULTS: Our study included 420 patients. Spetzler-Martin grades were as follows: I (12.6%), II (36.2%), III (32.6%), IV (15.0%), and V (3.6%). Average follow-up time is 5.1 years. Twenty-two patients (5.2%) were found to have 28 delayed hemorrhages. Average interval between last treatment and delayed hemorrhage was 7.6 years, with the longest being 24.2 years. Proportions of delayed hemorrhages by treatment modalities were as follows: surgery ± embolization (group I, 9.1%), radiosurgery ± embolization (group II, 63.6%), embolization only (group III, 22.7%), and surgery + radiosurgery ± embolization (group IV, 4.5%). Annualized hemorrhage risk after 2 years for each treatment group was as follows: group I (0.4%), group II (1.2%), group III (3.7%), and group IV (1.7%). Survival analysis demonstrated lowest risk of delayed hemorrhage for group 1 (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to compare the risk of delayed hemorrhage across different treatment modalities. Surgical resection is associated with the lowest risk for delayed hemorrhage compared with other treatment modalities.

20871437,Early draining vein occlusion after gamma knife surgery for arteriovenous malformations.,"BACKGROUND: Increased signals on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging usually interpreted as radiation-induced changes or brain edema is a common short- to mid-term complication after Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) for intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), although its nature remains to be clarified. Early draining vein occlusion with resultant brain edema or hemorrhage, although well established in surgical series, was not described in radiosurgical literature until recently. OBJECTIVE: To outline the incidence, clinical manifestations, and outcomes of this unusual complication in our series of 1256 AVM patients treated with GKS. METHODS: From 1989 to 2008, 1400 patients underwent GKS for cerebral AVMs or dural arteriovenous fistulae at the University of Virginia. In 1256 patients, magnetic resonance imaging after GKS was available for analysis of radiation-induced changes and early draining vein occlusion. RESULTS: After GKS, 456 patients (36%) developed radiation-induced changes surrounding the treated nidi. Among these patients, 12 had early thrombosis of the draining vein accompanied by radiation-induced changes. Venous thrombosis occurred 6 to 25 months (median 11.6 months) after GKS. Three patients were asymptomatic on the image findings of venous occlusion and brain edema, 3 experienced headache, 1 had seizure and headache, and neurological deficits developed in 5. Patients with neurological deficits were treated with corticosteroids; 2 of the patients recovered completely, 1 still had slight hemiparesis, 1 had short-term memory deficits, and 1 died of massive intracerebral hemorrhage. CONCLUSION: Although venous structures are considered more radioresistant, endothelial damage accompanied by venous flow stasis might cause early venous thrombosis and premature venous occlusion after radiosurgery for AVMs. In our series, all patients had a favorable outcome except 1 with a fatal hemorrhage.",2010 Nov,2010,Neurosurgery,67,5,1293-302; discussion 1302,eng,False,10.1227/NEU.0b013e3181f2b396;10.1227/NEU.0b013e3181f2b396,Journal Article,Adult;Aged;Arteriovenous Fistula/*epidemiology/*surgery;Comorbidity;Female;Humans;Incidence;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*epidemiology/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Postoperative Complications/*epidemiology;Radiosurgery/*statistics & numerical data;Risk Assessment;Risk Factors;Venous Thrombosis/*epidemiology;Virginia/epidemiology,
19123891,Optimal timing for Gamma Knife surgery after hemorrhage from brain arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECT: Optimal timing of Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) after hemorrhage from brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is unclear and of concern to neurosurgeons because GKS is usually performed after absorption of the hematoma. The authors investigated whether waiting for hematoma absorption is beneficial and aimed to clarify the optimal treatment timing. METHODS: The authors retrospectively studied 211 patients with AVMs who presented with hemorrhage and underwent GKS as the initial treatment. Patients were categorized into 3 groups according to the interval between the time of first hemorrhage and GKS, as follows: Group 1, 0-3 months (70 patients); Group 2, 3-6 months (62 patients); and Group 3, > 6 months (79 patients). The obliteration rates, number of hemorrhages before and after GKS, and complication rates were compared between these 3 groups. The authors also analyzed a subgroup of 127 patients who presented with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) to identify the influence of ICH on outcome. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 6.3 years, the rates of obliteration, hemorrhage after treatment, and complication were not significantly different between the 3 groups even though the patients with a longer interval before GKS (Group 3) had more AVMs in eloquent areas and neurological deficits. However, the numbers of patients with preoperative hemorrhage in the interval before GKS was significantly higher in Group 3 (1, 3, and 20 patients in Group 1, 2, and 3, respectively). These results were similar in the analyses of 127 patients presenting with ICH. CONCLUSIONS: No benefit was detected in waiting for hematoma absorption until GKS after hemorrhage from AVM. Because of higher hemorrhagic risk until GKS > 6 months after hemorrhage, the authors recommend GKS within 6 months after hemorrhage.",2008 Dec,2008,Journal of neurosurgery,109 Suppl,,73-6,eng,True,10.3171/JNS/2008/109/12/S12;10.3171/JNS/2008/109/12/S12,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Adult;Cohort Studies;Female;Hematoma/etiology/pathology/*surgery;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/*surgery;Intracranial Hemorrhages/etiology/pathology/*surgery;Male;Radiosurgery/*methods;Radiotherapy Dosage;Retrospective Studies;Time Factors;Treatment Outcome,
11404709,[Radiosurgery of cerebral arteriovenous malformations in children].,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Radiosurgery has been used in a few cases of cerebral arteriovenous malformations in children. From data of our series and from literature, we tried to determine the place of this therapeutic modality for treatment of pediatric cAVMs. PATIENTS AND METHOD: From the whole series of 705 patients treated by radiosurgery between January 84 and December 1998, 55 were under 15 years of age. Revelation mode was hemorrhage (70.9%), seizures (12.7%), headaches (10.9%) and neurological progressive deficits (1.8%). Size ranged from 5 to 50 mm (mean: 22 mm) and volume ranged from 1 to 16 cc (mean: 4 cc). Treatments prior radiosurgery were embolization alone (28%), surgery alone (16.7%), embolization plus surgery (5.5%). Distribution of cerebral arteriovenous malformations according to Spetzler & Martin's grading were 10% in grade I, 35% in grade II, 40% in grade III, 15% in grade IV and 0% in grade V. RESULTS: Overall obliteration rate was 59% with an exaustibility rate of 80%. Obliteration rate was dependent on size and volume (100% for<1 cc cerebral arteriovenous malformations sized, 73% from 1-4 cc, 40% from 4-10 cc and 100% (but n=1)>10 cc; p=0.019), sex (84.2% for boys and 40% for girls), of angioarchitecture and Dmin (p=0.01). After multivariate analysis, only Dmin was nearly correlated with the obliteration rate (b=0.462 7; SE=0.244 0; p=0.057). Actuarial risk of hemorrhage was 2.12% per year per patient. Patients with seizures were seizure-free without any drugs after radiosurgery in 80% of cases. Parenchymal changes were mainly hypersignals spT2 in MRI.

23258509,Development and testing of a radiosurgery-based arteriovenous malformation grading system.,"Stereotactic radiosurgery is an accepted management option for many patients with intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). The Spetzler-Martin grading scale is the most widely accepted and utilized method to predict outcomes after surgical resection of intracranial AVMs but is not sensitive to factors that correlate with successful AVM radiosurgery. The need for a system that accurately predicts patient outcomes after AVM radiosurgery led to the development of the radiosurgery-based AVM score (RBAS). The RBAS has evolved and has been modified over the years to reflect changes in AVM radiosurgical technique and has been validated by numerous centers using the Gamma Knife®, modified LINAC and the CyberKnife®. Use of the RBAS permits an accurate prediction of outcomes from radiosurgery to guide choices between observation, surgical resection or radiosurgery for individual AVM patients, and should be used in future studies on AVM radiosurgery to stratify patients for more precise comparative analyses.",2013,2013,Progress in neurological surgery,27,,58-66,eng,False,10.1159/000341620;000341620;10.1159/000341620,Journal Article;Review,Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnosis/*surgery;Humans;Radiosurgery/methods/*standards/*trends;*Severity of Illness Index;Treatment Outcome,
16905882,The impact of arteriovenous malformation radiosurgery on the brain: From morphology and perfusion to neurocognition.,"The therapeutic aims of brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM) radiosurgery are multiple. Protecting patients from rebleeding is the prime goal. Among the others, hemodynamics, perfusion and neurocognition recovery are interesting and important. Anatomically AVM contains an abnormal cluster of vascular networks (nidus) between arteries and veins. Hemodynamically the nidus contains a low resistance and causes high-flow transnidal shunts between both sides of the nidus. The shunts cause hypotension in the neighboring arteries and diversion of blood from the adjacent brain tissues. The diversion disturbs brain hemodynamics. Radiosurgery, by eliminating the nidus, reconstitutes normal brain hemodynamics. From the early stage after radiosurgery, the abnormal transnidal flows gradually decrease, and the adjacent hemodynamics recovers toward normal. For nonhemorrhagic AVM, improvement of seizure control and stable or improved neurological status are observed clinically. The radiosurgical effects are also reflected in the recovery of metabolism in the adjacent brain and neurocognitive function paralleling the hemodynamic normalization. Morphological cure of AVM and the associated recovery of brain hemodynamics, metabolism and neurocognitive function form the therapeutic rationale of AVM radiosurgery.",2006,2006,Stereotactic and functional neurosurgery,84,4,162-9,eng,False,94955;10.1159/000094955,"Clinical Trial;Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Adolescent;Adult;Cerebral Angiography;*Cerebrovascular Circulation;Cognition Disorders/physiopathology/*surgery;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/physiopathology/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Angiography;Male;Postoperative Complications/physiopathology/prevention & control;Prospective Studies;*Radiosurgery;Recovery of Function;Treatment Outcome,

The objective of this study is to review our experience with radiosurgical treatment for these AVMs. METHODS: Between October 1989 and December 2000, 45 patients with deep AVMs (including basal ganglia, internal capsule, and thalamus) underwent stereotactic radiosurgery. Three patients were lost to follow-up and therefore were excluded from this study. Patient characteristics and outcomes were collected and analyzed. The obliteration prediction index and the radiosurgery-based AVM score were calculated and tested. RESULTS: Forty-two patients were followed up for a median of 39 months (range, 25-90 mo; mean, 45.8 mo). The median maximum AVM diameter during the radiosurgery was 1.8 cm (range, 0.9-4.0 cm; mean, 2.07 cm), and the median AVM volume was 2.8 cm(3) (range, 0.2-18.3 cm(3); mean, 4.74 cm(3)). The mean marginal dose was 16.2 Gy (median, 15 Gy), and the median maximum dose was 22.4 Gy (range, 16.6-30 Gy). The AVM cure rate after the first radiosurgical treatment, using angiography- and magnetic resonance imaging-confirmed obliteration, was 61.9%. The predicted obliteration using the obliteration prediction index was 60%. Eight patients developed radiation-induced complications (19%). The deficit was transient in three patients (7.1%) and permanent in five patients (11.9%). The risk of postradiosurgical hemorrhage in this cohort was 9.5% for the first year, 4.7% for the second year, and 0% thereafter. Excellent outcome (obliteration plus no new deficit) was achieved in 70% of the patients in the group with radiosurgery-based AVM score less than 1.5 compared with 40.9% in the group with radiosurgery-based AVM score greater than 1.5% (P = 0.059).

Data from a regional neurosurgical unit was analysed and compared with published series for the purposes of quality control. We also compared our surgical result with other treatment modalities from the whole AVM cohort managed over the same study period. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of a locally held AVM database. SUBJECTS: Of the 141 AVM patients, 54 (35M, 19F, age range 9-68 years) underwent microsurgical removal of AVM by the senior author, from 2006 to 2012. 27 (19%), 18 (13%), 20 (14%), 22 (16%) had endovascular therapy only, radiosurgery only, combination therapy (endovascular and radiosurgery) and conservative management, respectively. METHODS: Case notes were reviewed to determine clinical and radiological outcomes. Statistical analysis performed using SPSS with p < 0.05 defined as statistical significance. RESULTS: In the surgical series, the Spetzler-Martin (SM) grade distribution was as follows: 17 grade I (32%), 31 grade II (57%), and 6 grade III (11%). 31 patients (57%) presented with intracranial haemorrhage, 12 patients (22%) with seizures. Of the 54 patients, 51 (94%) had angiographically confirmed obliteration of their AVM. Median follow-up for the entire cohort was 7 years. 83% of surgical patients have mRS 0-1, compared to 78%, 67%, 45%, 18% of patients managed by endovascular therapy, radiosurgery, combination therapy, conservative surveillance, respectively (p < 0.0001). However, the groups were not comparable in terms of SM grade or clinical presentation and the numbers in each group were relatively small. Seizure presentations were encountered in 23% (32/141) of the overall patients, and all the surviving patients were on anticonvulsants, except in the surgical arm, 7/12 (58%) patients were off their antiepileptic medications at last follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate a 94% surgical obliteration rate and 11% long-term neurological deficits for brain AVM patients managed surgically and were comparable to expert series.

23294947,Microsurgical treatment of the interhemispheric arteriovenous malformations.,"From a total of 364 patients who underwent surgery for AVMs, 46 (12.63%) had lesions located interhemispherically. The majority of patients have entered the 4th and 5th age decade. The youngest operated patient was 18 years old and the oldest was 64. The most frequent clinical signs encountered were headaches (13 - 28.2%), epilepsy (21 - 45.65%), motor deficits (12 - 26.08%), sensitivity disorders (8 - 17.39%), speech disabilities (4 - 8.69%), visual field deficits (3 - 6.52%), mental disorders (5 - 10.85%) and alteration of consciousness (4 - 8.69%).The initial imagistic examination consisted of a noncontrast computed tomographic scan, followed by a magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and a digital subtraction angiography.

26100164,The Diagnosis and Management of Brain Arteriovenous Malformations in a Single Regional Center.,"BACKGROUND: Cerebral arteriovenous malformations are vascular abnormalities in which arteriovenous shunting occurs through an abnormal vascular network (nidus) in the parenchyma. These lesions typically present by the third decade of life with cerebral bleeding, seizures, headache, or neurologic deficits; however, they are sometimes found incidentally. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of intracranial AVMs referred to a single regional center, over a 7-year period, was performed to review the clinical presentation, pathologic features and management outcomes from January 2005 to December 2012. RESULTS: We identified 142 patients (56% female, age range 4-69 years). Emergency referrals accounted for 87% of the cohort with the most frequent presentation being headache and/or hemorrhage. More than half (52%) of the cases were observed to have a neurologic deficit on examination. The modal Spetzler-Martin Grade was 3 with 76% of lesions located in areas of eloquent brain and 57% of cases in the dominant hemisphere. Half of the cases had multiple feeder vessels, and 29% were associated with aneurysms. The nidus was obliterated in 91% of cases actively managed. Two thirds of patients were successfully treated with a single modality, the most common being embolization. Only 8% of cases were managed conservatively. Additionally, 93% of aneurysms identified were treated successfully. The complication rate was 7% with 2% of reported infection. CONCLUSIONS: The burden of AVM management is significantly enhanced by the number of emergency referrals. Interestingly, complication rates are higher in the unruptured cohort. Surgical management is the most effective modality, but it carries the highest complication rate.

25542309,Clinical realization of sector beam intensity modulation for Gamma Knife radiosurgery: a pilot treatment planning study.,"PURPOSE: To demonstrate the clinical feasibility and potential benefits of sector beam intensity modulation (SBIM) specific to Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery (GKSRS). METHODS AND MATERIALS: SBIM is based on modulating the confocal beam intensities from individual sectors surrounding an isocenter in a nearly 2π geometry. This is in contrast to conventional GKSRS delivery, in which the beam intensities from each sector are restricted to be either 0% or 100% and must be identical for any given isocenter. We developed a SBIM solution based on available clinical planning tools, and we tested it on a cohort of 12 clinical cases as a proof of concept study. The SBIM treatment plans were compared with the original clinically delivered treatment plans to determine dosimetric differences. The goal was to investigate whether SBIM would improve the dose conformity for these treatment plans without prohibitively lengthening the treatment time. RESULTS: A SBIM technique was developed. On average, SBIM improved the Paddick conformity index (PCI) versus the clinically delivered plans (clinical plan PCI = 0.68 ± 0.11 vs SBIM plan PCI = 0.74 ± 0.10, P=.002; 2-tailed paired t test). The SBIM plans also resulted in nearly identical target volume coverage (mean, 97 ± 2%), total beam-on times (clinical plan 58.4 ± 38.9 minutes vs SBIM 63.5 ± 44.7 minutes, P=.057), and gradient indices (clinical plan 3.03 ± 0.27 vs SBIM 3.06 ± 0.29, P=.44) versus the original clinical plans.

23269037,Role of stereotactic radiosurgery in the treatment of high-grade cerebral arteriovenous malformation.,"Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) with a small nidus located in the cortical eloquent areas is difficult to surgically resect without neurological complication, but is a suitable target for stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). However, lesions with large nidus volume or with deeply located nidus are difficult to safely treat, even by SRS. To explore the optimal treatment strategies for such high-grade cerebral AVM, we reviewed treatment outcomes of SRS using gamma knife surgery (GKS) for patients with high-grade AVM at our institute and in published reports. Although lesions in the thalamus and the brainstem carried higher risk of morbidity after SRS, accumulation of technical knowledge and experience about SRS and technological advances in dose planning have enabled safer treatment of AVM in these locations. Large AVM presents another challenge to SRS treatment. Multimodal treatment, including surgery and endovascular treatment, should be considered. In this setting, staged SRS using GKS or CyberKnife may achieve safer treatment of large cerebral AVM. Further progress in SRS is anticipated to enhance the treatment efficacy for high-grade cerebral AVM while reducing treatment morbidity.",2012,2012,Neurologia medico-chirurgica,52,12,845-51,eng,False,DN/JST.JSTAGE/nmc/52.845;10.2176/nmc.52.845,Journal Article,"Brain Damage, Chronic/prevention & control;Brain Stem/blood supply;Cerebral Angiography;Cerebral Cortex/blood supply;Combined Modality Therapy;Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/*surgery;Postoperative Complications/prevention & control;*Radiosurgery;Risk Factors;Thalamus/blood supply",
22482792,Multimodality management of Spetzler-Martin Grade III arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECT: Grade III arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are diverse because of their variations in size (S), location in eloquent cortex (E), and presence of central venous drainage (V). Because they may have implications for management and outcome, the authors evaluated these variations in the present study. METHODS: Between 1984 and 2010, 100 patients with Grade III AVMs were treated. The AVMs were categorized by Spetzler-Martin characteristics as follows: Type 1 = S1E1V1, Type 2 = S2E1V0, Type 3 = S2E0V1, and Type 4 = S3E0V0. The occurrence of a new neurological deficit, functional status (based on modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score) at discharge and follow-up, and radiological obliteration were correlated with demographic and morphological characteristics. RESULTS: One hundred patients (49 female and 51 male; age range 5-68 years, mean 35.8 years) were evaluated. The size of AVMs was less than 3 cm in 28 patients, 3-6 cm in 71, and greater than 6 cm in 1; 86 AVMs were located in eloquent cortex and 38 had central drainage. The AVMs were Type 1 in 28 cases, Type 2 in 60, Type 3 in 11, and Type 4 in 1. The authors performed embolization in 77 patients (175 procedures), surgery in 64 patients (74 surgeries), and radiosurgery in 49 patients (44 primary and 5 postoperative). The mortality rate following the management of these AVMs was 1%. Fourteen patients (14%) had new neurological deficits, with 5 (5%) being disabling (mRS score > 2) and 9 (9%) being nondisabling (mRS score ≤ 2) events. Patients with Type 1 AVMs (small size) had the best outcome, with 1 (3.6%) in 28 having a new neurological deficit, compared with 72 patients with larger AVMs, of whom 13 (18.1%) had a new neurological deficit (p < 0.002). Older age (> 40 years), malformation size > 3 cm, and nonhemorrhagic presentation predicted the occurrence of new deficits (p < 0.002). Sex, eloquent cortex, and venous drainage did not confer any benefit. In 89 cases follow-up was adequate for data to be included in the obliteration analysis. The AVM was obliterated in 78 patients (87.6%), 69 of them (88.5%) demonstrated on angiography and 9 on MRI /MR angiography. There was no difference between obliteration rates between different types of AVMs, size, eloquence, and drainage. Age, sex, and clinical presentation also did not predict obliteration. CONCLUSIONS: Multimodality management of Grade III AVMs results in a high rate of obliteration, which was not influenced by size, venous drainage, or eloquent location. However, the development of new neurological deficits did correlate with size, whereas eloquence and venous drainage did not affect the neurological complication rate.

OBJECTIVE: To identify the warning signs of post-AO hemorrhage by analyzing the characteristics of enhancement on contrast-enhanced MRI magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of AVMs with post-AO hemorrhage. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 121 patients whose AVMs were angiographically obliterated within 5 years of GKRS without hemorrhage and who received at least 1 contrast-enhanced MRI after GKRS (group 1), and 7 patients who experienced post-AO hemorrhage (group 2). We analyzed the enhancement persistence ratio (the percentage of AVMs with persisting enhancement on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted image after obliteration) and the change in size of the enhanced region over time in each patient. RESULTS: The enhancement persistence ratio showed no significant difference between the 2 groups (89.4% vs 100% for groups 1 and 2, respectively; P=.401). While most cases in group 1 showed a tendency to decrease in size and gradually stabilize following GKRS, there were significantly more cases in group 2 with obvious increment of the enhanced regions within 1 year of angiographic obliteration compared with the previous measurement (4.96% vs 71.4% for groups 1 and 2, respectively; P<.0001). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that AVMs that show an increase in the size of the enhanced region within 1 year of angiographic obliteration should be followed up with caution for post-AO hemorrhage. Persisting enhancement itself is not positively associated with subsequent hemorrhage.",2010 Jul,2010,Neurosurgery,67,1,100-9; discussion 109,eng,False,00006123-201007000-00015;10.1227/01.NEU.0000370601.17570.4>,Journal Article,Cerebral Hemorrhage/diagnostic imaging/*etiology/pathology;Contrast Media/*adverse effects;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*complications/*diagnostic;Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*adverse effects;Postoperative Complications/*etiology/physiopathology;Postoperative Period;Predictive Value of Tests;Radiography;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects;Retrospective Studies,
23454686,Multimodality treatment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"BACKGROUND: Many arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) can be treated with one modality, but with increasing complexity a combination of techniques, including surgical excision, embolization, and radiosurgery, may be beneficial. The 2 senior authors' experience in the multimodal management of AVMs from 1980-2008 is reported, including the results in all patients with rehemorrhage while awaiting treatment or after partial initial treatment has begun. The series contains a disproportionately high number of Spetzler-Martin grade IV and V lesions, owing to the nature of the referral practice. METHODS: Data were collected prospectively. Only patients who were managed until treatment options were exhausted were included; this entailed either treatment to the point of AVM obliteration or inability to treat further using any or all modalities. Patients who presented with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in extremis in whom the AVM was excised during the first operation were also included. RESULTS: Of the 290 patients, 265 underwent treatment, and 25 were managed conservatively. An unruptured AVM was present in 48% of patients. Cure was achieved in 233 (88%) of treated patients. Cure was achieved in 25 of 37 patients undergoing radiosurgery only, 56 of 57 undergoing surgery, 100 of 101 undergoing embolization and microsurgical excision, 20 of 34 undergoing embolization alone, 12 of 17 undergoing embolization and radiosurgery, 5 of 5 undergoing surgery and radiosurgery, and 14 of 14 patients undergoing all 3 modalities. Spetzler-Martin grade was found to correlate negatively with cure (P < 0.001). There was a good outcome in 210 patients (72%), moderate disability in 40 patients (14%), severe disability in 22 patients (8%), vegetative state in 1 patient, and 17 patients (6%) died. There was a favorable outcome (no or only moderate deficits) in 93% of patients with Spetzler-Martin grade I-III lesions. The outcome was favorable in 13 of 25 patients (52%) having no treatment, 32 of 37 (86%) having radiosurgery only, 30 of 34 (88%) having embolization only, 54 of 57 (95%) having surgery only, 87 of 101 (86%) having embolization and surgery, 16 of 17 (94%) having embolization and radiosurgery, 5 of 5 (100%) having surgery and radiosurgery, and 13 of 14 (93%) having all 3 modalities. These outcomes included morbidity from initial presenting symptoms, from treatment, and from rehemorrhage. Good recovery was more likely in patients who were treated with surgery as one of the treatments (P = .025). Considering only new deficits related to treatment, 9 patients (3%) incurred severe neurologic deficits, 11 patents died after treatment, 2 patients died of postoperative hematomas, and 6 died of rehemorrhage from residual AVM. Increasing age, Spetzler-Martin grade, and rehemorrhage were correlated with a poorer Glasgow Outcome Scale score (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest a higher risk of hemorrhage after partial obliteration of AVM. One should ascertain an acceptably high likelihood of complete obliteration before embarking on treatment. Using a multimodality approach, the authors were able to cure 92% of treated Spetzler-Martin grade I-IV lesions but only 53% of treated Spetzler-Martin grade V lesions. A major neurologic deficit, disabling to the patient, was incurred in 3% of cases, and 11 patients died.",2014 Jul-Aug,2014,World neurosurgery,82,1-2,149-59,eng,True,S1878-8750(13)00350-1;10.1016/j.wneu.2013.02.064;S1878-8750(13)00350-1;10.1016/j.wneu.2013.02.064,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Cerebral Revascularization/*methods;Child;Combined Modality Therapy;Embolization, Therapeutic/*methods;Female;Glasgow Outcome Scale;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/mortality/surgery/*therapy;Intracranial Hemorrhages/etiology;Male;Middle Aged;Nervous System Diseases/epidemiology/etiology;Neurosurgical Procedures/*methods;Postoperative Complications/epidemiology/mortality/therapy;Postoperative Hemorrhage/mortality;Prospective Studies;Radiosurgery/*methods;Recurrence;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",Arteriovenous malformation;Cerebral;Embolization;Hemorrhage;Multimodal;Radiosurgery;Surgery

Exclusion criteria were insufficient follow-up time (<36 months) or incomplete information. Patients' demographics, clinical presentation, treatment parameters, and results were analyzed. Excellent outcome was defined as AVM obliteration without a new neurological deficit. Risk factors for achieving excellent outcome were assessed.From a total of 277 CKSRS treatments for bAVM during the 6 years, 170 AVMs in 166 patients met the inclusion criteria. One hundred and thirty-nine cases (81.76%) presented with hemorrhages from ruptured bAVMs. Almost two-thirds underwent embolization before radiosurgery. With the median AVM volume of 4.17 mL, three-quarters of the cohort had single-fraction CKSRS, utilizing the median prescribed dose of 15 Gray (Gy). In the multisession group (25.29%), the median prescribed dose and the AVM volume were 27.5 Gy and 22.3 mL, respectively. An overall excellent outcome, at a median follow-up period of 72.45 months, was observed in 99 cases (58.24%). Seven AVMs (4.12%) ruptured after CKSRS but 1 patient suffered a new neurological deficit. Two patients (1.18%) were classified into the poor outcome category but there were no deaths. Negative factors for excellent outcome, by multivariate regression analysis, were the male sex and multisession SRS delivery, but not age, history of AVM rupture, previous embolization, or AVM volume.Despite relatively larger bAVM and utilizing a lower prescribed radiation dose, the excellent outcome was within the reported range from previous literature.

19669814,AVM resection after radiation therapy--clinico-morphological features and microsurgical results.,"A subgroup of patients initially treated by radiosurgery underwent surgical resection because of recurrent hemorrhage or neurological deterioration. In a retrospective study, we want to analyze the clinical features of these patients and evaluate the effect of microneurosurgery in such rare constellations. Moreover, we hope to find answers about failure of radiation therapy in these cases by correlation of radiobiological and histopathological data. Over a 16-year-period, eight patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) underwent surgical resection, who previously were treated by radiosurgery. The mean duration between radiation therapy and final resection was 7 years. Preoperative evaluation revealed Spetzler-Martin grade III (n=5) and IV (n=3) AVMs. Histological examination was achieved in all resected lesions. Mean neurological follow-up was 14 months. Indications for surgical resection were intracerebral hematoma, progressive neurological deficit, and epilepsy. In comparison to the initial angiographic study before radiation therapy, preoperative angiography revealed newly developed ""en passant"" feeding vessels and stenosis of the main venous drainage in some patients. The mean Rankin score for all patients was 2.75 before and 3.25 after surgical resection. Postoperatively, three patients (38%) developed neurological deterioration. Histological examination of the resected tissue revealed significant radiation-induced pathology in six patients. We did not see correlation between radiation doses and severity of histolopathological radiation-induced changes. Postoperative angiography confirmed total AVM resection in all patients. AVMs insufficiently treated by radiation bear an increased surgical risk. Often, angiographic studies revealed a more complicated morphology.

19123887,Definition of the key target volume in radiosurgical management of arteriovenous malformations: a new dynamic concept based on angiographic circulation time.,"OBJECT: The cumulative experience worldwide indicates complete radiosurgical obliteration rates of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) ranging from 35 to 90%. The purpose of this study was to propose a strategy to increase the obliteration rate for AVMs through the dynamic definition of the key target volume (KTV). METHODS: A prospective series of patients harboring an AVM was assessed using digital subtraction angiography in which a digital counter was used to measure the several stages of the frame-by-frame circulation time. All the patients were analyzed using dynamic measurement planning to define the KTV, corresponding to the volume of the shunt with the least vascular resistance and the earliest venous drainage. All patients underwent catheter-based angiography, a subgroup was additionally assessed by means of a superselective catheterization, and among these a further subgroup received embolization. The shunts were also categorized according to their angioarchitectural type: fistulous, plexiform, or mixed. The authors applied the radiosurgery-based grading system (RBGS) as well to find a correlation with the obliteration rate. RESULTS: This series includes 44 patients treated by radiosurgery; global angiography was performed for all patients, including dynamic measurement planning. Eighty-four percent of them underwent superselective catheterization, and 50% of the total population underwent embolization. In the embolized arm of the study, the pretreatment volume was up to 120 ml. In patients with a single treatment, the mean volume was 8.5 ml, and the median volume was 6.95 +/- 4.56 ml (mean +/- standard deviation), with a KTV of up to 15 ml. For prospectively staged radiosurgery, the mean KTV was 28 ml. The marginal radiation dose was 18-22 Gy, with a mean of dose 20 Gy. The mean RBGS score was 1.70. The overall obliteration rate was 91%, including the repeated radiosurgery group (4 patients), in which 100% showed complete obliteration. The overall permanent deficit was 2 of 44 patients, 1 in each group. CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic definition of the KTV might increase the obliteration rate, even in complex AVMs, allowing the treatment of smaller volumes off the recruitment vessels (pseudonidus). By using this technique, the authors avoided double-blind treatment, where the neurosurgeon does not know precisely which type of lesion he or she is irradiating and the interventionalist does not know why and what he or she is embolizing.",2008 Dec,2008,Journal of neurosurgery,109 Suppl,,41-50,eng,True,10.3171/JNS/2008/109/12/S8;10.3171/JNS/2008/109/12/S8,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Angiography, Digital Subtraction;Blood Flow Velocity/*physiology;Cerebral Angiography;Cerebrovascular Circulation/*physiology;Child;Child, Preschool;Cohort Studies;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic;Male;Middle Aged;Predictive Value of Tests;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",
32562682,"Medical management with interventional therapy versus medical management alone for unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations (ARUBA): final follow-up of a multicentre, non-blinded, randomised controlled trial.","BACKGROUND: In A Randomized trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous malformations (ARUBA), randomisation was halted at a mean follow-up of 33·3 months after a prespecified interim analysis showed that medical management alone was superior to the combination of medical management and interventional therapy in preventing symptomatic stroke or death. We aimed to study whether these differences persisted through 5-years' follow-up. METHODS: ARUBA was a non-blinded, randomised trial done at 39 clinical centres in nine countries. Adults (age ≥18 years) diagnosed with an unruptured brain arteriovenous malformation, who had never undergone interventional therapy, and were considered by participating clinical centres to be suitable for intervention to eradicate the lesion, were eligible for inclusion. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by a web-based data collection system, stratified by clinical centre in a random permuted block design with block sizes of two, four, and six, to medical management alone or with interventional therapy (neurosurgery, embolisation, or stereotactic radiotherapy, alone or in any combination, sequence, or number). Although patients and investigators at a given centre were not masked to treatment assignment, investigators at other centres and those in the clinical coordinating centre were not informed of assignment or outcomes at any of the centres. The primary outcome was time to death or symptomatic stroke confirmed by imaging, assessed by a neurologist at each centre not involved in the management of participants' care, and monitored by an independent committee using an adaptive approach with interim analyses. Enrolment began on April 4, 2007, and was halted on April 15, 2013, after which follow-up continued until July 15, 2015. All analyses were by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00389181. FINDINGS: Of 1740 patients screened, 226 were randomly assigned to medical management alone (n=110) or medical management plus interventional therapy (n=116). During a mean follow-up of 50·4 months (SD 22·9), the incidence of death or symptomatic stroke was lower with medical management alone (15 of 110, 3·39 per 100 patient-years) than with medical management with interventional therapy (41 of 116, 12·32 per 100 patient-years; hazard ratio 0·31, 95% CI 0·17 to 0·56). Two patients in the medical management group and four in the interventional therapy group (two attributed to intervention) died during follow-up. Adverse events were observed less often in patients allocated to medical management compared with interventional therapy (283 vs 369; 58·97 vs 78·73 per 100 patient-years; risk difference -19·76, 95% CI -30·33 to -9·19). INTERPRETATION: After extended follow-up, ARUBA showed that medical management alone remained superior to interventional therapy for the prevention of death or symptomatic stroke in patients with an unruptured brain arteriovenous malformation. The data concerning the disparity in outcomes should affect standard specialist practice and the information presented to patients. The even longer-term risks and differences between the two therapeutic approaches remains uncertain.

19209384,Radiosurgery for large cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"BACKGROUND: Radiosurgery is an effective treatment option for patients with small to medium sized arteriovenous malformations. However, it is not generally accepted as an effective tool for larger (>14 cm(3)) arteriovenous malformations because of low obliteration rates. The authors assessed the applicability and effectiveness of radiosurgery for large arteriovenous malformations. METHOD: We performed a retrospective study of 46 consecutive patients with more than 14 ml of arteriovenous malformations who were treated with radiosurgery using a linear accelerator and gamma knife (GK). They were grouped according to their initial clinical presentation-17 presented with and 29 without haemorrhage. To assess the effect of embolization, these 46 patients were also regrouped into two subgroups-25 with and 21 without preradiosurgical embolization. Arteriovenous malformations found to have been incompletely obliterated after 3-year follow-up neuroimaging studies were re-treated using a GK. FINDINGS: The mean treatment volume was 29.5 ml (range, 14.0-65.0) and the mean marginal dose was 14.1 Gy (range, 10.0-20.0). The mean clinical follow-up periods after initial radiosurgery was 78.1 months (range, 34.0-166.4). Depending on the results of the angiography, 11 of 33 patients after the first radiosurgery and three of four patients after the second radiosurgery showed complete obliteration. Twenty patients received the second radiosurgery and their mean volume was significantly smaller than their initial volume (P = 0.017). The annual haemorrhage rate after radiosurgery was 2.9% in the haemorrhage group (mean follow-up 73.3 months) and 3.1% in the nonhaemorrhage group (mean follow-up 66.5 months) (P = 0.941). Preradiosurgical embolization increased the risk of haemorrhage for the nonhaemorrhage group (HR, 28.03; 95% CI, 1.08-6,759.64; P = 0.039), whereas it had no effect on the haemorrhage group. Latency period haemorrhage occurred in eight patients in the embolization group, but in no patient in the nonembolization group (P = 0.004).

11404708,[Radiosurgery for large cerebral arteriovenous malformations].,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Treatment of large cerebral arteriovenous malformations is a challenge for embolization, surgery and radiosurgery too. The purposes of this study is to review results of RS for these large cerebral arteriovenous malformations and to study recent methods which can allow to improve results. PATIENTS: and method. From our series, 112 patients had cerebral arteriovenous malformations higher than 30 mm or 10 cc at time of the radiosurgery. Revelation mode was hemorrhage in 47%, seizures in 42%, headaches in 16%, and progressive neurological deficits in 7%. Discovery was fortuitous in 2.7% of cases. Before radiosurgery, 57% were embolized, 5% were operated, 4.5% were reirradiated and 1.8% were operated and embolized. Distribution according to Spetzler & Martin's grade was following: 0% in grade I, 12% in grade II, 41% in grade III and 46% in grade IV. No patient was in grade V. RESULTS: Global obliteration rate was 39% for large cerebral arteriovenous malformations. In multivariate analysis, only recovering (positive correlation), and previous embolization (negative correlation) were correlated with obliteration rate.

17367056,Subtotal obliteration of cerebral arteriovenous malformations after gamma knife surgery.,"OBJECT: Subtotal obliteration of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) after Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) implies a complete angiographic disappearance of the AVM nidus but persistence of an early filling draining vein, indicating that residual shunting is still present; hence, per definition there is still a patent AVM and the risk of bleeding is not eliminated. The aim of this study was to determine the risk of hemorrhage for patients with subtotal obliteration of AVMs. METHODS: After GKS for cerebral AVMs, follow-up angiography demonstrated a subtotally obliterated lesion in 159 patients. Of these, in 16 patients a subtotally obliterated AVM developed after a second GKS was performed for the partially obliterated lesion. The mean age of these patients was 35.2 years at the time of the diagnosis of subtotally obliterated AVMs. The lesion volumes at the time of initial GKS treatment ranged from 0.1 to 11.5 cm3 (mean 2.5 cm3). The mean peripheral dose used in the 175 GKS treatments was 22.5 Gy (median 23 Gy, range 15-31 Gy). To achieve total obliteration of the AVM, 23 patients underwent a new GKS targeting the proximal end of the early filling vein. The mean peripheral dose given in these cases was 23 Gy (median 24, range 18-25 Gy). The incidence of subtotally obliterated AVMs was 7.6% from a total of 2093 AVMs treated and in which follow-up imaging was available. The diagnosis of subtotally obliterated AVMs was made a mean of 29.4 months (range 4-178 months) after GKS. The number of patient-years at risk (from the time of the diagnosis of subtotally obliterated AVMs until either the confirmation of a total obliteration of the lesion on angiography or the time of the latest follow-up angiographic study that still visualized the early filling vein) was a mean of 3.9 years, ranging from 0.5 to 13.5 years, and a total of 601 patient-years. There was no case of bleeding after the diagnosis of subtotally obliterated AVMs. Of 90 patients who did not undergo further treatment and in whom follow-up angiography studies were available, the same early filling veins still filled in 24 (26.7%), and the subtotally obliterated AVMs were subsequently obliterated in 66 patients (73.3%). In 19 patients who underwent repeated GKS for subtotally obliterated AVMs and in whom follow-up angiography studies were available, the AVMs were obliterated in 15 (78.9%) and remained patent in four (21.1%). CONCLUSIONS: The fact that none of the patients with subtotally obliterated AVMs suffered a rupture is not compatible with the assumption of an unchanged risk of hemorrhage for these lesions, and implies that the protection from rebleeding in patients with subtotal obliteration is significant. Subtotal obliteration does not necessarily seem to be a stage of an ongoing obliteration. At least in some cases it represents an end point of this process, with no subsequent obliteration occurring. This observation requires further confirmation by open-ended follow-up imaging.",2007 Mar,2007,Journal of neurosurgery,106,3,361-9,eng,False,10.3171/jns.2007.106.3.361,Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Cerebral Hemorrhage/*etiology;Child;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*complications/diagnostic;Male;Middle Aged;Radiography;*Radiosurgery;Retreatment;Retrospective Studies;Risk Assessment;Time Factors;Treatment Outcome,
12758114,Management of patients with brain arteriovenous malformations.,"Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the brain, which are probably genetically determined, are errors in the development of the vasculature that, together with the effects of blood flow, may lead to a focal arteriovenous shunt. Clinically, the adult patient may present with acute or chronic neurological symptoms-fixed or unstable-such as deficits, seizures or headache. Sometimes the lesion is an incidental finding. In about half of the patients, the revealing event is an intracranial haemorrhage. The prevalence of AVM in the western world is probably <0.01% and the detection rate is about one per 100,000 person-years. Most AVMs are revealed in patients 20-40 years of age. Therefore, the risk of developing neurological symptoms from an AVM, usually because of haemorrhage, increases with patient age. In the young adult population, AVMs are significant risk factors for hemorrhagic stroke. This risk increases with AVM volume and is higher in centrally located AVMs. Almost all patients with AVM are subjected to treatment, either by surgery, radiosurgery or embolisation, with the functional aim of reducing the risk of haemorrhage or to alleviate neurological symptoms with an acceptable treatment risk. Few neurocentres have physicians highly skilled in all treatment modalities. Therefore, the prescribed treatment may not be defined from an objective assessment of what is optimal for each individual patient, but rather from local expertise. In this context, more and better data about the natural history and the outcome of different treatments, as well as predictive models, would be valuable to help to optimise the management. Management strategies obviously differ according to local preferences, but results presented in the literature suggest the following strategy: (I) cortically located AVMs with a nidus volume <10 ml could be operated, with or without presurgical embolisation, unless there is a single feeder that can easily be catheterised and embolised for obliteration or other obvious target for embolisation, such as pseudoaneurysms or large fistulae; (II) centrally located AVMs with a nidus volume <10 ml should be treated by radiosurgery, unless suitable for embolisation as indicated above; (III) patients harbouring AVMs with a nidus volume >10 ml could benefit from targeted partial embolisation followed by radiosurgery or surgery, depending on the angioarchitecture; and (IV) AVMs >20 ml nidus volume usually have a high treatment risk with any treatment modality and are not obvious targets for treatment at all.",2003 Jun,2003,European journal of radiology,46,3,195-205,eng,False,S0720048X03000913;10.1016/s0720-048x(03)00091-3,Journal Article;Review,"Adult;Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology/mortality/prevention & control;Combined Modality Therapy;Embolization, Therapeutic;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Neurosurgical Procedures;Radiology, Interventional;Radiosurgery",
26316400,Prioritized Venous Coiling Facilitating Endovascular Treatment of Brain Arteriovenous Malformations with a Fistulous Component.,"BACKGROUND: Brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM) with a fistulous component presents a treatment challenge. The presence of the fistulous component may be related to either a complication from endovascular treatment, perioperative hemorrhagic events during surgical resection, or incomplete obliteration after radiosurgery. CASE DESCRIPTION: From December 2010 to May 2014, 7 consecutive patients (3 men, 4 women, average age, 28.7 years; age range, 11 months to 67 years) with AVMs with a high-flow fistulous component were treated at our institute with venous coiling before transarterial liquid embolization. One AVM was grade I based on the Spetzler-Martin grading system, 1 was grade II, 3 were grade III, and 2 were grade IV. The nidus size ranged from 1.7 to 6.0 cm. Four patients had pure fistulous-type lesions, and 3 had lesions of the mixed fistulous-plexiform type. All AVMs shared a common feature of a high-flow fistulous component with a large venous pouch emerging from the nidus. After endovascular embolization of the AVMs, 3 patients had complete occlusion, 3 patients had near-complete occlusion, and 1 patient had significant reduction in volume. There was no immediate complication after embolization, but 1 patient experienced delayed hemorrhage 3 days after the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Prioritized transarterial venous coiling is feasible for the embolization of AVMs with a high-flow fistulous component and the procedure had an acceptable complication rate.",2015 Dec,2015,World neurosurgery,84,6,1857-63,eng,False,S1878-8750(15)01029-3;10.1016/j.wneu.2015.08.014;S1878-8750(15)01029-3;10.1016/j.wneu.2015.08.014,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Arteriovenous Fistula/*diagnosis;Cerebral Angiography;Child;Child, Preschool;Embolization, Therapeutic/*methods;Endovascular Procedures/*methods;Feasibility Studies;Female;Humans;Infant;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*pathology/surgery/*therapy;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery;Severity of Illness Index;Treatment Outcome",Arteriovenous malformation;Brain;Endovascular treatment;Fistulous component;Prioritized venous coiling
25839923,The predictive value of magnetic resonance imaging in evaluating intracranial arteriovenous malformation obliteration after stereotactic radiosurgery.,"OBJECT: The current gold standard for diagnosing arteriovenous malformation (AVM) and assessing its obliteration after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Recently, MRI and MR angiography (MRA) have become increasingly popular imaging modalities for the follow-up of patients with an AVM because of their convenient setup and noninvasiveness. In this study, the authors assessed the sensitivity and specificity of MRI/MRA in evaluating AVM nidus obliteration as assessed by DSA. METHODS: The authors study a consecutive series of 136 patients who underwent SRS between January 2000 and December 2012 and who underwent regular clinical examinations, several MRI studies, and at least 1 post-SRS DSA follow- up evaluation at the University of Virginia. The average follow-up time was 47.3 months (range 10.1-165.2 months). Two blinded observers were enrolled to interpret the results of MRI/MRA compared with those of DSA. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for the obliteration of AVM were reported. RESULTS: On the basis of DSA, 73 patients (53.7%) achieved final angiographic obliteration in a median of 28.8 months. The sensitivity (the probability of finding obliteration on MRI/MRA among those for whom complete obliteration was shown on DSA) was 84.9% for one observer (Observer 1) and 76.7% for the other (Observer 2). The specificity was 88.9% and 95.2%, respectively. The false-negative interpretations were significantly related to the presence of draining veins, perinidal edema on T2-weighted images, and the interval between the MRI/MRA and DSA studies. CONCLUSIONS: MRI/MRA predicted AVM obliteration after SRS in most patients and can be used in their follow-up. However, because the specificity of MRI/MRA is not perfect, DSA should still be performed to confirm AVM nidus obliteration after SRS.",2015 Jul,2015,Journal of neurosurgery,123,1,136-44,eng,False,10.3171/2014.10.JNS141565;10.3171/2014.10.JNS141565,Evaluation Study;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Brain/blood supply/diagnostic imaging/pathology;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/pathology/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Angiography/*methods;Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods;Male;Middle Aged;Predictive Value of Tests;Radiography;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Sensitivity and Specificity;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",AVM = arteriovenous malformation;DSA = digital subtraction angiography;FSE = fast spin echo;GKS = Gamma Knife surgery;Gamma Knife;MRA = MR angiography;MRI;ROC = receiver operating characteristic;SRS = stereotactic radiosurgery;T1WI = T1-weighted imaging;T2WI = T2-weighted imaging;TOF = time of flight;arteriovenous malformation;digital subtraction angiography;obliteration;stereotactic radiosurgery;vascular disorders
32252098,High-Flow Vascular Malformations in Children.,"Children can have a variety of intracranial vascular anomalies ranging from small and incidental with no clinical consequences to complex lesions that can cause substantial neurologic deficits, heart failure, or profoundly affect development. In contrast to high-flow lesions with direct arterial-to-venous shunts, low-flow lesions such as cavernous malformations are associated with a lower likelihood of substantial hemorrhage, and a more benign course. Management of vascular anomalies in children has to incorporate an understanding of how treatment strategies may affect the normal development of the central nervous system.

29192860,Delayed cyst formation after stereotactic radiosurgery for brain arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVE: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a commonly employed treatment modality for brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). However, due to the low frequency of delayed cyst formation after AVM SRS, as well as the prolonged time interval between treatment and its occurrence, the characteristics of post-SRS cyst formation are not well defined. Therefore, the aims of this retrospective cohort study are to determine the rate of cyst formation after SRS for AVMs, identify predictive factors, and evaluate the clinical sequelae of post-SRS cysts. METHODS: The authors analyzed an SRS database for AVM patients who underwent SRS at the University of Virginia and identified those who developed post-SRS cysts. Statistical analyses were performed to determine predictors of post-SRS cyst formation and the effect of cyst formation on new or worsening seizures after SRS. RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 1159 AVM patients treated with SRS; cyst formation occurred in 17 patients (post-SRS cyst rate of 1.5%). Compared with patients who did not develop post-SRS cysts, those with cyst formation were treated with a greater number of radiosurgical isocenters (mean 3.8 vs 2.8, p = 0.047), had a longer follow-up (mean 132 vs 71 months, p < 0.001), were more likely to develop radiological radiation-induced changes (RIC) (64.7% vs 36.1%, p = 0.021), and had a longer duration of RIC (57 vs 21 months, p < 0.001). A higher number of isocenters (p = 0.014), radiological RIC (p = 0.002), and longer follow-up (p = 0.034) were found to be independent predictors of post-SRS cyst formation in the multivariate analysis. There was a trend toward a significant association between cyst formation and new or worsening seizures in univariate analysis (p = 0.054). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with greater nidal complexity appear to be more prone to post-SRS cyst formation. The findings of this study emphasize the importance of long-term follow-up for patients who have undergone AVM SRS, even after nidal obliteration is achieved.

23615081,Volumetric analysis of intracranial arteriovenous malformations contoured for CyberKnife radiosurgery with 3-dimensional rotational angiography vs computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging.,"BACKGROUND: Accurate target delineation has significant impact on brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM) obliteration, treatment success, and potential complications of stereotactic radiosurgery. OBJECTIVE: We compare the nidal contouring of AVMs using fused images of contrasted computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with matched images of 3-dimensional (3-D) cerebral angiography for CyberKnife radiosurgery (CKRS) treatment planning. METHODS: Between May 2009 and April 2012, 3-D cerebral angiography was integrated into CKRS target planning for 30 consecutive patients. The AVM nidal target volumes were delineated using fused CT and MRI scans vs fused CT, MRI, and 3-D cerebral angiography for each patient. RESULTS: The mean volume of the AVM nidus contoured with the addition of 3-D cerebral angiography to the CT/MRI fusion (9.09 cm(3), 95% confidence interval: 5.39 cm(3)-12.8 cm(3)) was statistically smaller than the mean volume contoured with CT/MRI fused scans alone (14.1 cm(3), 95% confidence interval: 9.16 cm(3)-19.1 cm(3)), with a mean volume difference of δ = 5.01 cm(3) (P = .001). Diffuse AVM nidus was associated with larger mean volume differences compared with a compact nidus (δ = 6.51 vs 2.11 cm(3), P = .02). The mean volume difference was not statistically associated with the patient's sex (male δ = 5.61, female δ = 5.06, P = .84), previous hemorrhage status (yes δ = 5.69, no δ = 5.23, P = .86), or previous embolization status (yes δ = 6.80, no δ = 5.95, P = .11).

11702882,Intractable epilepsy following radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformation.,"Radiosurgery is often used to treat arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) located in deep brain locations. Most of these procedures are successful not only in obliterating the AVM but also in decreasing the frequency and severity of associated seizures. Although radiosurgery is occasionally associated with the development of easy-to-control seizures immediately postoperatively, there have been no reports of intractable epilepsy developing after radiosurgery. In this report, however, a case is presented in which a patient underwent gamma knife surgery (GKS) for an AVM, after which intractable epilepsy and mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) gradually developed. A 37-year-old right-handed woman underwent GKS for a right mesial parietotemporooccipital AVM. One year later, the AVM had reduced in size, but the patient began to experience complex partial seizures (CPSs). These CPSs initially occurred at a frequency of one per month, but 6 months later they were occurring every other week. She also started having secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCSs) once per month. Over the next year the frequency of her seizures gradually increased to several CPSs per day and two to three GTCSs per week, despite treatment with various combinations of antiepileptic drugs. By this time her AVM had decreased to one half of its original size. Video-electroencephalography monitoring demonstrated that both the CPSs and GTCSs were arising from the right posterior quadrant. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed not only the presence of the right-sided AVM, but also right-sided MTS. The patient underwent surgical resection of the AVM and right temporal lobectomy. She has been free from seizure for longer than 1 year.

27153378,Long-term hemorrhagic risk in pediatric patients with arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVE Compared with the general population, the specific natural history of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in pediatric patients is less well understood. Furthermore, few pediatric studies have compared posttreatment hemorrhagic risk and functional outcome across different treatment modalities. The objective of this study was to elucidate these points. METHODS The authors retrospectively reviewed all pediatric patients with AVMs evaluated at their institution between 1990 and 2013. The AVM natural history was represented by hemorrhagic risk during the observation period. For treated patients, the observation period was defined as the interval between diagnosis and treatment. Posttreatment hemorrhagic risk and functional outcomes were also assessed. RESULTS A total of 124 pediatric patients with AVMs were evaluated, and 90 patients (72.6%) were retained through follow-up. The average patient age was 13.3 ± 3.8 years, with a mean follow-up period of 9.95 years. The overall AVM obliteration rate was 59.7%. Radiosurgery had an obliteration rate of 49.0%. Thirteen patients were managed conservatively. Four patients under observation hemorrhaged during a total interval of 429.4 patient-years, translating to an annual risk of 0.9%. Posttreatment hemorrhagic risk by treatment modalities were categorized as follows: surgery ± embolization (0.0%), radiosurgery ± embolization (0.8%), embolization alone (2.8%), surgery + radiosurgery ± embolization (3.5%), and observation (0.8%). A significantly higher risk of posttreatment hemorrhage was observed for patients with hemorrhagic presentation (p = 0.043) in multivariate analysis. Seizure presentation, frontal lobe location, nonheadache presentation, and treatment modality were significantly associated with increased risk of poor functional outcomes. CONCLUSIONS In this study of pediatric patients with AVMs, the natural history of hemorrhage was relatively low at 0.9%. Resection remained the optimal management for hemorrhage control and functional outcome perseverance in these pediatric patients with AVMs. AVM obliteration is a valid treatment goal, especially for patients with ruptured presentation, to prevent further hemorrhages later in life.",2016 Sep,2016,Journal of neurosurgery.

18503359,Radiosurgery of isolated cerebral vessels following administration of paclitaxel in the rat.,"OBJECT: Progressive obliteration occurs in arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) after radiosurgery; however, the risk of hemorrhage remains until the obliteration process is complete. The authors sought to enhance the radiation effect and reduce the risk of hemorrhage by facilitating faster vessel obliteration. To that end, a combination of a lower radiation dose with the addition of a radiosensitizing agent was compared with the effect of a higher radiation dose alone. METHODS: Using a method described by Mulvany and Halpern, isometric myography measurements were made on isolated rat middle cerebral artery specimens. The vessels were treated with 200 Gy, 80 Gy, 50 Gy, 25 Gy, 20 Gy, or 15 Gy by using Gamma Knife surgery. Taxol (paclitaxel 3 mg/kg/body weight) was administered intravenously to the animals. Survival times posttreatment were 24 hours, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 12 months, or 18 months. After dissection, the middle cerebral arteries were mounted on a small-vessel myograph, and contraction and relaxation studies were performed. In a second series of experiments these results were validated in human fibroblast culture. When the cultures were 75 to 80% colonized, the samples were treated in vitro with 60Co gamma radiation in similar doses with or without paclitaxel. CONCLUSIONS: Constriction responses were generally decreased in the paclitaxel-treated vessels. Differences were significant at 6 weeks (p < 0.05) and at 1 year (p < 0.05). After 1 year, in the paclitaxel-treated groups vascular reactivity was completely abolished in vessels receiving 50 Gy. In comparison, it took 6 months longer (18 months) for this reaction to be abolished in vessels without paclitaxel treatment. In tissue cultures Giemsa staining and immunohistochemical reactions for p53, Ki-67, CD-34, and SMA antigens revealed marked fibroblast hypertrophy in all of the paclitaxel-treated groups. Paclitaxel-treated vessels demonstrated decreased reactivity at significantly earlier stages than vessels that had not been treated. It would appear that paclitaxel causes acceleration in the time course of the late biological effect of gamma radiation. This beneficial effect could be used in Gamma Knife surgery in patients with AVMs, thus reducing the risk of posttreatment hemorrhage.",2006 Dec,2006,Journal of neurosurgery,105 Suppl,,214-21,eng,False,10.3171/sup.2006.105.7.214,Journal Article,"Animals;Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology;*Cavernous Sinus;Cell Culture Techniques;Gamma Rays;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/pathology/*therapy;Male;Middle Cerebral Artery/drug effects/*radiation effects/surgery;Paclitaxel/*pharmacology;*Radiosurgery;Rats;Rats, Wistar",

17219842,Gamma knife surgery-induced meningioma. Report of two cases and review of the literature.,"Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) is a minimally invasive neurosurgical technique. During the past 30 years, radiosurgery has been performed for a number of intracranial disorders with a generally low incidence of side effects. Although radiation-induced neoplasia following radiotherapy is well documented, there are few reports of this complication following radiosurgery. The authors are engaged in an ongoing project in which they are studying the delayed adverse effects of radiosurgical changes in 2500 patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) treated within a 30-year period. The cases of 1333 patients treated by the senior author (L.S.) have been reviewed thus far. A subset of 288 patients in this group underwent neuroimaging and participated in clinical follow up for at least 10 years. The authors report two cases of radiosurgically induced neoplasia. In both cases the patient was treated with GKS for an AVM. Longer than 10 years after GKS, each of the patients was found to have an incidental, uniformly enhancing, dura-based mass lesion near the site of the AVM. These lesions displayed the imaging characteristics of a meningioma. Because in both cases the lesion has displayed no evidence of a mass effect, they continue to be followed using serial neuroimaging. These are the fifth and sixth cases meeting the criteria for radiation-induced neoplasms defined by Cahan, et al., in 1998. Although radiosurgery is generally considered quite safe, the incidence of radiation-induced neoplasms is not known. These cases and the few others detailed in the literature emphasize the need for long-term neurosurgical follow-up review in patients after radiosurgery.",2006 Aug,2006,Journal of neurosurgery,105,2,325-9,eng,False,10.3171/jns.2006.105.2.325,Case Reports;Journal Article;Review,"Adolescent;Adult;Child;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Meningeal Neoplasms/diagnosis/*etiology;Meningioma/diagnosis/*etiology;Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/diagnosis/*etiology;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects;Reoperation",
12405363,Retrospective analysis of a 10-year experience of stereotactic radio surgery for arteriovenous malformations in children and adolescents.,"OBJECT: To obtain information essential to the decision to perform radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in children and adolescents, the authors retrospectively analyzed their experience with gamma knife surgery for AVMs in 100 patients ranging in age from 4 to 19 years. METHODS: Follow-up periods ranged from 6 to 124 months (median 71 months), and the actuarial obliteration rates demonstrated by angiography were 84.1, 89.4, and 94.7% at 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively. Factors associated with better obliteration rates in univariate analysis included the following: a patient age of 12 years or younger; a mean nidus diameter of 2 cm or less; a nidus volume of 3.8 cm3 or less; a maximum diameter of the nidus less than 3 cm; and a Spetzler-Martin grade of III or less. Radiation-induced neuropathy was seen in four patients, and the risk factors were considered to be a nidus in the brainstem and a maximum radiation dose greater than 40 Gy. Hemorrhage developed during the latency interval in four patients, and one patient with a cerebellar AVM died of the hemorrhage. The annual bleeding rate was 1.5%. Feeding arteries located in the posterior cranial fossa and an AVM nidus located in the cerebellum were significantly associated with the risk of hemorrhage. After angiographically verified obliteration of the nidus, 51 patients continued to be observed from 1 to 110 months (median 67 months); hemorrhage developed in one patient 38 months after nidus obliteration. CONCLUSIONS: Radiosurgery is an acceptable treatment for small AVMs in children and adolescents in whom a higher obliteration rate can be achieved with lower risks of interval hemorrhage compared with the reported results in the general population. Careful follow-up observation seems to be required, however, even after angiographically verified obliteration.",2002 Oct,2002,Journal of neurosurgery,97,4,779-84,eng,False,10.3171/jns.2002.97.4.0779,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Cerebral Angiography;Cerebral Hemorrhage/epidemiology;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/*surgery;Male;Postoperative Complications/epidemiology;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Risk Factors;Treatment Outcome",

METHODS: The outcomes of 45 patients who underwent GKRS for C-AVMs at our institution were retrospectively analyzed. Event-free survival was defined as free from any neurologic deficits caused by AVMs or adverse phenomena from the treatment. RESULTS: The median age and follow-up were 41 years (range, 6-77 years) and 120 months (range, 5-291 months), respectively. The median volume and Pollock-Flickinger radiosurgical AVM score were 1.3 cm(3) (range, 0.1-8.3 cm(3)) and 1.26 (range, 0.5-2.06), respectively. Actuarial obliteration rates were 46%, 75%, and 90% at 3, 5, and 6 years, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that the maximal diameter ≤15 mm (P = 0.021) and margin dose >20 Gy (P = 0.0008) were significantly associated with better obliteration. Four patients experienced posttreatment hemorrhages, and annual hemorrhage rates were 1.9% and 0.30% before and after obliteration, respectively. One patient died because of hemorrhage, whereas the other 3 patients spontaneously recovered. Perifocal edema was confirmed in 8 (16%); however, no symptomatic edema was observed. Overall, neurologic deteriorations were noted in 4 patients; 3 were because of posttreatment hemorrhage, and 1 was because of pretreatment angiography. The event-free survival rates were 96%, 93%, and 93% at 4, 10, and 15 years, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: GKRS is a reasonable intervention for C-AVMs. Symptomatic complications are rare, and the long-term outcomes are favorable.",2017 Feb,2017,World neurosurgery,98,,314-322,eng,False,S1878-8750(16)31138-X;10.1016/j.wneu.2016.10.137;S1878-8750(16)31138-X;10.1016/j.wneu.2016.10.137,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Angiography, Digital Subtraction/trends;Arteriovenous Fistula/*diagnostic imaging/*radiotherapy;Cerebellum/*diagnostic imaging;Child;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnostic imaging/*radiotherapy;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/*trends;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",Arteriovenous malformation;Cerebellum;Gamma Knife;Intracranial hemorrhage;Posterior fossa;Stereotactic radiosurgery
27430414,Delayed cyst formations and/or expanding hematomas developing after Gamma Knife surgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"The authors retrospectively analyzed cyst formations and expanding haematomas (EHs) that developed after Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) for arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), and evaluated the treatment results of these lesions. Cyst formations and/or EHs which developed after GKS for AVMs were identified in 20 patients (5.0%) out of 404 patients who underwent this procedure. There were nine patients with cyst formations, two with EHs and nine with cyst formations with EHs. These lesions developed between 36 and 192months (median 99months) after GKS. The median nidus volume was 4.7ml (range, 1.8-14.2ml) and the median prescribed margin dose was 20Gy (range, 15-23Gy). The multivariate analysis showed no correlation between the appearance of cyst formations and/or EHs and the patients' age, sex, nidus volume, margin dose, repeated GKS, nidus obliteration, pre-GKS embolization and prior hemorrhage. Surgical treatment was required in nine patients. Eight patients had total removal of the angiomatous lesions (EHs or nodular lesions that were detected as enhancement part on MRI) via a craniotomy and one had a cyst aspiration. There was no recurrence of the lesions in all the patients that underwent a craniotomy. In the patient treated with a cyst aspiration, regrowth of the cyst formation occurred. Surgical treatment should be considered for symptomatic lesions and we recommend total removal of the angiomatous lesions to achieve a complete cure.",2016 Nov,2016,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society,33,,96-99,eng,False,S0967-5868(16)30351-4;10.1016/j.jocn.2016.01.044;S0967-5868(16)30351-4;10.1016/j.jocn.2016.01.044,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Central Nervous System Cysts/diagnostic imaging/*pathology;Child;Craniotomy/adverse effects;Embolization, Therapeutic;Female;Hematoma/diagnostic imaging/*pathology;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Margins of Excision;Middle Aged;Postoperative Complications/diagnostic imaging/epidemiology/therapy;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects;Retrospective Studies;Suction;Young Adult",Cerebral arteriovenous malformation;Cyst formation;Expanding hematoma;Gamma Knife surgery

23287780,The risk of stroke or clinical impairment after stereotactic radiosurgery for ARUBA-eligible patients.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The best management of patients with unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVM) is controversial. In this study, we analyzed the stroke rate and functional outcomes of patients having stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for unruptured BAVM using the same eligibility criteria and primary end points as the ARUBA trial. METHODS: Retrospective observational study of 174 ARUBA-eligible patients having SRS from 1990 to 2005. RESULTS: The median follow-up after SRS was 64 months. Fifteen patients (8.7%) had a hemorrhagic stroke at a median of 21 months after SRS. Six patients (3.5%) had a focal neurological deficit and 4 patients died (2.3%). The risk of stroke or death was 10.3% at 5 years and 11.5% at 10 years. Twelve additional patients (6.9%) had a focal neurological deficit from either radiation-related complications (n=7) or subsequent resection (n=5). The risk of patients' having clinical impairment (modified Rankin Score ≥ 2) was 8.4% at 5 years and 12.0% at 10 years. Increasing BAVM volume was associated with both stroke or death (hazard ratio=1.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-1.11; P=0.04) and clinical impairment (hazard ratio=1.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.09; P=0.01). The 10-year risk of stroke or death and clinical impairment for patients with BAVM ≤ 5.6 cm(3) was 5% and 4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The observed risk of stroke or death after SRS was approximately 2% per year for the first 5 years after SRS, declining to 0.2% annually for years 6 to 10. Patients with small volume BAVM may benefit from SRS compared with the natural history of unruptured BAVM over the planned follow-up interval of the ARUBA trial (5-10 years).",2013 Feb,2013,Stroke,44,2,437-41,eng,False,10.1161/STROKEAHA.112.670232;STROKEAHA.112.670232;10.1161/STROKEAHA.112.670232,Journal Article,Adult;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*epidemiology/mortality/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Prospective Studies;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Retrospective Studies;Risk Factors;Stroke/diagnosis/*epidemiology/mortality;Survival Rate/trends;Treatment Outcome,

Complete obliteration of nidus was confirmed 20 months after radiosurgery. However, a hypointense mass on T(2)-weighted magnetic resonance imaging developed in the area adjacent to the nidus after approximately 80 months. The mass gradually increased in size and induced severe perifocal edema over 2 years. The mass was successfully excised. Histological examination revealed that the mass consisted of dilated sinusoid vessels attached to the hematoma capsule, and the hematoma included clots in various stages of organization encapsulated by dense collagenous tissue. The histological diagnosis was cavernoma. De novo formation of cavernoma is well known to occur after radiation surgery for intracranial tumor, especially in pediatric patients, but is rare in adults. Based on the radiological and histological findings in the present case, the radiation-induced cavernoma underwent repeated bleedings resulting in chronic encapsulated expanding hematoma.",2008 Sep,2008,Neurologia medico-chirurgica,48,9,397-400,eng,False,JST.JSTAGE/nmc/48.397;10.2176/nmc.48.397,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Caudate Nucleus/blood supply/surgery;Hemangioma, Cavernous, Central Nervous System/*etiology/pathology/surgery;Hematoma/etiology/pathology;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/pathology/*surgery;Intracranial Hemorrhages/*etiology/pathology;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects;Stereotaxic Techniques/adverse effects;Treatment Outcome",
26246089,The clinical characteristics and treatment of cerebral AVM in pregnancy.,"Cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in pregnancy is a complex situation and there is no agreement on its hemorrhage risk and treatment. Although studies on bleeding risk of cerebral AVMs in pregnancy are very few, and they provide different results, pregnancy will increase the hemorrhagic risk of AVM and ruptured cerebral AVM in pregnancy should be actively treated. After intracranial hemorrhage, cerebral angiography should be performed for pregnant women shielded correctly. Cerebral angiography could clearly demonstrate the characteristics of cerebral AVM. Results from the literature show that the radiation dose of endovascular and stereotactic radiotherapy for cerebral AVM in pregnancy was below the safety value and was safe. For an unruptured AVM in pregnancy, if there are no bleeding factors, e.g. no coexisting aneurysm, smooth venous drainage, no venous ectasia, or high risk of treatment, then it should be observed conservatively.",2015 Jun,2015,The neuroradiology journal,28,3,234-7,eng,False,10.1177/1971400915589692;28/3/234;10.1177_1971400915589692;10.1177/1971400915589692,Journal Article;Review,"Cerebral Angiography;Decompression, Surgical/*methods;Embolization, Therapeutic/*methods;Encephalocele/diagnosis/etiology/*surgery;Endovascular Procedures;Female;Hematoma/diagnosis/etiology/*surgery;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/diagnosis/*surgery;Intracranial Hemorrhages/diagnosis/etiology/*surgery;Pregnancy;Pregnancy Complications, Cardiovascular/diagnosis/*surgery;Radiosurgery/*methods",cerebral arteriovenous malformation;pregnancy;treatment
17966240,Information on heavy equipments and facilities in Belgium: gamma-knife.,"PURPOSE: To explain the principles and indications of gamma knife radiosurgery and to illustrate the correlated neuroimaging features. METHODS AND MATERIAL: Between December 1999 and July 2007, 1620 patients were treated by GK for a large variety of indications (metastasis 26%, vascular malformations 7%, trigeminal neuralgia 14%, pituitary adenoma 3%, primary CNS tumour 8%, other tumours 6%, vestibular schwannoma 19%, meningioma 17%, functional disorders <1%). The patients benefited from MRI follow-ups. RESULTS: MRI is the imaging technique of choice for Gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) in almost all indications. Computed Tomography, Digital Subtraction Angiography and Positron Emission Tomography have an additional role in some indications. Significant MRI data is illustrated in most indications. Evaluation of the treatment is mainly performed using MRI follow-up studies. The main features of these MRI follow-ups are described. Stabilisation or shrinking of the lesions volumes was generally observed. T2 relaxation times were also modified in and around the treated target areas, in patients responding to treatment and without any symptomatic complications. Modifications in contrast uptake were also observed in those patients. A few patients presented symptomatic complications associated with T2 signal anomalies. The interpretation of those modifications is discussed. CONCLUSION: MRI is the method of choice for GKRS planning in most indications. Imaging changes after radiosurgery provide the best quality control available to assess the response to radiosurgical treatment and to identify and monitor potential complications.",2007 Jul-Aug,2007,JBR-BTR : organe de la Societe royale belge de radiologie (SRBR) = orgaan van de,90,4,252-7,eng,False,,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Adult;Angiography, Digital Subtraction;Astrocytoma/surgery;Belgium;Brain Diseases/surgery;Brain Neoplasms/surgery;*Diagnostic Imaging;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Movement Disorders/surgery;Neuroma, Acoustic/surgery;Parkinson Disease/surgery;Positron-Emission Tomography;Prolactinoma/surgery;Radiosurgery/*instrumentation/methods;Tomography, X-Ray Computed;Treatment Outcome;Trigeminal Neuralgia/surgery",
30500592,Venous Stenosis and Hemorrhage After Radiosurgery for Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformations.,"BACKGROUND: The risk of hemorrhage remains after radiosurgery for patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), especially during the latency period. The effect of venous outflow stenosis on postradiosurgery AVM hemorrhage has been understudied. The present study sought to clarify the effect of venous stenosis on postradiation hemorrhage. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients with AVM seen at our institution from 1990 to 2015. Patients who had undergone radiosurgery were included, and those without sufficient data were excluded. We performed multivariable Cox regression to evaluate the predictors of postradiosurgery hemorrhage, with specific emphasis on venous stenosis. Patients were censored from the first radiosurgery to hemorrhage or the last follow-up visit. The baseline and angiographic characteristics were compared between those with venous stenosis and those without to address potential confounders. RESULTS: The present study included 240 patients, of whom 29 (12.1%) had venous stenosis. The venous stenosis cohort included more patients with venous varices (P = 0.009) and fewer with deep venous drainage (P = 0.048) compared with those without venous stenosis. Most patients had grade III or higher AVMs (63.2%), with an obliteration rate of 32.9%. In an all-inclusive multivariable Cox regression, hemorrhage risk was associated with venous stenosis (hazard ratio [HR], 3.70; P = 0.034), age (HR, 1.05; P = 0.002), AVM volume (HR, 1.04; P = 0.004), and hemorrhage before treatment (HR, 4.11; P = 0.014). Male gender was protective (HR, 0.31; P = 0.036) against hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: We identified statistically significant risk factors for postradiosurgery AVM hemorrhage, which included advanced age, female gender, the presence of venous stenosis, a larger AVM volume, and previous hemorrhage. We recommend cautious selection of patients for radiosurgery with close follow-up after treatment, especially for patients with these risk factors.",2019 Feb,2019,World neurosurgery,122,,e1615-e1625,eng,False,S1878-8750(18)32752-9;10.1016/j.wneu.2018.11.193;S1878-8750(18)32752-9;10.1016/j.wneu.2018.11.193,Journal Article,"Adult;Cerebral Hemorrhage/*epidemiology/*etiology;Constriction, Pathologic/epidemiology/etiology;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/epidemiology/*radiotherapy;Male;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Risk Factors",Arteriovenous malformations;Hemorrhage;Radiosurgery;Venous stenosis

27349396,Drainage Vein Induced Hydrocephalus Caused by an Unruptured Arteriovenous Malformation in an Adult Presenting with Visual Loss.,"Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) commonly present with seizures and hemorrhage. Hydrocephalus associated with an unruptured AVM in an adult patient is exceedingly rare. A 37-year-old male patient presented with total visual loss in his right eye and severe impairment in his left eye. His evaluation showed an unruptured right frontal AVM and bilaterally dilated lateral ventricles. The major draining vein of the AVM was obstructing the third ventricle. An urgent external ventricular drainage was used as the first line intervention and followed with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt two days later. His definitive treatment for AVM was staged stereotactic gamma-knife radiosurgery. Unruptured AVMs in adult patients may rarely cause hydrocephalus. Visual loss caused by such a hydrocephalus has not been reported before. Both communicating and non-communicating type hydrocephalus can be seen with unruptured AVMs, and have different pathophysiological mechanisms. Our patient was treated with ventriculoperitoneal shunting, and visual examination remained unchanged after the operation. Visual loss caused by hydrocephalus associated with an unruptured AVM in an adult patient has not been reported before. It may indicate an association of different pathophysiological mechanisms.

22631689,Stereotactic radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations after embolization: a case-control study.,"OBJECT: In this paper the authors' goal was to define the long-term benefits and risks of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) who underwent prior embolization. METHODS: Between 1987 and 2006, the authors performed Gamma Knife surgery in 996 patients with brain AVMs; 120 patients underwent embolization followed by SRS. In this series, 64 patients (53%) had at least one prior hemorrhage. The median number of embolizations varied from 1 to 5. The median target volume was 6.6 cm(3) (range 0.2-26.3 cm(3)). The median margin dose was 18 Gy (range 13.5-25 Gy). RESULTS: After embolization, 25 patients (21%) developed symptomatic neurological deficits. The overall rates of total obliteration documented by either angiography or MRI were 35%, 53%, 55%, and 59% at 3, 4, 5, and 10 years, respectively. Factors associated with a higher rate of AVM obliteration were smaller target volume, smaller maximum diameter, higher margin dose, timing of embolization during the most recent 10-year period (1997-2006), and lower Pollock-Flickinger score. Nine patients (8%) had a hemorrhage during the latency period, and 7 patients died of hemorrhage. The actuarial rates of AVM hemorrhage after SRS were 0.8%, 3.5%, 5.4%, 7.7%, and 7.7% at 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 years, respectively. The overall annual hemorrhage rate was 2.7%. Factors associated with a higher risk of hemorrhage after SRS were a larger target volume and a larger number of prior hemorrhages. Permanent neurological deficits due to adverse radiation effects (AREs) developed in 3 patients (2.5%) after SRS, and 1 patient had delayed cyst formation 210 months after SRS. No patient died of AREs. A larger 12-Gy volume was associated with higher risk of symptomatic AREs. Using a case-control matched approach, the authors found that patients who underwent embolization prior to SRS had a lower rate of total obliteration (p = 0.028) than patients who had not undergone embolization. CONCLUSIONS: In this 20-year experience, the authors found that prior embolization reduced the rate of total obliteration after SRS, and that the risks of hemorrhage during the latency period were not affected by prior embolization. For patients who underwent embolization to volumes smaller than 8 cm(3), success was significantly improved. A margin dose of 18 Gy or more also improved success. In the future, the role of embolization after SRS should be explored.",2012 Aug,2012,Journal of neurosurgery,117,2,265-75,eng,True,10.3171/2012.4.JNS111935;10.3171/2012.4.JNS111935,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Case-Control Studies;Cerebral Angiography;Child;Child, Preschool;Combined Modality Therapy;*Embolization, Therapeutic;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*therapy;Intracranial Hemorrhages/etiology;Magnetic Resonance Angiography;Male;Middle Aged;Neurologic Examination;Postoperative Complications/etiology;*Radiosurgery;Retreatment;Treatment Failure;Young Adult",
36808403,Growth of Flow-Related Aneurysms Following Occlusion of Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformation.,"BACKGROUND: Flow-related aneurysms (FRAs) associated with cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) pose a significant therapeutic challenge. Both their natural history and management strategy are still unclear and underreported. FRAs generally increase the risk of brain hemorrhage. However, following AVM obliteration these vascular lesions are expected to disappear or remain stable. METHODS: We present two cases where growth of FRAs was detected following complete obliteration of an unruptured AVM. RESULTS: The first patient presented with proximal middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysm growth after spontaneous and asymptomatic thrombosis of the AVM. In our second case, a very small aneurysmal-like dilation located at the basilar apex enlarged to a saccular aneurysm following complete endovascular and radiosurgical obliteration of the AVM. CONCLUSION: The natural history of flow-related aneurysms is unpredictable. In the cases where these lesions are not managed first, there should be close follow-up. When aneurysm growth is evident, active management strategy seems mandatory.",2024 Sep,2024,"Journal of neurological surgery.

26702837,Recurrence of Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformations Following Resection in Adults: Does Preoperative Embolization Increase the Risk?,"BACKGROUND: Complete surgical resection of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), documented by postoperative angiography, is generally felt to represent cure, obviating the need for long-term follow-up imaging. Although AVM recurrence has been reported in the pediatric population, this phenomenon has only rarely been documented in adults. Recurrence after treatment solely with embolization, however, has been reported more frequently. Thus, patients undergoing multimodal therapy with surgery following preoperative embolization may also be at higher risk for recurrence. OBJECTIVE: To determine if preoperative embolization contributes to recurrences of AVMs after complete surgical resection. METHODS: A retrospective study of patients undergoing AVM resection was performed. Those with complete surgical AVM resection, confirmed by negative early postoperative cerebral angiography and with available follow-up angiographic imaging >6 months postoperatively were included. RESULTS: Two hundred three patients underwent AVM resection between 1995 and 2012. Seventy-two patients met eligibility criteria. There were 3 recurrences (4%). Deep venous drainage and diffuse type of AVM nidus were significantly associated with recurrence. Although preoperative embolization did not reach statistical significance as an independent risk factor, radiographic data supported its role in every case, with the site of recurrence correlating with deep regions of nidus previously obliterated by embolization. CONCLUSION: AVM recurrences in the adult population may have a multifactorial origin. Although deep venous drainage and diffuse nidus are clearly risk factors, preoperative embolization may also be a contributing factor with the potential for recurrence of unresected but embolized portions of the AVM. Follow-up angiography at 1 to 3 years appears to be warranted.",2016 Apr,2016,Neurosurgery,78,4,562-71,eng,False,10.1227/NEU.0000000000001191;10.1227/NEU.0000000000001191,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Adult;Cerebral Angiography;Combined Modality Therapy;Drainage;Embolization, Therapeutic/*adverse effects;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Neurosurgical Procedures/*methods;Radiosurgery;Recurrence;Retrospective Studies;Risk Factors;Treatment Outcome",
12468772,A population-based study of brain arteriovenous malformation: long-term treatment outcomes.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: By undertaking long-term follow-up of a functionally isolated population study group, we sought to achieve a true picture of intrinsic brain arteriovenous malformation (BAVM). We sought to assess the validity of earlier population-based series and to determine the effects of newer treatment methods on the overall morbidity and mortality of BAVM. METHODS: We excluded other intracranial vascular pathologies by defining criteria. By retrospective and prospective study, 240 patients with BAVM were followed for a mean of 10.11 years from first diagnosis. RESULTS: Death rates were as follows: all causes, 12.9%; all BAVM related, 8.75%; BAVM related during conservative management, 24.6%; and BAVM related during active management, 3.9% (P=0.031). Mean diagnosis-to-death interval was 10.6 years. Oxford neurological disability scale grades of 209 survivors (July 2001) were as follows: grades 0 to 2, 74.1%; grade 3, 17.2%; and grades 4 to 5, 9.5%. Death rates were higher for patients who had bled or suffered nonhemorrhagic neurological deficit at original presentation. Incidence of first-ever hemorrhage in untreated patients was as follows: 0 to 9 years, 4.6% (P=0.0035); 30 to 39 years, 21% (P=0.02); and 60 to 69 years, 40.0% (P=0.045). The first bleed was fatal in 4.6%. CONCLUSIONS: We find no evidence of a substantial undiagnosed reservoir of nonsymptomatic BAVM. All BAVM are potentially hazardous. The great majority of BAVM patients become symptomatic during the patient's lifetime, and the majority will bleed. The risk of first hemorrhage is lifelong and rises with age. Compared with earlier population-based series, our low overall patient mortality is predominantly due to higher proportions of active treatment in the 1980s and 1990s.",2002 Dec,2002,Stroke,33,12,2794-800,eng,False,10.1161/01.str.0000043674.99741.9b,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adult;Age Distribution;Aged;Cerebral Hemorrhage/*mortality;Child;Child, Preschool;Cohort Studies;Comorbidity;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Incidence;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Intracranial Arteriovenous;Male;Middle Aged;Neurosurgical Procedures/statistics & numerical data;Prevalence;Prospective Studies;Radiosurgery/statistics & numerical data;Reproducibility of Results;Retrospective Studies;Risk Assessment;Time;Treatment Outcome;Western Australia/epidemiology",
18518720,Multimodality treatment of posterior fossa arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECT: Posterior fossa arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are relatively uncommon and often difficult to treat. The authors present their experience with multimodality treatment of 76 posterior fossa AVMs, with an emphasis on Spetzler-Martin Grades III-V AVMs. METHODS: Seventy-six patients with posterior fossa AVMs treated with radiosurgery, surgery, and endovascular techniques were analyzed. RESULTS: Between 1982 and 2006, 36 patients with cerebellar AVMs, 33 with brainstem AVMs, and 7 with combined cerebellar-brainstem AVMs were treated. Natural history data were calculated for all 76 patients. The risk of hemorrhage from presentation until initial treatment was 8.4% per year, and it was 9.6% per year after treatment and before obliteration. Forty-eight patients had Grades III-V AVMs with a mean follow-up of 4.8 years (range 0.1-18.4 years, median 3.1 years). Fifty-two percent of patients with Grades III-V AVMs had complete obliteration at the last follow-up visit. Three (21.4%) of 14 patients were cured with a single radiosurgery treatment, and 4 (28.6%) of 14 with 1 or 2 radiosurgery treatments. Twenty-one (61.8%) of 34 patients were cured with multimodality treatment. The mean Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score after treatment was 3.8. Multivariate analysis performed in the 48 patients with Grades III-V AVMs showed radiosurgery alone to be a negative predictor of cure (p = 0.0047). Radiosurgery treatment alone was not a positive predictor of excellent clinical outcome (GOS Score 5; p > 0.05). Nine (18.8%) of 48 patients had major neurological complications related to treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Single-treatment radiosurgery has a low cure rate for posterior fossa Spetzler-Martin Grades III-V AVMs. Multimodality therapy nearly tripled this cure rate, with an acceptable risk of complications and excellent or good clinical outcomes in 81% of patients. Radiosurgery alone should be used for intrinsic brainstem AVMs, and multimodality treatment should be considered for all other posterior fossa AVMs.",2008 Jun,2008,Journal of neurosurgery,108,6,1152-61,eng,True,10.3171/JNS/2008/108/6/1152;10.3171/JNS/2008/108/6/1152,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adolescent;Adult;Aged;*Angioplasty;Arteriovenous Fistula/diagnosis/etiology/*therapy;Brain Stem/*blood supply;Child;Cohort Studies;Combined Modality Therapy;*Embolization, Therapeutic;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/classification/diagnosis/*therapy;Male;Middle Aged;Patient Selection;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome",
11597644,Venous malformation serving as the draining vein of an adjoining arteriovenous malformation. Case report and review of the literature.,"BACKGROUND: Widely accepted pathologic classification of venous malformations includes discrete venous, arteriovenous, capillary, and cavernous malformations, each with distinct pathological criteria for definition. Several authors have described mixed or transitional vascular malformations with pathological features of more than one type of malformation within the same lesion. We present a rare case of a venous malformation associated with an arteriovenous malformation (AVM). CASE DESCRIPTION: A 37-year-old woman presented with a loss of consciousness. Computed tomography showed an enlarged vein running along the lateral wall of the right lateral ventricle. A cerebral angiogram demonstrated an AVM and a venous malformation in the right hemisphere; the AVM and the venous malformation were located in proximity to each other with the AVM using the venous malformation as its draining vein. In this case, where an AVM used the venous malformation as the draining vein, only the AVM was treated by proton-beam radiosurgery. Follow-up magnetic resonance angiography demonstrated complete obliteration of the AVM with the venous malformation remaining unchanged. CONCLUSION: Arteriovenous shunting would have disturbed venous drainage resulting in the development of the venous malformation. Thus, in addition to demonstrating a rare coexistence of AVM and venous malformation, this case also offers a new insight into the pathogenesis of these vascular malformations.",2001 Sep,2001,Surgical neurology,56,3,170-4,eng,False,S0090-3019(01)00457-8;10.1016/s0090-3019(01)00457-8,Case Reports;Journal Article;Review,"Adult;Central Nervous System Vascular Malformations/*diagnosis/physiopathology;Cerebral Veins/*abnormalities/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology;Drainage;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnosis/physiopathology/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Angiography;Radiosurgery;Tomography, X-Ray Computed",
19940546,Radiation schedules in relation to obliteration and complications in hypofractionated conformal stereotactic radiotherapy of arteriovenous malformations.,"AIMS: The purpose of this investigation was to assess the obliteration rate and complications following different radiation schedules of hypofractionated conformal stereotactic radiotherapy for cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). METHODS: Twenty-five patients were treated with 35 Gy in 5 fractions, whereas 31 patients were treated with 30-32.5 Gy (mean: 31.6 +/- 0.23 Gy) in 5 fractions. A complete angiographic follow-up is available for 40 patients. RESULTS: Thirty-seven out of 40 patients (92.5%) have so far shown obliteration of their AVMs after a mean time of 3.2 +/- 0.26 years (range: 2-8 years). The mean AVM volume in these patients was 8.2 +/- 1.0 cm(3) (range: 1.5-29 cm(3)). There was a higher rate of obliteration (88%) in patients treated with 35 Gy compared to those treated with < 35 Gy (78%), even if this was not statistically significant. There was a significantly shorter time to obliteration in patients treated with 35 Gy. All patients who experienced symptomatic radionecrosis belonged to the group treated with 35 Gy. CONCLUSION: A radiation schedule of 35 Gy in 5 fractions may be more effective than a radiation schedule of <35 (30-32.5) Gy in obliterating AVMs. This may, however, be at the price of an increased risk of symptomatic radionecrosis.",2010,2010,Stereotactic and functional neurosurgery,88,1,24-8,eng,False,10.1159/000260076;000260076;10.1159/000260076,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Brain/pathology/*radiation effects;Cerebral Angiography;Chi-Square Distribution;Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Kaplan-Meier Estimate;Male;Middle Aged;Necrosis/etiology;Radiation Injuries/pathology;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects;Treatment Outcome",
30218805,Treatment of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformations: A Single-Center Experience of 86 Patients and a Critique of the A Randomized Trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformations (ARUBA) Trial.,"OBJECTIVE: The A Randomized Trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformations (ARUBA) trial has received fierce criticism, including considerable selection bias, poor generalizability, questionable clinical practices (only 15.8% underwent surgical resection, the gold standard for arteriovenous malformation [AVM] treatment), and short follow-up (33 months) for a disease process that carries a life-long risk. In this study, we sought to present our own experience treating unruptured brain AVMs to provide supporting evidence of the ARUBA trial criticism. METHODS: All cases of treated brain AVMs from 2004 to 2017 at our institution were retrospectively reviewed and included in the analysis if they met ARUBA trial inclusion criteria. The primary outcome was symptomatic stroke or death. Secondary outcomes included AVM obliteration, long-term clinical impairment (modified Rankin Scale score >1), and new major or minor postoperative deficit. RESULTS: Of the 245 reviewed cases, 86 met the ARUBA trial criteria. Treatment included microsurgical resection alone (2.3%), preoperative embolization followed by microsurgical resection (62.8%), stereotactic radiosurgery alone (10.5%), embolization followed by stereotactic radiosurgery (15.1%), and embolization alone (9.3%). The primary outcome was met in 8.3%, new perioperative major and minor complications occurred in 5.8% and 12.8%, and long-term clinical impairment in 4.5%. AVM obliteration was observed in 92.4% overall and in 100% of patients who underwent surgical resection. CONCLUSIONS: The criticism of the ARUBA trial is warranted, as our study found that treatment of unruptured brain AVMs has an acceptable safety profile when approached in a multidisciplinary manner at an experienced institution, using surgical resection as the primary treatment modality when applicable.",2018 Dec,2018,World neurosurgery,120,,e1156-e1162,eng,False,S1878-8750(18)32069-2;10.1016/j.wneu.2018.09.025;S1878-8750(18)32069-2;10.1016/j.wneu.2018.09.025,Journal Article,"Adult;Arteriovenous Fistula/epidemiology/*therapy;Embolization, Therapeutic;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/epidemiology/*therapy;Male;Microsurgery;Neurosurgical Procedures;Postoperative Complications/epidemiology;Radiosurgery;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Retrospective Studies;Stroke/epidemiology;Treatment Outcome",ARUBA;Arteriovenous malformation;Embolization;Microsurgical resection;Radiosurgery
23570151,Surgical management of Spetzler-Martin grade V AVM.,"The surgical management of giant arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) has been complicated and fraught with considerable risk. We retrospectively analysed seven patients with giant AVMs classified into Spetzler-Martin Grade V between 1993 and 1999. Six of seven surgical cases presented with haemorrhagic episodes and the other single case developed progressive neurological deficits. Four out of seven surgical cases developed haemorrhagic complications during surgery or postoperatively. This resulted in poor outcomes in two of four cases. The other five cases recovered well from surgery. Although no morbidity was found after preoperative embolisation in this series, incomplete embolisation did not decrease the rate of haemorrhagic complication. Nonhaemorrhagic complications of a new focal neurological deficit occurred in three cases, one case in hemiparesis and two cases in quadrant hemianopsia. This resulted in surgical injury of white matter pathway where deep feeders such as the lenticulostriate arteries or wedge shape nidus were evident. Successful removal of giant AVM depends on not only stepwise obliteration of AVM but also successful management of the deep feeders that may reside in white matter pathways. Preoperative embolisation should target inaccessible deep feeders.",2002 May,2002,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society,9 Suppl 1,,22-5,eng,False,,Journal Article,"Adult;Cerebral Hemorrhage/pathology/surgery;Combined Modality Therapy;Embolization, Therapeutic;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*pathology/*surgery/therapy;Intraoperative Complications/pathology;Male;Middle Aged;Postoperative Complications/pathology;Preoperative Care;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",
17005278,Impact of target point deviations on control and complication probabilities in stereotactic radiosurgery of AVMs and metastases.,"OBJECTIVE: Determination of the impact of inaccuracies in the determination and setup of the target point in stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) on the expectable complication and control probabilities. METHODS: Two randomized samples of patients with arteriovenous malformation (AVM) (n=20) and with brain metastases (n=20) treated with SRS were formed, and the probability for complete obliteration (COP) or complete remission (CRP), the size of the 10 Gy-volume in the brain tissue (VOI10), and the probability for radiation necrosis (NTCP) were calculated. The dose-effect relations for COP and CRP were fitted to clinical data. Target point deviations were simulated through random vectors and the resulting probabilities and volumes were calculated and compared with the values of the treatment plan. RESULTS: The decrease of the relative value of the control probabilities at 1mm target point deviation was up to 4% for AVMs and up to 10% for metastases. At 2 mm the median decrease was 5% for AVMs and 9% for metastases. The value for the target point deviation, at which COP and CRP decreased about 0.05 in 90% of the cases, was 1.3 mm. The increase of NTCP was maximally 0.0025 per mm target point deviation for AVMs and 0.0035/mm for metastases. The maximal increase of VOI10 was 0.7 cm(3)/mm target point deviation in both patient groups. CONCLUSIONS: The upper limit for tolerable target point deviations is at 1.3mm. If this value cannot be achieved during the system test, a supplementary safety margin should be applied for the definition of the target volume. A better accuracy level is desirable, in order to ensure optimal chances for the success of the treatment. The target point precision is less important for the minimization of the probability of radiation necroses.",2006 Oct,2006,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic,81,1,25-32,eng,False,S0167-8140(06)00421-X;10.1016/j.radonc.2006.08.022,Journal Article;Randomized Controlled Trial,"Brain/pathology;Brain Neoplasms/secondary/*surgery;Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Medical Errors/*adverse effects;Necrosis/etiology;Probability;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects;Remission Induction;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome",
23258522,Intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas: natural history and rationale for treatment with stereotactic radiosurgery.,"Dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) are abnormal arteriovenous communications within the dura. The symptoms depend on their location and the pattern of the venous drainage. Patients with cavernous sinus DAVFs often present with ocular manifestations such as exophthalmos, chemosis and diplopia. Patients with transverse or sigmoid sinus DAVFs frequently experience headache and tinnitus on the affected side. DAVFs with anterograde sinus or cortical venous drainage (CVD) have been clinically regarded as benign, whereas DAVFs with retrograde CVD are considered aggressive in behavior. Similar to other cerebral arteriovenous malformations, DAVFs can hemorrhage, with an estimated annual risk of approximately 1.8%. The recommended therapeutic intervention for a DAVF is dependent on the anticipated natural history of the lesion. Management options include surgical resection, embolization and radiosurgery. Radiosurgical treatment has been used for DAVFs in various locations including the anterior cranial fossa, cavernous sinus, transverse/sigmoid sinus, superior sagittal sinus and tentorium. We present an update on 321 DAVF patients treated at the Taipei Veterans General Hospital using Gamma Knife radiosurgery. The prescribed mean margin dose was 17.2 Gy. In our series, 98% of patients had a stable or improved clinical condition after radiosurgery. Stereotactic radiosurgery using the Gamma Knife is a safe and effective alternative for the treatment of DAVFs.",2013,2013,Progress in neurological surgery,27,,176-94,eng,False,10.1159/000341793;000341793;10.1159/000341793,Journal Article;Review,Central Nervous System Vascular Malformations/*diagnosis/*surgery;Humans;Radiosurgery/methods/*trends;Treatment Outcome,

METHODS: From a pool of 80 pediatric (< 18 years) who had undergone treatment for ruptured AVM with hemorrhage at our center between July 2018 and July 2022, we identified 36 patients with spontaneous bleeding due to AVM. Out of which, 20 were treated solely by embolization (group 1), while the remaining patients were treated surgically (with and without adjuvant embolization) (group 2). RESULT: Spetzler-Martin's grading of the lesion suggested seven lesions < 3 and 13 lesions ≥ 3 in the embolization group. Similarly, seven lesions were < 3 and nine ≥ 3 Spetzler-Martin grade in the surgery group. Incomplete embolization was associated with hemorrhage in two patients treated with curative intent and four patients treated with embolization as adjuvant in the surgery group (p = 0.01). On follow-up, 18 patients in the embolization group and 12 in the surgery group had Glasgow outcome scores ≥ 4 (p = 0.273). CONCLUSION: In the pediatric age group, incomplete embolization is the significant risk factor for hemorrhage in AVMs treated after a hemorrhagic stroke.

18573592,Does hemorrhagic presentation in cerebral arteriovenous malformations affect obliteration rate after gamma knife radiosurgery?,"OBJECTIVES: Radiosurgery has been widely adopted for the treatment of cerebral AVMs. However radiosurgical treatment of patients with hemorrhagic presentation is fraught with risk of rebleed during latency period. The present study intends to analyze the obliteration rate, time to obliteration and chances of rebleed in patients with hemorrhagic versus non-hemorrhagic clinical presentation in cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) treated with gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of all the patients with cerebral AVMs treated from May 1997 to June 2006, 157 patients with neuroimaging follow up with digital subtraction angiography harboring 160 AVM nidii formed the study group. The mean age of presentation was 28 years (range, 6-58 years); mean nidus volume being 3.64 cm3 (range, 0.011-36.6 cm3). The mean follow up period was 70 months (range, 13-121 months). All the patients were treated predominantly by primary GKS with use of adjunctive pre-GKS embolization in selected patients. RESULTS: A total of 103 (64%) patients presented with hemorrhage. There was no difference in the obliteration rate (69% versus 67%, p=0.672), mean latency period to obliteration (30 months versus 32 months, p=0.1989) and chances of hemorrhage (4.8% versus 3.5%, p=0.690) in patients with hemorrhagic as compared to non-hemorrhagic presentation. CONCLUSION: Prior hemorrhage does not affect the outcome after GKS in terms of obliteration rate, latency to obliteration as well as chances of hemorrhage during latency period. Gamma knife appears equally efficacious irrespective of the mode of clinical presentation in the management of cerebral AVMs; a concomitant use of pre-GKS embolization/surgery may be needed in patients with hemorrhagic presentation in selected cases, however.",2008 Sep,2008,Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,110,8,804-9,eng,False,10.1016/j.clineuro.2008.05.004;S0303-8467(08)00168-6;10.1016/j.clineuro.2008.05.004,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Angiography, Digital Subtraction;Cerebral Angiography;Cerebral Hemorrhage/*etiology/*surgery;Child;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*complications/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Radiometry;*Radiosurgery;Survival Analysis;Tomography, X-Ray Computed;Treatment Outcome",
25360855,Microsurgical treatment of arteriovenous malformations in pediatric patients: the Boston Children's Hospital experience.,"OBJECT: Outcomes of microsurgical treatment of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in children are infrequently reported across large cohorts. METHODS: The authors undertook a retrospective review of departmental and hospital databases to obtain the medical data of all patients up to 18 years of age who were diagnosed with cerebral AVMs. Demographic and AVM angioarchitectural characteristics were analyzed, and for the patients who underwent surgery, the authors also analyzed the estimated intraoperative blood loss, postoperative angiographically confirmed obliteration rates, and neurological complications and outcomes classified according to the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). RESULTS: Of 117 children with cerebral AVMs, 94 underwent microsurgical resection (80%). Twenty (21%) of these 94 patients underwent adjunctive preoperative embolization. The overall postoperative angiographically confirmed obliteration rate was 94%. As part of a new protocol, the last 50 patients in this series underwent immediate perioperative angiography, improving the subsequent obliteration rate from 86% to 100% (p = 0.01). No other factors, such as a hemorrhagic AVM, size of the AVM, location, drainage, or Spetzler-Martin grade, had a statistically significant impact on the obliteration rate. Perioperative neurological deficits occurred in 17% of the patients, but the vast majority of these (77%) were predictable visual field cuts. Arteriovenous malformations that were hemorrhagic or located in noneloquent regions were each associated with lower rates of postoperative neurological complications (p = 0.05 and 0.002, respectively). In total, 94% of the children had good functional outcomes (mRS Scores 0-2), and these outcomes were significantly influenced by the mRS score on presentation before surgery (p = 0.01). A review of 1- and 5-year follow-up data indicated an overall annual hemorrhage rate of 0.3% and a recurrence rate of 0.9%. CONCLUSIONS: Microsurgical resection of AVMs in children is associated with high rates of angiographically confirmed obliteration and low rates of significant neurological complications. Implementation of a protocol using perioperative angiography in this series led to complete radiographically confirmed obliteration of all AVMs, with low annual repeat hemorrhage and recurrence rates.",2015 Jan,2015,Journal of neurosurgery.

38848585,Surgical treatment of brain arteriovenous malformations in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: a single-center experience.,"OBJECTIVE: Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by multiple vascular malformations. Brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) are a significant manifestation of HHT. The surgical management of these lesions in patients with HHT remains debated, with limited literature on postoperative outcomes. The goal of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of surgical treatment for bAVMs in patients with HHT and propose a treatment rationale based on a single-center experience. METHODS: This retrospective review included 20 patients diagnosed with HHT who underwent resection of 23 bAVMs at the Stanford University Medical Center between January 2007 and September 2023. Data were also collected on bAVMs treated conservatively, with embolization, or with radiosurgery at the authors' institution, for comparison. RESULTS: There were 16 Spetzler-Martin (SM) grade I, 6 SM grade II, and 1 SM grade IV bAVM. Six of the bAVMs presented with neurological symptoms (3 with hemorrhage and 3 with focal neurological deficits), while the rest were detected on routine screening. Complete excision was angiographically confirmed in all patients, with a mean overall hospital stay of 2.1 days and a mean follow-up of 36 months. Postoperative complications were limited to transient mild weakness in 2 patients, 1 of whom also had transient speech deficits, and visual field deficits in 3 patients, 2 of whom improved on long-term follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In this most extensive surgical series published to date, resection of bAVMs in patients with HHT showed favorable outcomes with a low complication rate, suggesting that the benefits of surgery outweigh the risks, especially considering the potential cumulative lifetime risk of hemorrhage.

Between 1998 and 2008, 164 patients with AVM received SRS. Median age was 36 years (range 7-69 years). Before SRS, 39 % of the patients experienced haemorrhage and 27 % suffered from epileptic seizures, whereas 43 % received previously embolization, 7.9 % neurosurgery and 1.8 % proton radiotherapy. Primary SRS was applied in 51.2 % of the patients. Median single dose was 19 Gy (80 % isodose; range 18-20 Gy) and median target volume was 4 cc (range 0.1-24.4). Median follow-up was 93 months (range 12-140). Complete obliteration (CO) was observed in 100 (61 %) patients at a median time of 29 months (range 6.1-88.5). The 3 and 5-year CO rates were 61 and 88 %, respectively. In multivariate analysis, radiation dose ≥ 19 Gy (p = 0.044) and target volume <4 cc (p = 0.015) were associated with significantly higher rates of CO. Intracranial haemorrhage was seen in nine patients (5.5 %) after SRS, whereas three patients (1.8 %) died as a consequence of bleeding. The annual bleeding risk was 1.3 % after 1 year and 1.3 % after 2 years, respectively. In multivariate analysis, only target volume >4 cm(3) (p = 0.031) and Spetzler-Martin grade III-V (p = 0.046) retained significance for increased risk of intracranial bleeding. After SRS an improvement in epileptic episodes, headaches and motor-sensory deficits was found in 8.5, 14 and 15 % of patients, respectively. Our long-term follow-up data show that SRS is an effective treatment option in AVM with low toxicity and bleeding risk, depending on AVM size and Spetzler-Martin grade.

19129961,Adverse radiation effects after Gamma Knife Surgery in relation to dose and volume.,"INTRODUCTION: The relationship between target volume and adverse radiation effects (AREs) at low prescription doses requires elucidation. The development of AREs in three series of patients treated in the Gamma Knife is analysed in relation to prescription dose and target volume. MATERIALS AND METHODS: There were three groups. In group 1, there were of 275 patients with meningiomas; in group 2, 132 patients with vestibular schwannomas; and in group 3, 107 patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). The minimum follow-up for each group was more than 24 months. All patients were followed up at six monthly intervals. The patients with tumours received a prescription dose of 12 Gy, which was varied to protect normal structures but not in relation to tumour volume per se. The desired AVM prescription dose was 25 Gy, but this was also reduced to protect normal structures and to keep the total dose within certain pre-defined limits. All AREs refer to intra-parenchymal increased perilesional T2 signal on MR irrespective of clinical correlation. RESULTS: There was no relationship between tumour volume and the development of ARE in the tumour groups. There was a highly significant relationship between target volume and the development of ARE for the AVMs with their much higher dose. Radiation-induced clinical trigeminal and facial nerve deficits with both vestibular schwannomas and meningiomas were always associated with an increased T2 signal in the neighbouring brainstem parenchyma. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between target volume and the risk of adverse radiation effects may not apply with lower prescription doses. Individual radiosensitivity may explain why a minority suffer AREs unrelated to target volume.

26732956,Radiosurgery for Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformations with Associated Arterial Aneurysms.,"OBJECTIVE: The radiosurgical outcomes for cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM) with AVM-associated arterial aneurysms (AAA) are poorly understood, because many AAAs are embolized before nidal intervention. The aim of this retrospective case-control study is to determine the effect of AAAs on AVM radiosurgery outcomes. METHODS: We evaluated an institutional AVM radiosurgery database from 1989 to 2013. AAAs were classified as intranidal (type I) or prenidal (type II). The case cohort comprised AVMs with patent type I or II AAAs. The control cohort comprised AVMs without AAAs and matched 2:1 to the case cohort. RESULTS: The case cohort comprised 51 AVMs, including 23 with type I and 28 with type II AAAs. The control cohort comprised 102 AVMs without AAAs. The cumulative AVM obliteration, annual postradiosurgery hemorrhage, and radiologically evident radiation-induced changes rates were 67%, 3.3%, and 28%, respectively, for the case cohort, compared with 70%, 2.0%, and 35%, respectively, for the control cohort. The presence of an AAA was not significantly associated with obliteration (P = 0.293), postradiosurgery hemorrhage (P = 0.209), or radiation-induced changes (P = 0.323). The rates of type II AAA occlusion at 3, 5, and 10 years were 46%, 77%, and 95%, respectively. The type II AAA occlusion rate was significantly higher in obliterated AVMs (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Patent intranidal or prenidal AAAs do not significantly affect AVM radiosurgical outcomes. Occlusion of distal prenidal AAAs commonly occurs after radiosurgery. These findings may support a more conservative stance for embolization before radiosurgery for AVMs with AAAs.",2016 Mar,2016,World neurosurgery,87,,77-90,eng,True,S1878-8750(15)01703-9;10.1016/j.wneu.2015.11.080;S1878-8750(15)01703-9;10.1016/j.wneu.2015.11.080,Journal Article,"Adult;Aged;Case-Control Studies;Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic;*Embolization, Therapeutic;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Aneurysm/*complications/*therapy;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*complications/*surgery;Intracranial Hemorrhages/etiology/prevention & control;Kaplan-Meier Estimate;Male;Middle Aged;Proportional Hazards Models;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects;Retrospective Studies;Seizures/etiology/prevention & control;Treatment Outcome",Gamma knife;Intracranial aneurysm;Intracranial arteriovenous malformation;Intracranial hemorrhages;Radiosurgery;Stroke;Vascular malformations
19008768,Extensive white matter changes after stereotactic radiosurgery for brain arteriovenous malformations: a prognostic sign for obliteration?,"OBJECTIVE: Perinidal high-signal-intensity changes on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging can be seen surrounding radiosurgically treated brain arteriovenous malformations (AVM). Occasionally, these signal intensity changes develop far beyond the irradiated volume. A retrospective analysis of both the pre- and postradiosurgery magnetic resonance imaging and angiographic studies was performed to analyze the cause of these extensive perinidal white matter changes. METHODS: The pre- and postradiosurgical magnetic resonance imaging and angiographic studies of 30 patients with T2 high-signal-intensity changes surrounding a brain AVM were analyzed retrospectively. Patients were divided into 2 groups on the basis of the extension of the signal intensity changes within or beyond the 10-Gy isodose area. The angiographic analysis was focused on the venous drainage pattern (deep versus superficial), venous stenosis, and the number of draining veins before and after radiosurgery. In addition, the obliteration rate was determined for the 2 subgroups. RESULTS: Fourteen patients (47%) showed high-signal-intensity changes far beyond the 10-Gy isodose area. A single draining vein was more often present in these patients with extensive T2 hyperintensity signal changes than in the other group. Obliteration was achieved in 12 (88%) of 14 patients with extensive signal intensity changes, as opposed to 8 (50%) of 16 patients in the other group. CONCLUSION: High-signal-intensity changes after radiosurgery for brain AVMs, far beyond the 10-Gy isodose area on T2-weighted images, are especially seen in brain AVMs draining through a single vein. The higher occlusion rate of brain AVMs under these circumstances is well appreciated.",2008 Dec,2008,Neurosurgery,63,6,1064-9; discussion 1069-70,eng,False,10.1227/01.NEU.0000330413.73983.02;10.1227/01.NEU.0000330413.73983.02,Controlled Clinical Trial;Journal Article,"Adult;Brain Injuries/*etiology/*pathology;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;Nerve Fibers, Myelinated/*pathology/*radiation effects;Radiation Injuries/*etiology/*pathology;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome",
29124649,Angiotensin receptor blockade: a novel approach for symptomatic radiation necrosis after stereotactic radiosurgery.,"Preclinical evidence suggests angiotensin blockade therapy (ABT) decreases late radiation toxicities. This study aims to investigate the association between ABT and symptomatic radiation necrosis (SRN) following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Resected brain metastases (rBM) and arteriovenous malformation (AVM) patients treated with SRS from 2002 to 2015 were identified. Patients in the ABT cohort were on therapy during SRS and at 1-month follow up. Kaplan Meier method and cumulative incidence model were used to analyze overall survival (OS) and intracranial outcomes. 228 consecutive patients were treated with SRS: 111 with rBM and 117 with AVM. Overall, 51 (22.4%) patients were in the ABT group: 32 (28.8%) in the rBM and 19 (16.2%) in AVM cohorts. Baseline characteristics were similar, except for higher Graded Prognostic Analysis (3-4) in the rBM (ABT: 25.0% vs. non-ABT: 49.0%, p = 0.033) and median age in the AVM (ABT: 51.4 vs. non-ABT: 35.4, p < 0.001) cohorts. In both populations, OS and intracranial efficacy (rBM-local control; AVM-obliteration rates) were statistically similar between the cohorts. ABT was associated with lower 1-year SRN rates in both populations: rBM, 3.1 versus 25.3% (p = 0.003); AVM, 6.7 vs. 14.6% (p = 0.063). On multivariate analysis, ABT was a significant predictive factor for rBM (HR: 0.17; 95% CI 0.03-0.88, p = 0.035), but did not reach statistical significance for AVM (HR: 0.36; 95% CI 0.09-1.52, p = 0.165).

11022081,Experimental radiosurgery simulations using a theoretical model of cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A novel biomathematical arteriovenous malformation (AVM) model based on electric network analysis was used to investigate theoretically the potential role of intranidal hemodynamic perturbations in elevating the risk of rupture after simulated brain AVM radiosurgery. METHODS: The effects of radiation on 28 interconnected plexiform and fistulous AVM nidus vessels were simulated by predefined random or stepwise occlusion. Electric circuit analysis revealed the changes in intranidal flow, pressure, and risk of rupture at intervals of 3 months during a 3-year latency period after simulated partial/complete irradiation of the nidus using doses <25 and >/=25 Gy. An expression for risk of rupture was derived on the basis of the functional distribution of the critical radii of component vessels. The theoretical effects of radiation were also tested on AVM nidus vessels with progressively increasing elastic modulus (E:) and wall thickness during the latency period, simulating their eventual fibrosis. RESULTS: In an AVM with E=5. 0x10(4) dyne/cm(2), 4 (14.3%) of a total 28 sets of AVM radiosurgery simulations revealed theoretical nidus rupture (risk of rupture >/=100%). Three of these were associated with partial nidus coverage and 1 with complete treatment. All ruptures occurred after random occlusion of nidus vessels in AVMs receiving low-dose radiosurgery. Intranidal hemodynamic perturbations were observed in all cases of AVM rupture; the occlusion of a fistulous component resulted in intranidal rerouting of flow and escalation of the intravascular pressure in adjacent plexiform components. Risk of rupture was found to correlate with nidus vessel wall strength: a low E: of 1.9x10(4) dyne/cm(2) resulted in a 92.8% incidence of AVM rupture, whereas a higher E: of 7.0x10(4) dyne/cm(2) resulted in only a 3.6% incidence of AVM rupture. A dramatic reduction in rupture incidence was observed when increasing fibrosis of the nidus was modeled during the latency period. CONCLUSIONS: It was found that the theoretical occurrence of AVM hemorrhage after radiosurgery was low, particularly when radiation-induced fibrosis of nidus vessels was considered. When rupture does occur, it would appear from a theoretical standpoint that the occlusion of intranidal fistulas or larger-caliber plexiform vessels could be a significant culprit in the generation of critical intranidal hemodynamic surges resulting in nidus rupture. The described AVM model should serve as a useful research tool for further theoretical investigations of cerebral AVM radiosurgery and its hemodynamic sequelae.",2000 Oct,2000,Stroke,31,10,2466-77,eng,False,10.1161/01.str.31.10.2466,Journal Article,"Cerebral Hemorrhage/*etiology/prevention & control;Computer Simulation;Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation;Elasticity/radiation effects;Hemodynamics/radiation effects;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/physiopathology/*surgery;*Models, Cardiovascular;Postoperative Complications/etiology/physiopathology;Radiation Pneumonitis/etiology;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects;Reaction Time/radiation effects;Risk Assessment;Rupture, Spontaneous/etiology/prevention & control;Vasodilation/radiation effects",

In the present report, we have offered an extensive review of each vascular pineal region lesion. METHODS: We performed an extensive literature review, focusing on the current therapeutic options available for the different vascular lesions of the pineal region. RESULTS: Vascular lesions of the pineal region are rare. Microneurosurgery remains a valid treatment of cavernomas, arteriovenous malformations, and aneurysms. Endovascular treatments seem to be the first option for the vein of Galen malformations, followed by microneurosurgery. Radiosurgery seems beneficial for small-size arteriovenous malformations.

22710381,Long-term outcomes after staged-volume stereotactic radiosurgery for large arteriovenous malformations.,"BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiosurgery is an effective treatment modality for small arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the brain. For larger AVMs, the treatment dose is often lowered to reduce potential complications, but this decreases the likelihood of cure. One strategy is to divide large AVMs into smaller anatomic volumes and treat each volume separately. OBJECTIVE: To prospectively assess the long-term efficacy and complications associated with staged-volume radiosurgical treatment of large, symptomatic AVMs. METHODS: Eighteen patients with AVMs larger than 15 mL underwent prospective staged-volume radiosurgery over a 13-year period. The median AVM volume was 22.9 mL (range, 15.7-50 mL). Separate anatomic volumes were irradiated at 3- to 9-month intervals (median volume, 10.9 mL; range, 5.3-13.4 mL; median marginal dose, 15 Gy; range, 15-17 Gy). The AVM was divided into 2 volumes in 10 patients, 3 volumes in 5 patients, and 4 volumes in 3 patients. Seven patients underwent retreatment for residual disease. RESULTS: Actuarial rates of complete angiographic occlusion were 29% and 89% at 5 and 10 years. Five patients (27.8%) had a hemorrhage after radiosurgery. Kaplan-Meier analysis of cumulative hemorrhage rates after treatment were 12%, 18%, 31%, and 31% at 2, 3, 5, and 10 years, respectively. One patient died after a hemorrhage (5.6%). CONCLUSION: Staged-volume radiosurgery for AVMs larger than 15 mL is a viable treatment strategy. The long-term occlusion rate is high, whereas the radiation-related complication rate is low.

24584136,Use of cone-beam computed tomography angiography in planning for gamma knife radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations: a case series and early report.,"BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKR) for cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is predicated on inclusion of the entire nidus while excluding normal tissue. As such, GKR may be limited by the resolution and accuracy of the imaging modality used in targeting. OBJECTIVE: We present the first case series to demonstrate the feasibility of using ultrahigh-resolution C-arm cone-beam computed tomography angiography (CBCT-A) in AVM targeting. METHODS: From June 2009 to June 2013, CBCT-A was used for targeting of all patients with AVMs treated with GKR at our institution. Patients underwent Leksell stereotactic head frame placement followed by catheter-based biplane 2-dimensional digital subtraction angiography, 3-dimensional rotational angiography, as well as CBCT-A. The CBCT-A dataset was used for stereotactic planning for GKR. Patients were followed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and then annually thereafter. RESULTS: CBCT-A-based targeting was used in 22 consecutive patients. CBCT-A provided detailed spatial resolution and sensitivity of nidal angioarchitecture enabling treatment. The average radiation dose to the margin of the AVM nidus corresponding to the 50% isodose line was 15.6 Gy. No patient had treatment-associated hemorrhage. At early follow-up (mean, 16 months), 84% of patients had a decreasing or obliterated AVM nidus.

33958052,The Role of Biological Effective Dose in Predicting Obliteration After Stereotactic Radiosurgery of Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformations.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether biological effective dose (BED) was predictive of obliteration after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied patients undergoing single-session AVM SRS between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 2014, with at least 2 years of imaging follow-up. Excluded were patients with syndromic AVM, previous SRS or embolization, and patients treated with volume-staged SRS. Biological effective dose was calculated using a mono-exponential model described by Jones and Hopewell. The primary outcome was likelihood of total obliteration defined by digital subtraction angiography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Variables were analyzed as continuous and dichotomous variables based on the maximum value of (sensitivity-[1-specificity]). RESULTS: This study included 352 patients (360 AVM, median follow-up, 5.9 years). The median margin dose prescribed was 18.75 Gy (interquartile range [IQR]: 18 to 20 Gy). Two hundred fifty-nine patients (71.9%) had obliteration shown by angiography (n=176) or MRI (n=83) at a median of 36 months after SRS (IQR: 26 to 44 months). Higher BED was associated with increased likelihood of obliteration in univariate Cox regression analyses, when treated as either a dichotomous (≥133 Gy; hazard ratio [HR],1.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.19 to 1.95; P<.001) or continuous variable (HR, 1.00, 95% CI, 1.0002 to 1.005; P=.04). In multivariable analyses including dichotomized BED and location, BED remained associated with obliteration (P=.001). CONCLUSION: Biological effective dose ≥133 Gy was predictive of AVM obliteration after single-session SRS within the prescribed margin dose range 15 to 25 Gy.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of patients with AVM who had been treated with SRS at 8 participating International Radiosurgery Research Foundation sites. The patient and AVM characteristics were compared between those with and without seizure presentation in univariable and multivariable models. A subgroup analysis of patients with cortical AVMs was performed. RESULTS: The study cohort included 2333 patients with AVM, including 419 (18%) with and 1914 (82%) without a seizure presentation. Previous AVM resection (odds ratio [OR], 7.65; P = 0.001), a lack of previous AVM hemorrhage (OR, 0.004; P < 0.001), a cortical AVM location (OR, 1559.42; P < 0.001), a lower Spetzler-Martin grade (OR, 0.51; P = 0.007), and a higher Virginia radiosurgery AVM score (OR, 1.46; P = 0.008) were independent predictors of seizure presentation. The rate of seizure presentation in patients with cortical AVMs was 27%. Previous AVM resection (OR, 8.36; P < 0.001), a lack of previous AVM hemorrhage (OR, 0.004; P < 0.001), and temporal AVM location (OR, 4.15; P < 0.001) were independent predictors of seizure presentation for cortical AVMs. CONCLUSION: We identified multiple factors associated with seizure presentation in patients with AVM to undergo SRS. Previous AVM resection, a cortical AVM location, and a lack of previous AVM hemorrhage were the strongest predictors of pre-SRS seizures. The Spetzler-Martin grade and Virginia radiosurgery AVM score might have a role in seizure risk stratification.

11803585,Rupture of pial arteriovenous malformation associated with early thrombosis of the draining system following stereotactic radiosurgery--case report.,"A 50-year-old man was treated with stereotactic gamma knife radiosurgery for an incidentally detected small callosal arteriovenous malformation (AVM) with stenosis of the main draining pathway. He suffered two episodes of intraventricular hemorrhage at 4 and 14 weeks after the radiosurgery. Radiological studies demonstrated that the anterior portion of the draining system including a varix, which had been irradiated, was thrombosed before the obliteration of arteriovenous shunts. Stereotactic radiosurgery is an accepted treatment for selected small and medium AVMs, but this procedure may increase the risk of bleeding. Early occlusion of a part of the draining pathway after stereotactic radiosurgery might have induced AVM rupture.

26232210,Surgical Management of Giant Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations: A Single Center Experience over 32 years.,"OBJECTIVE: Treatment of giant intracranial arteriovenous malformations (gAVMs) is a formidable challenge for neurosurgeons and carries significant morbidity and mortality rates for patients compared with smaller AVMs. In this study, we reviewed the treatments, angiographic results, and clinical outcomes in 64 patients with gAVMs who were treated at Henry Ford Hospital between 1980 and 2012. METHODS: The arteriovenous malformation (AVM) database at our institution was queried for patients with gAVMs (≥ 6 cm) and data regarding patient demographics, presentation, AVM angioarchitecture, and treatments were collected. Functional outcomes as well as complications were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 64 patients, 33 (51.6%) were female and 31 (48.4%) were male, with an average age of 45.7 years (SD ± 15.5). The most common symptoms on presentation were headaches (50%), seizures (50%), and hemorrhage (41%). The mean AVM size was 6.65 cm (range, 6-9 cm). Only 6 AVMs (9.4%) were located in the posterior fossa. The most common Spetzler-Martin grade was V, seen in 64% of patients. Of the 64 patients, 42 (66%) underwent surgical excision, 10 (15.5%) declined any treatment, 8 (12.5%) were deemed inoperable and followed conservatively, 2 (3%) had stand-alone embolization, 1 (1.5%) had embolization before stereotactic radiosurgery, and 1 (1.5%) received stereotactic radiosurgery only. Complete obliteration was achieved in 90% of the surgical patients. Mortality rate was 19% in the surgical cohort compared with 22% in the observation cohort (P = 0.770).

29530384,Awake craniotomy for excision of arteriovenous malformations? A qualitative comparison study with stereotactic radiosurgery.,"Treatment of arteriovenous malformations (AVM) located at the eloquent area has been a challenge. Awake brain mapping allows identification of a non-eloquent gyrus for intervention and can potentially facilitate resection with preservation of functions. An alternative treatment option is stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). The objective of this study was to perform a qualitative comparison of the treatment outcome of awake AVM excision versus SRS. We conducted a 13-year retrospective review of AVM excision under awake craniotomy performed at Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong, from 2003 to 2016. Patients' presentation, Spetzler-Martin (SM) grading, rate of obliteration and complication were reviewed and analyzed with the modified radiosurgery-based AVM score (RS score). Six patients had excision of AVM under awake mapping during this period of time. Two were SM Grade II and four were SM Grade III. Five located at the peri-rolandic region while one at the temporal language area. None had failed mapping. Five out of six achieved complete obliteration (83.3%). Qualitative comparative analysis had revealed better treatment outcome with awake AVM excision as compared to SRS with the obliteration rate of 100% versus 96% for RS score ≤1.00, 100% versus 78% for RS score 1.01-1.50, and 66% versus 50% for RS score >2.00 respectively. In conclusion, awake mapping and excision of AVMs at the eloquent area is feasible.

20424460,Appraising the plasticity of the circle of Willis: a model of hemodynamic modulation in cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVES: Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) harbor a network of abnormal vasculatures, namely the nidus between arterial and venous components. The pressure gradient between these two components results in abnormal high-velocity arteriovenous shunts flowing through the nidus and alternate intracranial hemodynamics. This study hypothesizes that the flow patterns of the circle of Willis (CoW) are modulated by the alternation of intracranial hemodynamics occurring in cerebral AVMs. The flow patterns of the CoW before and after AVMs had been corrected and the arteriovenous shunts closed by radiosurgery were assessed to validate the hypothesis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty patients (32 men and 18 women; mean age 35.8 +/- 4.2, range 23-52 years) with cerebral AVMs previously treated by radiosurgery were retrospectively investigated. This investigation used magnetic resonance angiography, performed prior to and after AVM surgery, to assess the CoW flow patterns. RESULTS: The CoW flow patterns in nearly half of the subjects (20/50, 40%) altered after the AVMs had been corrected. The alterations included: (1) decreased size or ceased flow patterns in the CoW vascular segment: ipsilateral A1 (n = 1) of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA), ipsilateral posterior communicating artery (PCoA) segment (n = 7), contralateral PCoA collateral (n = 4), bilateral PCoA (n = 2); (2) increased size or opening of the previous 'hypoplastic' segment of CoW: ipsilateral A1 of ACA (n = 1), contralateral PCoA (n = 2), bilateral PCoA (n = 1), and (3) biphasic alteration of the CoW: ceased ipsilateral PCoA segment and opening ipsilateral A1 of the ACA (n = 1), ceased ipsilateral PCoA and opening contralateral P1 of the posterior cerebral artery (n = 1). CONCLUSION: The plasticity of the flow patterns in the CoW are modulated by intracranial hemodynamics as shown by the AVM model. The calibers of CoW arterial segments are not a static feature. Willisian collateralization with recruitment of the CoW segment may cease, or hypoplastic segments may reopen after closing arteriovenous shunts of the AVM.",2010,2010,European neurology,63,5,295-301,eng,False,10.1159/000292431;000292431;10.1159/000292431,Journal Article,"Adult;Brain/blood supply/physiopathology/surgery;Cerebral Angiography;Cerebral Arteries/physiopathology;*Cerebrovascular Circulation;Circle of Willis/*physiopathology;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*physiopathology/*surgery;Longitudinal Studies;Magnetic Resonance Angiography;Male;Middle Aged;*Models, Cardiovascular;Radiosurgery;Regional Blood Flow;Retrospective Studies;Time Factors;Young Adult",

The present study was to review the techniques, their conjunctions and effectiveness. Methods Eligible related articles were identified by searching the PubMed and Web of Science databases using ""transvenous"" and ""arteriovenous malformation."" Results A total of 16 eligible studies, with 60 cases of AVM treated with TRAE, were analyzed. Prior to TRAE procedure, transarterial Onyx 18 was performed in 23 (38.3%), cyanoacrylate in three (5%) and coiling in two (3.3%), neurosurgery in one (1.7%) and radiosurgery in three (5%). These prior treatments were used to reduce the size of the nidus to <3 cm and TRAE was performed. One anterior choroidal artery aneurysm was coiled before TRAE. Systemic hypotension (blood pressure<100 mmHg) occurred in six (10%) patients and local hypotension (proximal arterial temporary balloon protection) in five (8.3%) patients. Complete obliteration was achieved in 56 (93.3%) AVMs, four (6.7%) with residual, of which one was supplemented with radiosurgery. During mean one-year follow-up (1 month to 3.2 years), there were five cases (8.3%) of permanent disability and one (1.7%) mortality resulting from initial hemorrhage. Fifty-four (90%) patients were independent (mRS ≤ 2) at follow-up. Ruptured AVMs and Spetzler-Martin I-III were associated with a high cure rate.

31802427,Occlusion of Animal Model Arteriovenous Malformations Using Vascular Targeting.,"Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are a significant cause of intracerebral hemorrhage in children and young adults. Currently, one third of patients have no viable treatment options. Vascular targeting agents (VTAs) are being designed to deliver pro-thrombotic molecules to the abnormal AVM vessels for rapid occlusion and cure. This study assessed the efficacy of a pro-thrombotic VTA targeting phosphatidylserine (PS) in a radiation-primed AVM animal model. The model AVM was surgically created in rats by anastomosis of the left external jugular vein to the adjacent common carotid artery. After 6 weeks, the AVM was irradiated (20 Gy) using gamma knife surgery (GKS). A PS-targeting VTA was created by conjugation of annexin V with human thrombin and administered intravenously 3 weeks post-GKS or sham. Unconjugated thrombin was used as a non-targeting control. AVM thrombosis and occlusion was monitored 3 weeks later by angiography and histology. Preliminary experiments established a safe dose of active thrombin for systemic administration. Subsequently, a single dose of annexin V-thrombin conjugate (0.77 mg/kg) resulted in angiographic AVM occlusion in sham (75%) and irradiated (63%) animals, while non-targeted thrombin did not. Lowering the conjugate dose (0.38 mg/kg) decreased angiographic AVM occlusion in sham (13%) relative to irradiated (80%) animals (p = 0.03) as did delivery of two consecutive doses of 0.38 mg/kg, 2 days apart (sham (0%); irradiated (78%); p = 0.003). These findings demonstrate efficacy of the PS-targeting VTA and the feasibility of a vascular targeting approach for occlusion of high-flow AVMs. Targeting specificity can be enhanced by radiation-sensitization and VTA dose modification.",2020 Aug,2020,Translational stroke research,11,4,689-699,eng,False,10.1007/s12975-019-00759-y;10.1007/s12975-019-00759-y;10.1007/s12975-019-00759-y,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Animals;Annexin A5/administration & dosage;*Disease Models, Animal;Fibrinolytic Agents/*administration & dosage;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/pathology/*therapy;Phosphatidylserines/*administration & dosage;Radiosurgery;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Thrombin/administration & dosage;Thrombolytic Therapy/*methods",Arteriovenous malformation;Endothelial cell;Phosphatidylserine;Radiosurgery;Thrombosis;Vascular targeting
30242732,"Probable pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of untreated arteriovenous malformation with cyst formation: case report and literature review.","Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) usually manifest as headaches, seizures, focal neurological signs, and spontaneous intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhages. An untreated AVM with associated cyst formation is extremely rare, and the probable pathogenesis is unclear. We propose and discuss the possible pathogenesis of this condition and its diagnosis and management. A 26-year-old male presented with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Computed tomography showed a cystic lesion in the left frontal lobe and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a complex composition within the lesion, without a flow-voiding signal. Therefore, the initial diagnosis was oligodendroglioma and surgical treatment was performed. However, intraoperatively, engorged reddish nodule-like vessels with a cystic capsule and intra-cyst brown and sticky fluid were found. The nodule-like vessels and cystic capsule were resected completely. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with an excellent neurological outcome and no further seizures. Pathological examination of the surgical specimen revealed the typical microscopic appearance of an AVM, with numerous thin-walled vascular channels and deposits of hemosiderin in fibrous tissue. In conclusion, an untreated AVM with associated cyst formation is extremely rare, and the mechanism of formation is unclear. We propose a probable pathogenesis. Preoperative diagnosis, intraoperative management, and postoperative follow-up are equally crucial in dealing with this extremely rare condition. Cystic tumors associated with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are uncommon and are usually a complication of stereotactic radiosurgery (Ilyas et al. in J Neurosurg. https://doi.org/10.3171/2016.12.JNS162478 , 2017) or form after a hemorrhage (Daniels et al. in Radiology 133:393-394, 1979).

15322842,Surgical results in pediatric Spetzler-Martin grades I-III intracranial arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTS: The goal of cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) therapy in pediatric patients should be complete resection or obliteration of the AVM to eliminate subsequent hemorrhage, because of high mortality and morbidity rates related to hemorrhage in addition to the longer life expectation. Despite advances in Gamma knife radiosurgery and in endovascular embolization, surgical resection is still the gold standard for treating cerebral AVMs. METHODS: Between 1986 and 2003, 20 children were surgically treated for cerebral AVMs. The AVMs were graded I, II, and III using the Spetzler-Martin (S-M) Grading Scale. Good recovery was achieved in 18 out of 20 patients (90%) and only 1 patient was moderately disabled (5%). There was one mortality (5%) related to the preoperative deep comatose state of the patient. The total obliteration rate was 89% (17 out of 19). CONCLUSION: For S-M grade I-III AVMs, surgical resection is the treatment of choice, considering its high cure rate and low morbidity and mortality rates.",2005 Jan,2005,Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for,21,1,69-74; discussion 75-6,eng,False,10.1007/s00381-004-1025-0,Clinical Trial;Comparative Study;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Angiography/methods;Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology/pathology/surgery;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Infant;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/classification/*pathology/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods;Male;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;*Severity of Illness Index;Treatment Outcome",
27073242,Risk Reduction of Cerebral Stroke After Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Small Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformations.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A Randomized Trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformations (ARUBA) indicated the superiority of medical management in reducing the risks for strokes and other neurological deficits over observation alone. The aim of our study was to verify the rationale for stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for small unruptured arteriovenous malformation. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed for 292 patients with unruptured arteriovenous malformations referred for SRS. The risks for cerebral hemorrhages were statistically compared before and after SRS. RESULTS: Of the 292 patients in whom arteriovenous malformation was found unruptured at initial diagnosis, 17 sustained hemorrhages in the period between the diagnosis and the initial therapeutic intervention (annual bleeding rate, 2.1%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2%-3.4%). Of the remaining 275 patients, 240 were initially treated with SRS, and 16 sustained a hemorrhage after SRS (annual bleeding rate, 1.1%; 95% CI, 0.6%-1.8%), but only 2 sustained a hemorrhage after angiographic obliteration (annual bleeding rate, 0.3%; 95% CI, 0.04%-1.2%). Comparing the risk of hemorrhage between the periods before and after SRS, a 53% risk reduction was achieved after SRS (hazard ratio, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.24-0.94; P=0.03), and 85% reduction was achieved after angiographic obliteration (hazard ratio, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.02-0.53; P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: SRS can significantly reduce the risk of stroke in the patients with small unruptured arteriovenous malformations.

38181511,Pediatric cerebral cavernous malformations and stereotactic radiosurgery: an analysis of 50 cases from a multicentric study.,"OBJECTIVE: Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are the second most common vascular anomaly affecting the CNS in children. Although stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has been proposed as an alternative to microsurgery in the management of selected cases in adults, there is a paucity of studies focusing on pediatric patients. The aim of this study was to present the outcomes and associated risks of SRS in this subgroup of patients. METHODS: This retrospective multicenter study included pediatric patients treated with single-session SRS for CCMs. The annual hemorrhage rate (AHR) was calculated before and after SRS in hemorrhagic lesions. The Engel classification was used to describe post-SRS epileptic control. Adverse radiation effects (AREs) and the occurrence of new neurological deficits were recorded. RESULTS: The study included 50 patients (median age 15.1 [IQR 5.6] years) harboring 62 CCMs. Forty-two (84%) and 22 (44%) patients had a history of hemorrhage or epilepsy prior to SRS, respectively. The AHR from diagnosis to SRS excluding the first hemorrhage was 7.19 per 100 CCM-years, dropping to 3.15 per 100 CCM-years after treatment. The cumulative risk of first hemorrhage after SRS was 7.4% (95% CI 0%-14.3%) at 5 years and 23.6% (95% CI 0%-42.2%) at 10 years. Eight hemorrhagic events involving 6 CCMs in 6 patients were recorded in the post-SRS follow-up period; 4 patients presented with transient symptoms and 4 with permanent symptoms. Of the 22 patients with pre-SRS seizures, 11 were seizure free at the last follow-up (Engel class I), 6 experienced improvement (Engel class II or III), 5 had no improvement (Engel class IVA or IVB), and 1 experienced worsening (Engel class IVC). Radiographic AREs were documented in 14.5% (9/62) of CCMs, with 4 being symptomatic.

27637640,A Prospective and Retrospective Study of Cerebral AVM Treatment Strategies 1990-2014.,"Although treatment options for cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) have changed since the advent of endovascular surgery and radiosurgery, microsurgery is still the major treatment option since it is effective for immediate cure. We proposed, and have applied, a revised treatment strategy to patients at our institution from February 2008 to May 2014, in which the final goal was disappearance of the nidus on angiography in patients who underwent surgical intervention. We followed 67 patients with cerebral AVMs, and in the 59 patients who had surgical intervention, the cure rate was 89.8 % (53 of 59). In all 67 patients, the surgical extirpation rate was 70.1 % (47/67). These rates were significantly higher than those between 1990 and 2008 at our institute. Microsurgical extirpation-related complications were a postoperative fatal hemorrhage in one patient, and visual field defects in two. In the endovascular treatment, two patients experienced hemiparesis, and radiosurgery-related complications were a fatal hemorrhage in one patient. Two patients from the non-surgical intervention group suffered from fatal hemorrhage.

26509647,Outcomes of Multimodality Therapy in Pediatric Patients With Ruptured and Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformations.,"BACKGROUND: Brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVMs) are a frequent cause of pediatric hemorrhagic stroke, which frequently results in significant morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the results of multimodality treatment for a consecutive series of pediatric patients with ruptured and unruptured BAVMs at a single institution. METHODS: Forty patients <18 years of age were retrospectively reviewed. Results were divided by hemorrhage status, ie, ruptured or unruptured, and the intended curative treatment modality, ie, surgical resection or stereotactic radiosurgery. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients (68%) presented with hemorrhage, and 13 patients (32%) presented without hemorrhage. Among ruptured patients, 19 (70%) underwent surgery and 8 (30%) underwent stereotactic radiosurgery. In surviving patients who presented with hemorrhage, 23 of 26 (88%) had a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0 to 2 at the last follow-up, and 24 of 26 (92%) obtained radiographic cure. For unruptured BAVMs, all 6 patients with grade I to III BAVM obtained radiographic cure and had an mRS score of 0 to 1 at the last follow-up, whereas 1 of 5 patients (20%) with grade IV and V BAVM had BAVM obliteration and a mean mRS score of 1.8 at the last follow-up. In a total of 93.6 years of follow-up from date of presentation to last clinical follow-up, there was 1 hemorrhage (1.1%/y). Of 30 patients with radiographic obliteration, 2 patients had radiographic recurrence (7% incidence). CONCLUSION: The majority of ruptured patients had an mRS score of 0 to 2 at the last follow-up and obtained radiographic cure. Unruptured patients with grade I to III BAVMs had superior outcomes compared with those with grade IV and V AVMs. Treatment of grade I to III BAVMs appears safe, and additional study is needed to determine optimal strategies for the management of unruptured grade IV and V BAVMs.",2016 May,2016,Neurosurgery,78,5,695-707,eng,False,10.1227/NEU.0000000000001076;10.1227/NEU.0000000000001076,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Cerebral Angiography;Cerebral Revascularization/*methods;Child;Child, Preschool;Combined Modality Therapy/*methods;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Intracranial Hemorrhages/*etiology;Male;Microsurgery;Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Rupture, Spontaneous/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Tomography, X-Ray Computed;Treatment Outcome",

31339016,Coil-Protected Technique for Liquid Embolization in Neurovascular Malformations.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the coil-protected technique for liquid embolization in neurovascular malformations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-two patients who underwent coil-protected liquid embolization for symptomatic cranial (n = 13) and spinal (n = 9) arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) were identified. A total of 36 target feeder vessels were embolized with N-butyl cyanoacrylate and/or Onyx (Medtronic). This technique was used to promote delivery of a sufficient amount of liquid embolic agent into the target shunt or nidus in cases where tortuous feeding arteries preclude a microcatheter wedging techniqu and/or to prevent reflux of the liquid embolic agent in cases with a short safety margin. The procedure was considered technically successful if the target lesion was sufficiently filled with liquid embolic agent without unintentional reflux. Angiographic and clinical outcomes were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: Technical success was achieved for all 36 target feeders. Post-embolization angiographies revealed complete occlusion in 16 patients and near-complete and partial occlusion in three patients each. There were no treatment-related complications. Of the six patients who showed near-complete or partial occlusion, five received additional treatments: two received stereotactic radiosurgery for cerebral AVM, two underwent surgical removal of cerebral AVM, and one underwent additional embolization by direct puncture for a mandibular AVM. Finally, all patients showed complete (n = 19) or near-complete (n = 3) occlusion of the target AVF or AVM on follow-up angiographies.

28645182,Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Brainstem Arteriovenous Malformations: A Multicenter Study.,"BACKGROUND: The management of brainstem arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) is a formidable challenge. bAVMs harbor higher morbidity and mortality compared to other locations. OBJECTIVE: To review the outcomes following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) of bAVMs in a multicenter study. METHODS: Six medical centers contributed data from 205 patients through the International Gamma Knife Research Foundation. Median age was 32 yr (6-81). Median nidus volume was 1.4 mL (0.1-69 mL). Favorable outcome (FO) was defined as AVM obliteration and no post-treatment hemorrhage or permanent symptomatic radiation-induced complications. RESULTS: Overall obliteration was reported in 65.4% (n = 134) at a mean follow-up of 69 mo. Obliteration was angiographically proven in 53.2% (n = 109) and on MRA in 12.2% (n = 25). Actuarial rate of obliteration at 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10 yr after SRS was 24.5%, 43.3%, 62.3%, 73%, and 81.8% respectively. Patients treated with a margin dose >20 Gy were more likely to achieve obliteration (P = .001). Obliteration occurred earlier in patients who received a higher prescribed margin dose (P = .05) and maximum dose (P = .041). Post-SRS hemorrhage occurred in 8.8% (n = 18). Annual postgamma knife latency period hemorrhage was 1.5%. Radiation-induced complications were radiologically evident in 35.6% (n = 73), symptomatic in 14.6% (n = 30), and permanent in 14.6% (n = 30, which included long-tract signs and new cranial nerve deficits). FO was achieved in 64.4% (n = 132). Predictors of an FO were a higher Virginia radiosurgery AVM scale score (P = .003), prior hemorrhage (P = .045), and a lower prescribed maximum dose (P = .006). CONCLUSION: SRS for bAVMs results in obliteration and avoids permanent complications in the majority of patients.",2017 Dec 1,2017,Neurosurgery,81,6,910-920,eng,False,10.1093/neuros/nyx189;3884539;10.1093/neuros/nyx189,Journal Article;Multicenter Study,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Arteriovenous Fistula/*surgery;Brain Stem/surgery;Child;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Middle Aged;Radiation Injuries/epidemiology/etiology;Radiosurgery/*methods;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",Arteriovenous malformation;Brainstem;Embolization;Gamma knife;Hemorrhage;Outcome;Radiosurgery;Surgery

33189739,Multimodal management of ruptured cerebral micro-arteriovenous malformations: A retrospective series of 19 cases and a review of the literature.,"BACKGROUND: Micro-arteriovenous malformations (micro-AVMs) are defined as AVMs just visible on angiography with a nidus size between 0.5 and 1cm. Their principal manifestation is intracranial hemorrhage and their diagnosis and therapeutic management are still unclear. METHODS: The aim of our work was to show the clinical presentation, treatment and outcome of ruptured cerebral micro-AVMs in a retrospective cohort study of 19 patients and a systematic review of the literature. RESULTS: We obtained a total of 20 micro-AVMs in 19 patients. The mean age was 47.3 years. Clinical presentation was acute bleeding. The mean volume of hematoma was 12.9 mm(3) (0 - 60.4), with topographic distribution as follows: 64% cortical with supratentorial bleeding, 26% deep, and 10% in the posterior fossa. Among the 20 micro-AVMs of the series, 11 (55%) had endovascular management, 6 (30%) had surgical treatment and 3 (15%) had GK radiosurgery alone. All of our patients have been cured at the end of the follow up without re-permeabilization. In our series, clinical outcome showed good recovery with a mean score of 4.6 on Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). In the literature, 88% of patients had a GOS of 4 or 5. DISCUSSION: Intracerebral hematoma (ICH) was the main clinical manifestation. In the case of negative initial angiographic assessment, patients must have supraselective angiographic exploration. In the case of conservative treatment of hematoma, endovascular obliteration and microsurgical exclusion seems to be reasonable therapeutic options, according to our observations.",2021 Apr,2021,Neuro-Chirurgie,67,2,132-139,eng,False,S0028-3770(20)30461-6;10.1016/j.neuchi.2020.11.001;S0028-3770(20)30461-6;10.1016/j.neuchi.2020.11.001,Journal Article;Review,Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Angiography/methods;Arteriovenous Fistula/diagnostic imaging/*therapy;Cerebral Hemorrhage/diagnostic imaging/*therapy;Child;Combined Modality Therapy/methods;*Disease Management;Female;Hematoma/diagnostic imaging/*therapy;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/*therapy;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/methods;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult,Angiography;Arteriovenous malformation;Embolic;Hemorrhage
25444994,A cost comparative study of Gamma Knife radiosurgery versus open surgery for intracranial pathology.,"Resection is the traditional treatment for common intracranial pathologies including brain metastases, arteriovenous malformations (AVM), and acoustic neuromas. However, more recently Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS; Elekta AB, Stockholm, Sweden) has emerged as an effective, alternative treatment modality. There are limited data investigating the cost effectiveness of these two treatment modalities. In this study, we compare the costs of GKRS and open surgical excision. This was a retrospective study including all patients at a single-institution across a 3 year period with at least 12 months of post-resection follow-up for brain metastases, acoustic neuromas, or AVM. The costs of care were then totaled and compared to known average costs for GKRS at the same institution. The average 12 month costs of treating patients with brain metastases, acoustic neuromas, and AVM using open surgery were USD$55,938, $67,538, and $78,332, respectively. The average 12 month costs of treating brain metastases, acoustic neuromas, and AVM with GKRS were USD$23,069, $37,840, and $46,293, respectively. This shows that GKRS was on average 58.8%, 44.0%, and 40.9% of the cost of open surgery for brain metastases, acoustic neuromas, and AVM, respectively. GKRS is a cost effective, first-line, alternative to open surgery for treatment of brain metastatic lesions, acoustic neuromas, and AVM in selected patients. This result conforms to previous studies, which also demonstrate that radiosurgery is the more cost-effective treatment for brain metastases and acoustic neuromas when patients are well suited for either approach. Further prospective studies are needed to show that this result is valid at other institutions.",2015 Jan,2015,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society,22,1,184-8,eng,False,S0967-5868(14)00568-2;10.1016/j.jocn.2014.08.012;S0967-5868(14)00568-2;10.1016/j.jocn.2014.08.012,Comparative Study;Journal Article,"Brain Diseases/*economics/*surgery;Brain Neoplasms/surgery;Cost-Benefit Analysis;Craniotomy/economics;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/economics/surgery;Neuroma, Acoustic/economics/surgery;Neurosurgical Procedures/*economics;Radiosurgery/*economics;Retrospective Studies;Virginia",Acoustic neuroma;Arteriovenous malformation;Brain metastasis;Gamma Knife radiosurgery;Open surgery;Vestibular schwannoma
24530455,Radiosurgery for cerebellar arteriovenous malformations: does infratentorial location affect outcome?,"OBJECTIVE: The cerebellum is an uncommon location for arteriovenous malformations (AVM) with unique angioarchitecture compared to the cerebrum. We evaluate the outcomes of radiosurgery in a cohort of cerebellar AVMs and assess the effect of infratentorial location by comparing them to a matched cohort of supratentorial AVMs. METHODS: From a prospective AVM radiosurgery database of 1400 patients, we identified 60 cerebellar AVM patients with at least 2 years of radiologic follow-up or obliteration. The median volume and prescription dose were 2.3 mL and 22 Gy, respectively. The median radiologic follow-up was 39 months. The cerebellar AVM patients were matched (3:1) to a cohort of supratentorial, lobar AVM patients based on AVM size and patient age. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with obliteration and favorable outcome. RESULTS: Cerebellar and supratentorial AVMs were similar in baseline characteristics except for an increased incidence of ruptured lesions in the cerebellar AVM cohort (P < .001). Obliteration was achieved in 72% of cerebellar AVMs. Younger age (P = .019), no preradiosurgery embolization (P < .001), and decreased volume (P = .034) were independent predictors of obliteration. The annual risk of postradiosurgery hemorrhage in cerebellar AVMs was 1.3%. The rates of symptomatic and permanent radiation-induced changes were 7% and 3%, respectively. Compared with the matched supratentorial AVM cohort, there was no difference in the rates of obliteration, postradiosurgery hemorrhage, or symptomatic radiation-induced changes. CONCLUSIONS: Radiosurgery is an effective treatment modality for cerebellar AVMs with relatively limited adverse events.

30975463,Left Thalamus Arteriovenous Malformation Secondary to Radiation Therapy of Original Vermian Arteriovenous Malformation: Case Report.,"A 70-year-old gentleman with history of hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and right superior cerebellar aneurysm presented to the neurosurgery service in 2008 with vertigo. Diagnostic cerebral angiography performed that year demonstrated a vermian arteriovenous malformations (AVM). The patient underwent stereotactic proton beam radiosurgery, which resulted in a decrease in flow and size of the lesion, and the patient was lost to follow-up. Now at the age of 80, the patient presented with acute gait instability. Cerebral angiogram demonstrated his stable vermian AVM and a new 1.1 cm AVM nidus in the region of the left posterior thalamus. Although AVMs are often described as congenital lesions, there is a growing body of literature suggesting that AVMs can grow, spontaneously regress, and even arise de novo in response to some insult. Understanding what leads to the growth, remodeling, regression, and hemorrhage of AVMs is crucial in order to better direct therapeutic endeavors. We would argue that this patient's AVM is secondary to endothelial cell damage from radiation therapy. Radiation can cause endothelial cell injury and upregulation of factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor and transforming growth factor beta expression, which are implicated in AVM development pathways. We believe that this patient's new AVM is secondary to entrance radiation dosing affecting the thalamus during radiation therapy for the original vermian AVM.",2019 Jun,2019,Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National,28,6,e53-e59,eng,False,S1052-3057(19)30128-4;10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2019.03.033;S1052-3057(19)30128-4;10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2019.03.033,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Angiography, Digital Subtraction;Cerebellum/*blood supply;Cerebral Angiography/methods;Computed Tomography Angiography;Cranial Irradiation/*adverse effects;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic;Male;Proton Therapy/*adverse effects;Radiation Injuries/diagnostic imaging/*etiology;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects;Thalamus/*blood supply;Treatment Outcome",Arteriovenous malformation;radiation induced AVM;radiosurgery;secondary arteriovenous malformation;thalamus AVM;vermian AVM
11704319,An analysis of the effects of smoking and other cardiovascular risk factors on obliteration rates after arteriovenous malformation radiosurgery.,"PURPOSE: To assess the relationships of smoking and other cardiovascular disease risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and gender) to rates of radiosurgery-induced obliteration of arteriovenous malformations (AVM). METHODS AND MATERIALS: We evaluated follow-up imaging and clinical data in 329 AVM patients who received gamma knife radiosurgery at the University of Pittsburgh between 1987 and 1994. There were 113 smokers, 29 hypertensives, 5 diabetics, 4 hypercholesterolemics, 159 male patients, and 170 female patients. All patients had regular clinical or imaging follow-up for a minimum of 3 years after radiosurgery. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis showed that smoking had no effect on AVM obliteration (p > 0.43). Hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia had no discernible effect on AVM obliteration in this study (p > 0.78). However, females aged 12-49 had a statistically significant lower in-field obliteration rate than males (78% vs. 89%, p = 0.0102). CONCLUSION: Smoking has no effect on AVM obliteration. Hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia had no discernible effect in this study.

30233022,Temporary noncicatricial focal alopecia following Gamma knife radiosurgery: Case series and review of literature.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to report the pattern, timing, responsible radiation parameters, and dosimetric results on the outcome of alopecia following gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for various intracranial pathologies. A literature review of radiation-induced alopecia and observation of this complication with GKRS are also included. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors report 6 cases of GKRS-induced focal temporary alopecia without dermal fibrosis or clinical scarring and with no long-term squeal. RESULTS: In all the cases, the scalp received ≥3 Gy radiation exposure. Post GKRS alopecia is a temporary, noncicatricial, focal, reversible phenomenon observed within 2 weeks of the treatment. This acute complication is dose-dependent and reflects damage to the hair follicle. It is only seen with treated volumes in the superficial location. Hair regrowth occurs within two months with no long-term complications and change in hair quality being noted. CONCLUSION: Compared to whole brain radiotherapy, chances of alopecia are significantly less after GKRS. Despite a sharp dose fallout, a single fraction high-dose radiosurgery with GKRS may expose the skin appendages to more than 3 Gy radiation exposures, which may injure the hair follicles irrespective of the growth phase (anagen, telogen, or catagen) they are in. A careful planning that includes sparing of the dermal appendages and hair roots up to 4-6 mm depth in the skin may prevent this complication. Patients with superficial lesions should be well informed about the reversible nature of this possible complication, with near-normal hair growth being established within 2 months of treatment.",2018 Sep-Oct,2018,Neurology India,66,5,1469-1474,eng,False,10.4103/0028-3886.241362;ni_2018_66_5_1469_241362;10.4103/0028-3886.241362,Case Reports;Journal Article;Review,Adult;Alopecia/*etiology;Arteriovenous Fistula/radiotherapy;Brain Neoplasms/radiotherapy;Female;Glomus Jugulare Tumor/radiotherapy;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/radiotherapy;Male;Meningeal Neoplasms/radiotherapy;Meningioma/radiotherapy;Middle Aged;Radiation Dosage;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects;Young Adult,Alopecia;epilation;gamma knife radiosurgery;hair loss;radiation therapy
37439476,Timing of microsurgical resection for ruptured brain arteriovenous malformations: a propensity score-matched analysis using prospective single-center registry data.,"OBJECTIVE: The optimal microsurgical timing in ruptured brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is not well understood and is surrounded by controversy. This study aimed to elucidate the impacts of microsurgical resection timing on clinical outcomes. METHODS: The authors retrieved and reviewed the records on all ruptured AVMs treated at their institution and registered in a nationwide multicenter prospective collaboration registry between August 2011 and August 2021. Patients were dichotomized into an early resection group (≤ 30 days from the last hemorrhagic stroke) and a delayed resection group (> 30 days after the last hemorrhagic stroke). Propensity score-matched analysis was used to compare long-term outcomes. The primary outcome was neurological status as assessed using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). The secondary outcomes were complete obliteration rate, postoperative seizure, and postoperative hemorrhage. RESULTS: Of the 3649 consecutive AVMs treated at the authors' institution, a total of 558 ruptured AVMs were microsurgically resected and had long-term follow-up. After propensity score matching, 390 ruptured AVMs (195 pairs) were included in the comparison of outcomes. The mean (± standard deviation) clinical follow-up duration was 4.93 ± 2.94 years in the early resection group and 5.61 ± 2.56 years in the delayed resection group. Finally, as regards the distribution of mRS scores, short-term neurological outcomes were better in the delayed resection group (risk difference [RD] 0.3%, 95% CI -0.1% to 0.6%, p = 0.010), whereas long-term neurological outcomes were similar between the two groups (RD 0.0%, 95% CI -0.2% to 0.2%, p = 0.906). Long-term favorable neurological outcomes (early vs delayed: 90.8% vs 90.3%, p > 0.999; RD 0.5%, 95% CI -5.8% to 6.9%; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94-1.07) and long-term disability (9.2% vs 9.7%, p > 0.999; RD -0.5%, 95% CI -6.9% to 5.8%; RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.51-1.75) were also similar between these groups. In terms of secondary outcomes, postoperative seizure (early vs delayed: 8.7% vs 5.6%, p = 0.239; RD 3.1%, 95% CI -2.6% to 8.8%; RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.74-3.22), postoperative hemorrhage (1.0% vs 1.0%, p > 0.999; RD 0.0%, 95% CI -3.1% to 3.1%; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.14-7.04), and hospitalization time (16.4 ± 8.5 vs 19.1 ± 7.9 days, p = 0.793) were similar between the two groups, whereas early resection had a lower complete obliteration rate (91.3% vs 99.0%, p = 0.001; RD -7.7%, 95% CI -12.9% to 3.1%; RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.88-0.97).

25360851,Targeted intraarterial anti-VEGF therapy for medically refractory radiation necrosis in the brain.,"Radiation necrosis (RN) is a serious complication that can occur in up to 10% of brain radiotherapy cases, with the incidence dependent on both dose and brain location. Available medical treatment for RN includes steroids, vitamin E, pentoxifylline, and hyperbaric oxygen. In a significant number of patients, however, RN is medically refractory and the patients experience progressive neurological decline, disabling headaches, and decreased quality of life. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a known mediator of cerebral edema in RN. Recent reports have shown successful treatment of RN with intravenous bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody for VEGF. Bevacizumab, however, is associated with significant systemic complications including sinus thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, gastrointestinal tract perforation, wound dehiscence, and severe hypertension. Using lower drug doses may decrease systemic exposure and reduce complication rates. By using an intraarterial route for drug administration following blood-brain barrier disruption (BBBD), the authors aim to lower the bevacizumab dose while increasing target delivery. In the present report, the authors present the cases of 2 pediatric patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations, who presented with medically intractable RN following stereotactic radiosurgery. They received a single intraarterial infusion of 2.5 mg/kg bevacizumab after hyperosmotic BBBD. At mean follow-up duration of 8.5 months, the patients had significant and durable clinical and radiographic response. Both patients experienced resolution of their previously intractable headaches and reversal of cushingoid features as they were successfully weaned off steroids. One of the patients regained significant motor strength. There was an associated greater than 70% reduction in cerebral edema. Intraarterial administration of a single low dose of bevacizumab after BBBD was safe and resulted in durable clinical and radiographic improvements at concentrations well below those required for the typical systemic intravenous route. Advantages over the intravenous route may include higher concentration of drug delivery to the affected brain, decreased systemic toxicity, and a significantly lower cost.",2015 Jan,2015,Journal of neurosurgery.

18787195,"Patterns of brain arteriovenous malformation treatment: prospective, population-based study.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The extent of variation in the interventional treatment of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is unknown, so we explored patterns of treatment at 4 neuroscience centers in one European country. METHODS: We included every participant with an AVM in a prospective, population-based cohort study of adults aged >or=16 years residing in Scotland at the time of AVM diagnosis in 1999 to 2003. RESULTS: Only 11 (5%) of the 229 adults were not managed at a neuroscience center. Adults who received interventional treatment were younger (median, 43 versus 54 years), more likely to have presented with hemorrhage (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.6 to 4.9), and had smaller AVMs (median nidus diameter, 2 cm versus 3 cm; P=0.003) than those who did not. Adults seen at the 4 centers only differed in AVM Spetzler-Martin grade (P=0.04). The 4 centers did not differ in the proportion of adults with AVMs who received interventional treatment (P=0.16), but they differed in the Spetzler-Martin grade of the AVMs they treated (Grades III to IV, P=0.01) and the interventional treatments used (P=0.004).

28665253,The benefit of radiosurgery for ARUBA-eligible arteriovenous malformations: a practical analysis over an appropriate follow-up period.,"OBJECTIVE The authors of this study found that, given the latency period required for arteriovenous malformation (AVM) obliteration after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), a study with limited follow-up cannot assess the benefit of SRS for unruptured AVMs. METHODS The authors reviewed their institutional experience with ""ARUBA (A Randomized Trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformations)-eligible"" AVMs treated with SRS between 1987 and 2016, with the primary outcome defined as stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) or death (AVM related or AVM unrelated). Patients with at least 3 years of follow-up in addition to those who experienced stroke or died during the latency period were included. Secondary outcome measures included obliteration rates, patients with new seizure disorders, and those with new focal deficits without stroke. RESULTS Of 233 patients included in this study, 32 had a stroke or died after SRS over the mean 8.4-year follow-up (14%). Utilizing the 10% stroke or death rate at a mean 2.8-year follow-up for untreated AVMs in ARUBA, the rate in the authors' study is significantly lower than that anticipated at the 8.4-year follow-up for an untreated cohort (14% vs 30%, p = 0.0003). Notwithstanding obliteration, in this study, annualized rates of hemorrhage and stroke or death after 3 years following SRS were 0.4% and 0.8%, respectively. The overall obliteration rate was 72%; new seizure disorders, temporary new focal deficits without stroke, and permanent new focal deficits without stroke occurred in 2% of patients each.

10944012,Language mapping in pretreatment planning of patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformation: a PET study.,PURPOSE: Three patients who had cerebral arteriovenous malformations underwent language mapping by positron emission tomography (PET) to identify the dominant hemisphere for language and the spatial relation of lesions to language areas. METHODS: Mapping was performed to assess the risk that surgery could cause neurologic deficits and to plan other therapeutic strategies. RESULTS: The information obtained by PET language mapping changed the course of management for these patients. Two patients were treated with stereotactic radiosurgery and one patient with surgical resection.

CASE DESCRIPTION: An 8-year-old girl with a ruptured cerebellar arteriovenous malformation was treated with stereotactic radiosurgery. The nidus was completely obliterated 17 months after stereotactic radiosurgery; however, 20 years later she had a rupture of a recurrent nidus that occurred adjacent to the original nidus, accompanied by a radiation-induced cyst. Surgical resection was performed, and subsequent pathologic examination revealed 2 different compartments: a typical nidus and a postirradiated degenerated nidus with an encapsulated hematoma. Immunohistochemical stains showed increased expression of Ki-67 and decreased expression of endoglin in endothelial cells in the recurrent nidus. CONCLUSIONS: Depletion in endoglin may lead to the formation of vessel malformations in the presence of angiogenic stimuli. This case serves as a strong reminder of the importance of long-term follow-up after stereotactic radiosurgery, especially for pediatric cases.",2020 Mar,2020,World neurosurgery,135,,63-67,eng,False,S1878-8750(19)33006-2;10.1016/j.wneu.2019.11.156;S1878-8750(19)33006-2;10.1016/j.wneu.2019.11.156,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Adult;Brain Neoplasms/etiology/pathology/surgery;Female;Hematoma/etiology/pathology/surgery;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*etiology/pathology/*therapy;Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/pathology/surgery;*Radiosurgery;Recurrence;Rupture, Spontaneous/etiology/pathology/radiotherapy",Arteriovenous malformation;Endoglin;Gamma Knife;Stereotactic radiosurgery
10942007,Multimodality treatment of nongalenic arteriovenous malformations in pediatric patients.,"OBJECTIVE: Previously reported series of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in pediatric patients have primarily used a single-modality treatment approach of either surgery, radiosurgery, or embolization, with significant treatment-related morbidity and mortality. At our institution, we have used a combined multidisciplinary team approach of all three treatment modalities, alone or in combination, to minimize complications and to maximize efficacy in the management of these lesions. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 40 consecutive pediatric patients with AVMs seen at our institution from 1991 to 1999. A multidisciplinary team planned the treatment for each AVM. The treatment modality consisted of the following approaches: surgery alone in 14 patients, a combination of endovascular embolization and surgery in 6 patients, radiosurgery alone in 11 patients, a combination of endovascular embolization and radiosurgery in 2 patients, and a combination of radiosurgery and surgery in 2 patients. Four patients are receiving ongoing multistaged treatment for reduction of the nidus size for eventual surgical resection or radiosurgical obliteration of large, complex lesions. In one patient, no treatment was recommended. RESULTS: The clinical outcomes for the overall series were 95.0% excellent or good (Glasgow Outcome Scale score 5 or 4), 2.5% fair (Glasgow Outcome Scale score 3), and 2.5% dead. Radiographic efficacy in the patients who have completed treatment was 92.9% complete obliteration of their AVMs and 7.1% incomplete obliteration. Of the 10 patients who had seizures, 9 are seizure-free. CONCLUSION: A combined multimodality approach of surgery, radiosurgery, and embolization in managing AVMs in pediatric patients can improve outcomes and minimize morbidity and mortality.",2000 Aug,2000,Neurosurgery,47,2,346-57; discussion 357-8,eng,False,10.1097/00006123-200008000-00015,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Cerebral Angiography;Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology;Child;*Embolization, Therapeutic/adverse effects;Female;Glasgow Outcome Scale;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/mortality/surgery/*therapy;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Postoperative Complications;*Radiosurgery;Recurrence;Retrospective Studies;Seizures/etiology/therapy;Treatment Outcome",
15221308,Partially reversible quadruple sectoranopia caused by vascular steal due to an arteriovenous malformation.,"BACKGROUND: Lateral, homonymous upper and lower field blind sectors sparing a horizontal zone define quadruple sectoranopia. This rare campimetric deficit involves ischemia or infarction of parts of the lateral geniculate body supplied by the distal anterior choroidal artery. METHODS: A 41-year-old patient presented with a complaint of blurred vision. Visual acuity was 20/20 on both sides. Visual field showed a left quadruple sectoranopia. CT scan, MRI, MRA and conventional angiography showed a right cerebral arteriovenous malformation supplied partly by the right anterior choroidal artery. Partial retinal nerve fiber layer atrophy matched to the campimetric deficit proved that some degree of infarction involved the lateral geniculate body. RESULTS: The arteriovenous malformation was treated with stereotactic radiosurgery. Two years after treatment, the nidus had completely disappeared. The campimetric deficit began improving from 19 months onwards after stereotactic radiosurgery. Twenty-eight months after treatment, the superior defect had completely reversed. CONCLUSIONS: Quadruple sectoranopia involves ischemia or infarction of parts of the lateral geniculate body supplied by the distal anterior choroidal artery. Following radio-induced angioma thrombosis, blood was no longer shunted away from the right lateral geniculate body, whose viable areas resumed their activity. Accordingly, a partial campimetric recovery occurred.",2005 Jan,2005,Graefe's archive for clinical and experimental ophthalmology = Albrecht von,243,1,63-7,eng,False,10.1007/s00417-004-0937-4,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Adult;*Cerebral Arteries;Choroid/blood supply;Female;Geniculate Bodies/*blood supply/physiopathology;Hemianopsia/*etiology/physiopathology;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*complications/diagnostic;Magnetic Resonance Angiography;Radiosurgery;Tomography, X-Ray Computed;Visual Acuity;Visual Field Tests;Visual Fields",
12657169,Spetzler-Martin Grade III arteriovenous malformations: surgical results and a modification of the grading scale.,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze surgical results for the highly variable Spetzler-Martin Grade III arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), to demonstrate that outcomes vary among the different types of Grade III lesions, and to introduce a simple modification of the grading scale that might improve its usefulness for these AVMs. METHODS: In a consecutive series of 174 brain AVMs resected from 174 patients during a period of 4.8 years, 76 AVMs (45.2%) were Grade III. There were 35 small AVMs (S1V1E1) (46.1%), 14 medium/deep AVMs (S2V1E0) (18.4%), and 27 medium/eloquent AVMs (S2V0E1) (35.5%). No large Grade III AVM (S3V0E0) was treated. RESULTS: Complete AVM resection was accomplished for 74 patients (surgical obliteration rate, 97.4%). Three patients (3.9%) experienced permanent, treatment-associated, neurological morbidity, and three patients died (surgical mortality rate, 3.9%). Good outcomes (Rankin scale scores of <or=2) were observed for 59 patients (78.7%). Surgical risks (new deficit or death), according to the Grade III type, were 2.9% for small AVMs (S1V1E1), 7.1% for medium/deep AVMs (S2V1E0), and 14.8% for medium/eloquent AVMs (S2V0E1). CONCLUSION: Grade III AVMs are a heterogeneous group, with each type possessing different surgical risks, and the Spetzler-Martin grading scale should be modified accordingly. Grade III- AVMs (S1V1E1) have a surgical risk similar to that of low-grade AVMs and can be safely treated with microsurgical resection. Grade III+ AVMs (S2V0E1) have a surgical risk similar to that of high-grade AVMs and are best managed conservatively. Grade III AVMs (S2V1E0) have intermediate surgical risks and require judicious selection for surgery. Grade III* AVMs (S3V0E0) are either exceedingly rare, with a surgical risk that is unclear, or theoretical lesions with no clinical relevance.",2003 Apr,2003,Neurosurgery,52,4,740-8; discussion 748-9,eng,False,10.1227/01.neu.0000053220.02268.9c,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Brain Damage, Chronic/etiology/mortality;Child;Combined Modality Therapy;Embolization, Therapeutic;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/classification/mortality/*surgery;Male;Microsurgery;Middle Aged;Neurologic Examination;*Patient Care Team;Postoperative Complications/etiology/mortality;Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Risk",
12365671,Parieto-occipital arteriovenous malformation.,"BACKGROUND: Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in the occipital lobe has been known to cause visual symptoms and headaches. Arteriovenous malformation is a congenital anomaly that consists of abnormal arteries and veins without the presence of a capillary bed. The majority of patients initially manifest intracranial hemorrhage, while others manifest symptoms of seizures, headaches, and progressive neurological deficits. CASE REPORTS: A 45-year-old man was referred for a baseline threshold visual field before neurosurgery for his arteriovenous malformation. The patient's medical history included seizures with visual aura. The seizures were originally attributed to alcohol withdrawal; later, he was diagnosed with a right parietooccipital AVM. Optometric examination revealed an incomplete left inferior homonymous quadranopsia. He subsequently had the embolization and resection procedures for his AVM. Seizures and visual aura symptoms terminated after AVM surgery; the visual field defect increased slightly in extent. Two additional cases are presented to highlight some common characteristics-as well as the variability-in cerebral AVMs. The second case involves a 47-year-old man with a history of left frontal lobe AVM resection 7 years earlier and headaches. The third case is that of a 60-year-old man with a large left parietal lobe AVM with seizures who is anticipating neurosurgery. CONCLUSION: Clinical differentiation of migraine from arteriovenous malformation is often regarded as difficult, since both conditions may manifest similar features of visual aura, with or without headaches. Early diagnosis and treatment of AVM may reduce the risk of serious complications. When a patient manifests alarming headaches with or without visual aura, neuro-imaging workup is warranted to rule out sinister causes.",2002 Aug,2002,"Optometry (St. Louis, Mo.)",73,8,477-91,eng,False,,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Cerebral Angiography;Diagnosis, Differential;Diagnostic Techniques, Ophthalmological;Embolization, Therapeutic;Headache/etiology;Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/diagnostic;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Occipital Lobe/*blood supply;Parietal Lobe/*blood supply;Radiosurgery;Risk Assessment;Seizures/etiology;Sensory Thresholds;Vision Disorders/*etiology;Visual Fields;*Visual Perception",
29113859,Treatment decision for occipital arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) to achieve hemorrhagic control while maximizing visual preservation: Our experience and review of literature.,"Despite concern of hemorrhagic risk, patients with occipital AVMs are at significant risk for visual disturbances after treatment. We aim to characterize the hemorrhage risk and visual disturbance in occipital AVMs patients from our experience and literature review. We performed retrospective review of occipital AVM patients seen at our institution from 1990 to 2015. Patient characteristics were compared using multivariable logistic regression with follow-up visual disturbance as the outcome. We also systematically reviewed the PubMed database for English literature describing occipital AVMs (with exclusion of case reports). Ninety-seven patients satisfied inclusion criteria for our study. Mean age was 34.9 ± 16.4 years, with 50.5% male. Thirty-one (32.0%) presented with hemorrhage, and 32 (33.0%) presented with visual disturbance. Average AVM size was 4.0 ± 2.5 cm. Twenty-five (25.8%) were conservatively managed, 13 (13.4%) underwent surgery, and the rest were managed by radiosurgery (52.6%) or embolization (8.2%), with an obliteration rate of 38.9% in treated patients. During average follow-up of 5.4 years, 6 patients (6.7%) hemorrhaged yielding an annual hemorrhage rate of 1.2% for all patients, and 0.0% for surgically-treated patients. Thirty-seven (38.3%) patients experienced visual disturbance in some capacity, nineteen (21.1%) had de novo visual disturbance, fourteen of which were surgically treated patients (19.4%). Multivariable analysis reveals visual disturbance at presentation (p = .012) and microsurgery (p = .047) are significantly predictors of follow-up visual disturbance. While hemorrhage control remains the primary goal of AVM treatment, visual preservation in occipital AVMs is also a major concern. Recommending patients for microsurgery should be weighed carefully and individualized as it bears the highest risk of visual field disturbance despite most optimal hemorrhage control.",2018 Feb,2018,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society,48,,50-57,eng,False,S0967-5868(17)31224-9;10.1016/j.jocn.2017.10.058;S0967-5868(17)31224-9;10.1016/j.jocn.2017.10.058,Journal Article,"Adult;Aged;Cerebral Revascularization/methods;Clinical Decision-Making;Cohort Studies;Conservative Treatment;Embolization, Therapeutic;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/diagnostic;Intracranial Hemorrhages/diagnostic imaging/etiology;Male;Middle Aged;Neurosurgical Procedures;Postoperative Complications/epidemiology;Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Vision Disorders/etiology",Arteriovenous malformation;Occipital;Surgery;Visual disturbance
28681273,Delayed symptomatic haemorrhage from the remnants of a thalamic arteriovenous malformation after previous angiographic cure with radiotherapy.,"In 1995 a 16-year old girl was diagnosed with a large left thalamic AVM that was considered unsuitable for microsurgical resection and was treated with radiotherapy twice, which led to angiographic cure. She re-presented 19 years after initial treatment with a symptomatic acute thalamic haemorrhage. Her digital subtraction angiography was negative for arterio-venous shunting. MRI/MRA showed cystic change with adjacent contrast enhancement in the region of the previously irradiated arteriovenous malformation. The patient underwent an interhemispheric transcallosal resection of the left thalamic haemorrhagic lesion via a contralateral craniotomy. Intra-operatively there was a cystic cavity filled with blood products in association with thrombosed, calcified vessels as well as actively filling vessels. Histologically there were aggregated abnormal blood vessels with a dilated lumen and surrounded by brain parenchyma. Some of the vessel walls were thickened with fibrosis and some were arterialised with presence of elastin fibres.

22540403,"Nidal embolization of brain arteriovenous malformations: rates of cure, partial embolization, and clinical outcome.","OBJECT: Nidal embolization of brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) has become an increasingly important component of bAVM treatment. However, controversy exists as to the relative efficacy and safety of single-stage versus multistage approaches to bAVM embolization, with recent literature favoring multistage strategies. The authors present a series of consecutive bAVMs embolized at their institution, demonstrating the safety and efficacy of a predominantly single-stage embolization strategy. The safety and efficacy of embolization are reported in the context of predetermined treatment strategies to provide more generalizable insight into treatment outcome. METHODS: One hundred thirty consecutive patients with 131 bAVMs underwent endovascular embolization at a single center. Diagnostic angiography with superselective microcatheterizations was performed in all patients. Postembolization angiograms were reviewed by 3 neuroradiologists for degree of occlusion and angiographic evidence of procedural complications. Patients were divided into cohorts based on the prospectively determined treatment strategy, which included the following: global devascularization of the bAVM (Devasc); targeting of a focal angioarchitectural weakness (Target), typically as an adjunct to surgery or Gamma Knife treatment; and primary occlusion of the bAVM by embolization alone (Occlude). Safety and efficacy were evaluated in the context of these treatment groups. RESULTS: The 131 bAVMs were treated over an average of 1.28 embolization sessions per bAVM; 105 bAVMs (80%) were treated in a single stage. The average percentage devascularization in the Devasc arm was 85.3%, which was statistically significantly greater than the 72% aggregate devascularization reported in 8 modern N-butyl cyanoacrylate and Onyx papers based on 1-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum testing (p<0.001). Focal angioarchitectural weaknesses were successfully embolized for all 24 bAVMs in the Target group, directly with the embolic agent in 23 bAVMs and indirectly in 1 bAVM with a venous aneurysm/pseudoaneurysm by reducing arterial inflow and inducing venous thrombosis. Lesions in all patients in the Occlude arm were 100% occluded with embolization alone. Overall, the bAVMs in the Occlude arm were significantly smaller and required embolization of fewer pedicles than those in the Devasc group. One patient (0.8%) experienced significant morbidity following embolization, and 1 patient in the cohort died (0.8%). CONCLUSIONS: This research communicates the authors' experience in developing a largely single-stage strategy for embolization of bAVMs. The results suggest that an aggressive, single-stage embolization may be implemented with a margin of safety and effectiveness similar to the multistage approaches more commonly reported in the literature. This work additionally introduces the importance of prospective assignment to a treatment strategy in assessing procedural outcome in bAVM embolization, thereby improving generalizability of the results and allowing for more rigorous interpretation of efficacy and safety.",2012 Jul,2012,Journal of neurosurgery,117,1,65-77,eng,False,10.3171/2012.3.JNS111405;10.3171/2012.3.JNS111405,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Anesthesia, General;Catheterization/methods;Cerebral Angiography;Child;Combined Modality Therapy;Embolization, Therapeutic/adverse effects/*methods;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/classification/*therapy;Magnetic Resonance Angiography;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Neurologic Examination;Neurosurgical Procedures;Pain, Postoperative/drug therapy;Patient Care Planning;Postoperative Complications/epidemiology;Pregnancy;Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Tomography, X-Ray Computed;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",
12494356,Gamma knife radiosurgery in the management of arteriovenous malformations of the Basal Ganglia region of the brain.,"OBJECTIVES: The authors report the results of gamma knife (GK) radiosurgery on a clinical series of selected patients with basal ganglia arteriovenous malformations (BGAVMs) in the brain. Clinical, epidemiological, anatomical and functional characteristics of BGAVMs and of supratentorial cortical AVMs are comparatively analyzed, and their influence on radiosurgical outcome is discussed. METHODS: At our Department, 33 BGAVMs (21 with FU > 2 years) and 209 cortical AVMs (110 with FU > 2 years) with a radiosurgical volume </= 10 cc were treated with GK between February 1993 and July 2001. Mean age, male/female ratio (M/F), and incidence of haemorrhagic onset in the two subgroups of patients were as follows: 25.5 years (5 - 62 years), 16 M/17 F, and 30/33 (91%) in BGAVMs; 34.4 years (8 - 74 years), 124 M/85 F, and 107/209 (51%) in cortical AVMs. Statistical analysis performed using the contingency table method and deviance analysis according to generalized linear models showed that the differences in age and incidence of haemorrhagic onset were highly significant. RESULTS: The rates of complete obliteration, permanent morbidity, bleeding/rebleeding during the latency period, and unsuccessful embolisation attempts in the two subgroups of patients were as follows: 81%, 4%, 8%, and 41.7%, respectively, in BGAVMs; 85.5%, 2%, 2%, and 2% in cortical AVMs. Statistical analysis did not show any significant difference between the two subgroups of patients in the rates of complete obliteration, permanent morbidity, or latency period bleeding/rebleeding, while difference in failed embolization rates resulted to be highly significant (P = 0.00003). CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, the different clinical, epidemiological and anatomico-functional characteristics of BGAVMs and cortical AVMs do not seem to influence the radiosurgical outcome, since complete obliteration and permanent neurological sequelae rates were very similar in these two subgroups of patients. GK may be considered the first choice treatment modality for BGAVMs with < 10 cc volume, since it offers a very high cure rate, very low permanent morbidity, and zero mortality. Although haemorrhagic onset is much more frequent in BGAVMs than in cortical AVMs, the difference between the bleeding/rebleeding rates in the two subgroups of patients during the latency period is not statistically significant, and seems to be limited to the first year after GK.",2002 Dec,2002,Minimally invasive neurosurgery : MIN,45,4,211-23,eng,False,10.1055/s-2002-36200,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Basal Ganglia/*blood supply;Basal Ganglia Hemorrhage/diagnosis/surgery;Cerebral Angiography;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Postoperative Complications/diagnosis/etiology;*Radiosurgery;Recurrence",

METHODS AND MATERIALS: More than 250 treatments have been planned since 1993 using previously described standard SRS techniques for intracranial benign and malignant lesions. RESULTS: Five case studies are presented (1 meningioma, 1 acoustic neuroma, 2 solitary brain metastasis, 1 arteriovenous malformation), each of which demonstrates at least one salutary lesson. CONCLUSIONS: Because SRS delivers a highly conformal dose distribution, it is unforgiving of any geographic miss due to inaccurate outlining and thus dependent on neuroradiological expertise and collaboration.

Six patients presented with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) during pregnancy (first hemorrhagic episode); 2 patients presented with headache; and 1 patient with incidental detection of AVM. In the 3 patients with unruptured AVM, the diagnosis was made before pregnancy. In 3 of 6 patients who presented with ICH, AVM removal was performed during pregnancy. One patient required emergency surgery for the mass effect of the hematoma, and 2 patients with Spetzler-Martin grade I and II AVMs underwent elective surgery for the prevention of rebleeding. Radiosurgery for multiple AVMs was performed after delivery in one patient. Surgical resection and radiosurgery were performed after abortion in two patients. Of 3 patients with unruptured AVM, 2 patients became pregnant after radiosurgery and conservative treatment was initiated in 1 patient for Spetzler-Martin grade V AVM. Cesarean section was performed in 5 patients (one with severe uncontrollable pregnancy-induced hypertension) and vaginal delivery in 2 patients (one with grade V AVM). Delivery by obstetrical indication was possible in patients who underwent AVM resection during pregnancy. No rebleeding during pregnancy occurred.

15926707,Risk of hemorrhage from an arteriovenous malformation confirmed to have been obliterated on angiography after stereotactic radiosurgery.,"OBJECT: Radiosurgery has been widely adopted for the treatment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in which the practical endpoint is angiographic evidence of obliteration, presumed to be consistent with elimination of the risk of hemorrhage. To test this unverified assumption, the authors followed 236 radiosurgery-treated AVMs between 1 and 133 months (median 77 months) after angiographic evidence of obliteration. METHODS: Four patients experienced hemorrhage between 16 and 51 months after angiographic confirmation of AVM obliteration, and two underwent resection. The histological findings in these patients showed occlusion of the AVM by thickening of the intimal layer with dense hyalinization as well as a small amount of residual AVM vessels and a tiny vasculature. The risks of hemorrhage from these presumaby obliterated AVMs were 0.3% for the annual bleeding risk and 2.2% for the cumulative risk over 10 years. Continuous enhancement of the nidus on computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was the only significant factor positively associated with hemorrhage in the statistical analysis (p = 0.0212). CONCLUSIONS: Because the study was based on limited follow-up data, its significance for defining predictive features of hemorrhage after angiographic evidence of obliteration is still indeterminable. Nevertheless, disappearance of the AVM on angiography after radiosurgery does not always indicate total elimination of the disease, especially when CT or MR imaging continues to demonstrate an enhancing lesion. The authors therefore recommend continual follow up even after evidence of AVM obliteration on angiography.",2005 May,2005,Journal of neurosurgery,102,5,842-6,eng,False,10.3171/jns.2005.102.5.0842,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;*Cerebral Angiography;Cerebral Hemorrhage/diagnosis/*diagnostic imaging/etiology;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;*Radiosurgery;Tomography, X-Ray Computed;Treatment Outcome",

29125025,Choroid plexus AVM with anomalous origin of the capsulothalamic artery: A case report.,"Background and importance Traditionally, it has been believed that the plexal segment of the anterior choroidal artery (AChoA) can be sacrificed safely. Here, we present a case of choroid plexus arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in which the capsulothalamic artery originated from distal plexal segment of the AChoA. Clinical presentation A 45-year-old man was diagnosed with arteriovenous malformation involving the left inferior horn in screening MRI. Preceding stereotactic radiosurgery, transarterial target embolization was performed. In this procedure, 20% n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (NBCA) was successfully injected from the lateral plexal branch of the AChoA. After embolization, right homonymous hemianopsia developed due to cerebral infarction on the left optic radiation. This infarction was considered to be within the territory of the capsulothalamic artery. Conclusion This anomalous capsulothalamic artery might be formed by hemodynamic compromise of the brain surrounding AVM in early gestation.

22264181,Gamma Knife surgery for basal ganglia and thalamic arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECT: Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) has emerged as the treatment of choice for small- to medium-sized cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in deep locations. The present study aims to investigate the outcomes of GKS for AVMs in the basal ganglia and thalamus. METHODS: Between 1989 and 2007, 85 patients with AVMs in the basal ganglia and 97 in the thalamus underwent GKS and were followed up for more than 2 years. The nidus volumes ranged from 0.1 to 29.4 cm(3) (mean 3.4 cm(3)). The mean margin dose at the initial GKS was 21.3 Gy (range 10-28 Gy). Thirty-six patients underwent repeat GKS for residual AVMs at a median 4 years after initial GKS. The mean margin dose at repeat GKS was 21.1 Gy (range 7.5-27 Gy). RESULTS: Following a single GKS, total obliteration of the nidus was confirmed on angiograms in 91 patients (50%). In 12 patients (6.6%) a subtotal obliteration was achieved. No flow voids were observed on MR imaging in 14 patients (7.7%). Following single or repeat GKS, total obliteration was angiographically confirmed in 106 patients (58.2%) and subtotal obliteration in 8 patients (4.4%). No flow voids on MR imaging were observed in 18 patients (9.9%). The overall obliteration rates following one or multiple GKSs based on MR imaging or angiography was 68%. A small nidus volume, high margin dose, low number of isocenters, and no history of embolization were significantly associated with an increased rate of obliteration. Twenty-one patients experienced 25 episodes of hemorrhage in 850 risk-years following GKS, yielding an annual hemorrhage rate of 2.9%. Four patients died in this series: 2 due to complications of hemorrhage and 2 due to unrelated diseases. Permanent neurological deficits caused by radiation were noted in 9 patients (4.9%).

Rarely, some underlying diseases or disorders could be diagnosed, such as multiple sclerosis, brain tumors, and vascular malformations. The authors present a 47-year-old man with trigeminal neuralgia over left V2 and V3 dermatomes. He had a previous transarterial embolization and long use of carbamazepine with partial response to treatment. Gamma knife radiosurgery (GKR) was planned. A marginal dose of 15 Gy was given to 50% isodose line. His pain was relieved by GKR in 1.5 years. Treatment of posterior fossa arteriovenous malformations causing trigeminal neuralgia, with GKR has a very limited use in the literature.

11404714,[Hemorrhage after radiosurgery of cerebral arteriovenous malformations].,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Obliteration is progressive after radiosurgery of cerebral arteriovenous malformations. Thus the hemorrhage risk still remains until obliteration. Purposes of this study are to appreciate severity of post-radiosurgery hemorrhages, actuarial risk of hemorrhage and parameters associated with it. PATIENTS: and method. Over 705 patients treated, 46 (6.5%) had one or several hemorrhages. Clinical, anatomic, dosimetric parameters and obliteration rates before hemorrhage were studied. Then, actuarial risks per patient and per hemorrhage were calculated. Correlations between parameters and risk were searched by uni and multivariate analysis by drawing hemorrhage-free survival curves (limit-product Kaplan-Meier) and Cox model. RESULTS: Except one pure ventricular hemorrhage causing death of one patient, only parenchymal hemorrhages were associated with morbidity (80% of cases with 45% of permanent deficits). Overall mortality rate by hemorrhage was 6.5%. Overall morbidity rate was 34.8% and 13.6% for permanent deficit. Mean obliteration rate before hemorrhage was 25%. Actuarial hemorrhage rate were 2.98% per patient and 3.24% per hemorrhage. Actuarial rate per patient increased from 1.46% first year to 5.95% 4(th) year after radiosurgery. Parameters correlated with hemorrhage risk were in univariate analysis size (p=0.01), Spetzler and Martin's grade (p<0.001), dose to reference isodose (p=0.03), Dmin (p=0.08), intra or paranidal aneurysms (p<0.001), and recoverage (p<0.001). After multivariate analysis, only intra or paranidal aneurysms, recovering and Dmin were significantly associated with hemorrhage-free survival after RS.

20644425,Long-term outcomes of stereotactic radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations in the thalamus.,"BACKGROUND: Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in the thalamus carry a high risk of hemorrhage. Although stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is widely accepted because of the high surgical morbidity and mortality of these lesions, precise long-term outcomes are largely unknown. OBJECTIVE: To review our experience with SRS for thalamic AVMs based on the latest follow-up data. METHODS: Forty-eight patients with thalamic AVMs were treated by SRS using the Leksell Gamma Knife and were followed. Long-term outcomes including the obliteration rate, hemorrhage after treatment, and adverse effects were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The annual hemorrhage rate before SRS was 14%. The mean follow-up period after SRS was 66 months (range 6-198 months). The actuarial obliteration rate confirmed by angiography was 82% at 5 years after treatment, and the annual hemorrhage rate after SRS was 0.36%. Factors associated with higher obliteration rates were previous hemorrhage (P = .004) and treatment using new planning software (P = .001). Persistent worsening of neurological symptoms was observed in 17% and more frequently seen in patients who were treated using older planning software (P = .04) and a higher margin dose (P = .02). The morbidity rate for patients who received treatment planned using new software with a margin dose not more than 20 Gy was 12%. CONCLUSION: SRS for thalamic AVMs achieved a high obliteration rate and effectively decreased the risk of hemorrhage, with less morbidity compared with other modalities. Longer follow-up to evaluate the risk of delayed complications and the effort to minimize the morbidity is necessary.",2010 Aug,2010,Neurosurgery,67,2,398-403,eng,True,10.1227/01.NEU.0000371989.90956.6F;00006123-201008000-00030;10.1227/01.NEU.0000371989.90956.6F,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Kaplan-Meier Estimate;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Nervous System Diseases/etiology;Postoperative Complications/epidemiology;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects;Retrospective Studies;Thalamus/blood supply/*surgery;Tomography, X-Ray Computed;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",
38981563,Serum Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor and Endostatin as an Adjunct to Clinical Decision Making in Managing Radiation-induced Changes Post Gamma Knife Radiosurgery in Spetzler Martin Grade 3 Arteriovenous Malformations Patients: A Pilot Study.,"BACKGROUND: Radiation induced changes (RIC) are the most common complications observed post Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) and may be observed within 6-18 months post procedure. It has been observed that almost one-third of RICs are symptomatic and half of them are persistent. There is no way to predict which patients will develop these changes and to what extent. METHODS: This was a prospective analytical pilot study with the aim of understanding the role of serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and endostatin as predictive factors for clinically symptomatic RIC in intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of Spetzler Martin (SM) grade 3 being managed with primary GKRS. RESULTS: A total of 15 patients were analyzed; 60% of them had a history of bleed. The median volume of AVM nidus was 4.36 mL. One-third of the patients had no imaging changes suggestive of RIC at 1 year follow-up and 2 of the patients had symptomatic RIC needing intervention. Before GKRS, the median values of serum concentration of endostatin and VEGF were 34.98 ng/mL and 168.37 pg/mL, respectively. The serum values of VEGF at 1 month post GKRS was much lower than the pre-GKRS values but not found to be predictive of RIC. No correlation could be observed with the levels of serum endostatin and RIC. CONCLUSIONS: Some patients may develop resistant edema and necrosis post GKRS for intracranial AVMs, which may warrant medical and surgical intervention. Serum biomarkers like VEGF and endostatin may vary in the post GKRS period and can be used to identify at-risk cases, however more studies are needed to decide on appropriate time of sampling and identify clinically relevant predictive factors.",2024 Sep,2024,World neurosurgery,189,,e864-e871,eng,False,S1878-8750(24)01162-8;10.1016/j.wneu.2024.07.022;S1878-8750(24)01162-8;10.1016/j.wneu.2024.07.022,Journal Article,Humans;*Radiosurgery/methods;Pilot Projects;*Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/blood;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/radiotherapy/surgery/blood;Male;Female;*Endostatins/blood;Adult;Middle Aged;Prospective Studies;Young Adult;Clinical Decision-Making;Adolescent;Biomarkers/blood;Radiation Injuries/blood/etiology,Biomarkers;GKRS;Radiation induced changes;SM grade 3 AVMs

To evaluate late radiation effects in the brain after radiosurgery of patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and to quantify dose/volume-response relations for radiation-induced changes of brain tissue identified on follow-up neuroimaging. PATIENTS AND METHODS: . Data from 73 AVM patients who had stereotactic Linac radiosurgery at DKFZ (German Cancer Research Center), Heidelberg, Germany, were retrospectively analyzed. The endpoint of radiation-induced changes of brain tissue on follow-up magnetic resonance (MR) neuroimaging (i.e., edema and blood-brain-barrier breakdown [BBBB]) was evaluated. Each endpoint was further differentiated into three levels with respect to the extent of the image change (small, intermediate, and large). A previous analysis of the data found correlation of the endpoints with several dose/volume variables (DV) derived from each patient's dose distribution in the brain, including the mean dose in a volume of 20 cm(3) (Dmean20) and the absolute brain volume (including the AVM target) receiving a dose of at least 12 Gy (V12). To quantify dose/volume-response relations, patients were ranked according to DV (i.e., Dmean20 and V12) and classified into four groups of equal size. For each group, the actuarial rates of developing the considered endpoints within 2.5 years after radiosurgery were determined from Kaplan-Meier estimates. The dose/volume-response curves were fitted with a sigmoid-shape logistic function and characterized by DV(50), the dose for a 50% incidence, and the slope parameter k. RESULTS: . Dose/volume-response relations, based on two alternative, but correlated, dose distribution variables that are a function of both dose and volume, were observed for radiation-induced changes of brain tissue. DV(50) values of fitted dose/volume-response curves for tissue changes of large extent (e.g., V12(50) = 22.0 +/- 2.6 cm(3) and Dmean20(50) = 17.8 +/- 2.0 Gy for the combined endpoint of edema and/or BBBB) were significantly higher than those for small tissue changes (V12(50) = 4.0 +/- 0.3 cm(3) and Dmean20(50) = 7.6 +/- 0.3 Gy). CONCLUSION: . The derived dose/volume-response relations allow to quantitatively assess the risk of radiation-induced changes of brain tissue after radiosurgery in AVM patients. However, further understanding of the mechanism leading to brain tissue changes and their correlation with the desired obliteration is required. This knowledge will eventually help to optimize radiosurgical treatments in AVM patients.",2004 Dec,2004,Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ...

29483005,Clinical presentation and treatment paradigms of brain arteriovenous malformations in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.,"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is characterized by recurrent spontaneous epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectases, and multisystem arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Brain AVMs typically present at birth and are identified in approximately 10-20% of patients with HHT. A retrospective review was undertaken of all HHT patients with known single or multiple brain AVMs treated at our institution. Thirty-nine patients with brain AVM(s) were diagnosed with HHT. Most patients presented with at least one Curaçao criterion. A total of 78 brain AVMs were identified in 39 patients. Two-thirds of patients had solitary brain AVMs, whereas 33% of patients harbored at least two lesions (range: 2-16). Brain AVMs of the supratentorial cerebral hemispheres comprised 83% of all lesions, whereas infratentorial lesions accounted for only 17%. Of the 55 brain AVMs assigned Spetzler-Martin grading, the majority of patients were Grade 1 (73%), and 23% and 4% were Grades 2 and 3, respectively. Patients were treated with surgery alone (51%), embolization alone (6%), embolization followed by surgery (9%), stereotactic radiosurgery (11%), stereotactic radiosurgery followed by surgery (3%), or observation (20%). Of patients who underwent genetic analysis, 62% possessed mutations in ENG (HHT type 1), whereas 38% had mutations in ACVRL1 (HHT type 2).

Although microsurgery is the gold standard treatment to control the symptoms of CM, resection carries high risk in some situations, especially eloquent areas. The objective was to evaluate annual hemorrhage rates (AHRs) before and after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) treatment of cerebral CM in different locations. METHODS: A total of 195 patients (119 women and 76 men) with CM treated at the Gazi University Gamma Knife Center between April 2005 and June 2017 were analyzed. The mean ± SD follow-up period was 67.4 ± 31.1 months (range 12 days to 170 months). AHR before SRS, AHR after SRS, morbidity associated with radiation, seizure control rate after SRS, lesion volume, coexistence with developmental venous anomaly, and SRS treatment parameters were analyzed, with evaluation of radiological data and clinical charts performed retrospectively. The seizure control rate was assessed using the Engel outcome scale. RESULTS: The AHR before SRS was 15.3%. Application of SRS to these patients significantly reduced the AHR rates to 2.6% during the first 2 years after treatment and to 1.4% thereafter. Favorable seizure control (Engel class I and II) after radiosurgery was achieved in 23 patients (88.5%) with epilepsy. Radiation-related temporary complications occurred in 15.4% of patients, and permanent morbidity occurred in 4.6%.

METHODS: Prospective data collection for all patients undergoing microsurgical excision of unruptured brain AVMs by two neurovascular surgeons. Outcome measures similar to those assessed in the ARUBA trial (death and stroke) as well as modified Rankin scores (mRS) at 6 months were assessed. RESULTS: Between September 2004 and September 2014, 45 patients with unruptured brain AVMs underwent microsurgical excision. 11 patients (eight children and three with mRS >2 at presentation) were excluded to match ARUBA eligibility criteria. 34 patients were included in this study. AVM characteristics closely matched those in the ARUBA trial with 70.5% Spetzler-Martin (SM) grade I or II AVMs, 68% AVM size <3 cm. However, compared to ARUBA, a larger proportion of our patients presented with seizures, and a lower proportion with headaches. 8(23%) had preoperative embolization. There were no deaths and no strokes (as defined in ARUBA). 5 (14.7%) had permanent neurological deficit related to surgery within/near eloquent cortex. At 6 months follow-up, 32 (94%) had mRS score of 0-1. Two (6%) had mRS 2 and none had mRS> 2. Postoperative digital DSA confirmed complete AVM excision in all cases. None of the patients have suffered intracranial hemorrhage during the follow-up period of 6-126 (median 69) months. CONCLUSIONS: Microsurgical excision of unruptured brain AVMs can be performed with low morbidity in selected cases. Our study has limitations particularly the small number of patients with selected AVMs for microsurgical excision.

A case report.,"BACKGROUND: Brainstem venous congestion is a rare but serious complication of the CS-dAVF (cavernous sinus dural arteriovenous fistual). CASE DESCRIPTION: A 71-year-old woman presented with right abducens nerve palsy. Brain MRI showed a solitary lesion in the right upper pons. Cerebral angiogram revealed the right CS-dAVF with retrograde venous drainage into the cerebellar cortical veins and the anterior pontomesencephalic vein. The patient was treated with stereotactic radiosurgery, resulting in complete resolution of the pontine lesion and the neurologic symptom. CONCLUSION: A solitary brainstem lesion can be caused by CS-dAVF as a rare complication.

18401826,Frame-based stereotactic resection of subcentimeter arteriovenous malformations in deep or eloquent regions of the brain: indications and technique with eight consecutive operations.,"Subcentimeter arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) located in deep or eloquent cortex can be difficult to localize intraoperatively and safely remove with surgery. Nevertheless, surgical resection may be the optimal definitive treatment option available for select patients. In this communication, we describe our experience using a framed-based stereotactic approach for resecting these AVMs. The operative records of all AVMs treated at our institution over an 8-year period (1996-2004) were reviewed. 180 surgically treated AVMs were identified. From this group of patients, frame-based stereotaxy was used for 8 AVMs (4.4%) in 7 patients. The angiograms, operative reports, and medical records for these 7 patients were retrospectively reviewed with attention to neurological outcome, extent of AVM obliteration, and anatomic factors that impacted the decision to employ a frame-based stereotactic approach. All AVMs removed with this technique were less than 1 cm in diameter. Angiography confirmed complete resection in all cases. No new neurological deficits occurred in any patient. By providing highly accurate three-dimensional nidus localization and minimizing approach-related brain manipulation, frame-based stereotaxy reduces the morbidity associated with resection of subcentimeter AVMs located in deep or eloquent regions of the brain. This technique makes a definitive surgical cure available to patients who otherwise would only be considered for radiosurgery.",2008 Apr,2008,Minimally invasive neurosurgery : MIN,51,2,114-8,eng,False,10.1055/s-2007-1022532;10.1055/s-2007-1022532,Journal Article,"Adult;Brain/diagnostic imaging/*pathology/*surgery;Cerebral Angiography;Cerebral Arteries/pathology;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/*pathology/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Patient Selection;Retrospective Studies;Risk Assessment;Stereotaxic Techniques/*standards/statistics & numerical data;Tomography, X-Ray Computed;Treatment Outcome",

33227527,Magnetic Resonance Perfusion Changes of Arteriovenous Malformations Treated with Stereotactic Radiosurgery.,"BACKGROUND: The latency period from stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to obliteration of arteriovenous malformations (AVM) requires continuous imaging surveillance. Magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion is promising for noninvasive monitoring of AVMs after SRS. We studied longitudinal MR perfusion changes of brain AVMs treated with SRS. METHODS: Consecutive patients treated for brain AVMs using SRS who had MR perfusion imaging studies performed before and at least once after SRS were studied. We estimated ipsilateral/contralateral brain hemisphere ratios of MR perfusion indexes, including regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), in the AVM nidus, perinidal region, and remote anterior and posterior brain regions. RESULTS: Eleven patients (6 women; median age, 21 years) underwent SRS (median prescription dose, 18 Gy; range, 12-20 Gy) for brain AVMs (median Spetzler-Martin grade 2 and median volume 4.6 mL). Before the SRS, rCBV and rCBF ratios were significantly higher in the AVM nidus compared with other investigated brain regions (P < 0.001). Median time from SRS to the first and last post-SRS MR perfusion studies was 8 and 35 months, respectively. There was a statically significant decrease of rCBV (P = 0.043) and rCBF (P = 0.036) ratios in the AVM nidus, but not other brain regions, during post-SRS follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: There is a gradual decrease of rCBV and rCBF in the AVM nidus after SRS. MR perfusion imaging is promising for monitoring of hemodynamic changes of AVMs after SRS.

20059323,"Multidisciplinary care of occipital arteriovenous malformations: effect on nonhemorrhagic headache, vision, and outcome in a series of 135 patients. Clinical article.","OBJECT: In this study, the authors evaluated how an appropriate allocation of patients with occipital arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) who were treated according to different strategies would affect nonhemorrhagic headache, visual function, and hemorrhage risk levels. METHODS: Of the 712 patients with brain AVMs in the Toronto Western Hospital prospective database, 135 had occipital AVMs. The treatment decision was based on patients' characteristics, presentation, and morphology of the AVM. The management modalities were correlated with their outcomes. RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 6.78 years. Nonhemorrhagic headache was the most frequent symptom (82 [61%] of 135 patients). Ninety-four patients underwent treatment with one or a combination of embolization, surgery, or radiosurgery, and 41 were simply observed. Of the 40 nontreated patients with nonhemorrhagic headache, only 12 (30%) showed improvement. In the observation group 2 patients (22%) had worsening of visual symptoms, and 2 experienced hemorrhage, for an annual hemorrhage rate of 0.7% per year; 1 patient died. In the treatment group, the improvement in nonhemorrhagic headache in 35 patients (83%) was significant (p < 0.0001). Visual deficit at presentation worsened in 2 (8%), and there were 8 new visual field deficits (9%). The visual worsening was not significantly different. There were 2 other neurological deficits (2%) and 2 deaths (2%) related to the AVM treatment. One AVM hemorrhaged. The annual hemorrhage rate was 0.1% per year. The hemorrhage risk in the observation and treatment groups was lower than the observed hemorrhage risk of all patients with AVMs (4.6%) at the authors' institution. CONCLUSIONS: Appropriate selection of patients with occipital AVMs for one or a combination of treatment modalities yields a significant decrease in nonhemorrhagic headache without significant visual worsening.

18405778,[Superficial hemosiderosis of the central nervous system improved by corticosteroids].,"INTRODUCTION: Superficial siderosis is of the Central Nervous System (CNS) is an uncommon and often disabling disorder. There is no evidence that any treatment, including removal of an identified source of bleeding, affects disease progression. OBSERVATION: We report the case of a 49-year-old woman exhibiting progressive and various neurological disorders associating chorea, pyramidal syndrome, cerebellar ataxia, cognitive disorders and cranial nerve deficits. She had a prior history of right occipital arterioveinous malformation (AVM) revealed four years before by ventricular hemorrhage. The AVM was treated by radiosurgery. Because of a pronounced progression of the symptoms, treatment with steroid therapy was initiated before the diagnosis of siderosis of the central nervous system was asserted by magnetic resonance imaging (rim of hypo-intensity due to hemosiderin around the brainstem, the cerebellum and the spinal cord on T-2 weighted and gradient echo T-2* imaging) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination (high CSF levels of iron and ferritin). Over the next months the neurological condition improved under steroid therapy. CONCLUSION: Our observation is interesting because of the chorea movement disorders which are rarely reported in the disease and because of the improvement of the neurological condition after steroid therapy which is described in only another case in the literature.

32921513,Single- and Multifraction Stereotactic Radiosurgery Dose/Volume Tolerances of the Brain.,"PURPOSE: As part of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine Working Group on Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy investigating normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) after hypofractionated radiation therapy, data from published reports (PubMed indexed 1995-2018) were pooled to identify dosimetric and clinical predictors of radiation-induced brain toxicity after single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery (fSRS). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eligible studies provided NTCPs for the endpoints of radionecrosis, edema, or symptoms after cranial SRS/fSRS and quantitative dose-volume metrics. Studies of patients with only glioma, meningioma, vestibular schwannoma, or brainstem targets were excluded. The data summary and analyses focused on arteriovenous malformations (AVM) and brain metastases. RESULTS: Data from 51 reports are summarized. There was wide variability in reported rates of radionecrosis. Available data for SRS/fSRS for brain metastases were more amenable to NTCP modeling than AVM data. In the setting of brain metastases, SRS/fSRS-associated radionecrosis can be difficult to differentiate from tumor progression. For single-fraction SRS to brain metastases, tissue volumes (including target volumes) receiving 12 Gy (V12) of 5 cm(3), 10 cm(3), or >15 cm(3) were associated with risks of symptomatic radionecrosis of approximately 10%, 15%, and 20%, respectively. SRS for AVM was associated with modestly lower rates of symptomatic radionecrosis for equivalent V12. For brain metastases, brain plus target volume V20 (3-fractions) or V24 (5-fractions) <20 cm(3) was associated with <10% risk of any necrosis or edema, and <4% risk of radionecrosis requiring resection. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of radionecrosis after SRS and fSRS can be modeled as a function of dose and volume treated. The use of fSRS appears to reduce risks of radionecrosis for larger treatment volumes relative to SRS. More standardized dosimetric and toxicity reporting is needed to facilitate future pooled analyses that can refine predictive models of brain toxicity risks.",2021 May 1,2021,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",110,1,68-86,eng,False,S0360-3016(20)34101-8;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2020.08.013;S0360-3016(20)34101-8;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2020.08.013,Journal Article;Review,"Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use;Brain/pathology/*radiation effects;Brain Edema/etiology;Brain Neoplasms/*radiotherapy/secondary/surgery;Brain Stem/radiation effects;Disease Progression;Humans;Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors/therapeutic use;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*radiotherapy;Models, Biological;Models, Theoretical;Necrosis/diagnosis/etiology/pathology;Organs at Risk/pathology/*radiation effects;Probability;Radiation Dose Hypofractionation;Radiation Injuries/diagnosis/*etiology/pathology;Radiation Tolerance;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects/methods;Radiotherapy Dosage;Re-Irradiation",

18948717,"Radiosurgery for cavernous malformations in basal ganglia, thalamus and brainstem.","Long-term results of radiosurgery for cavernous malformations in basal ganglia and the brainstem are presented. Eighty-four cases, 50 males and 34 females, ranging in age from 10 to 68 years (mean: 38.2 years) are described. The lesions were located in the brainstem (63), thalamus (14) or basal ganglia (7). The mean lesion size was 14.3mm. Mean maximum and marginal treatment doses were 23.3 and 13.4 Gy, respectively. Brainstem lesions were significantly smaller than the lesions in basal ganglia and the thalamus. During a mean follow-up of 55 months, nearly half of the lesions showed some shrinkage, while in the other half there were no obvious changes. Only 4 of the 84 (4.8%) showed progression. Rebleeding occurred in 14 cases (16.7%),16 times in total. Among these, 12 hemorrhages occurred during the first 24 months after radiosurgery, and the incidence decreased markedly thereafter. Bleeding rates during the first and second years were 9.5 and 4.7%/year/case, respectively. However, the rate significantly decreased thereafter. As for complications, perifocal edema was seen in 18% of basal ganglia-thalamus and in 3.2% of brainstem lesion cases.

12535357,Analysis of factors predictive of success or complications in arteriovenous malformation radiosurgery.,"OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to determine which factors were statistically predictive of radiological and clinical outcomes in the radiosurgical treatment of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). METHODS: The computerized dosimetric and clinical data for 269 patients were reviewed. The AVM nidus was hand-contoured on successive enhanced computed tomographic slices through the nidus, to allow detailed determinations of nidus volume, target miss, normal brain tissue treated, dose conformality, and dose gradient. In addition, a number of patient and treatment factors, including Spetzler-Martin grade, presenting symptoms, dose, number of isocenters, radiological outcome, and clinical outcome, were subjected to multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-five patients were treated with radiosurgery for the first time, and 44 patients underwent radiosurgical retreatment. One hundred forty-three patients had AVMs located in or near ""eloquent"" brain areas and 126 patients did not. Seventy patients demonstrated preoperative neurological findings related to the AVM and 199 did not. Twenty-six patients had previously undergone endovascular treatment and 10 patients had previously undergone surgical treatment of their AVMs. Of the 269 patients studied, 228 experienced no complication, 10 (3.7%) experienced a transient radiation-induced complication, 3 (1%) experienced a permanent radiation-induced complication, and 28 (10%) experienced posttreatment hemorrhage. CONCLUSION: None of the analyzed factors was predictive of hemorrhage after radiosurgery in this study. The 12-Gy volume was predictive of permanent radiation-induced complications. Eloquent AVM location and 12-Gy volume were correlated with the occurrence of transient radiation-induced complications. Better conformality was correlated with a reduced incidence of transient complications.

19249934,Thrombosis and hemorrhage in the acute period following Gamma Knife surgery for arteriovenous malformation. Case report.,"Bleeding of an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a known risk during the latency interval, but hemorrhage in the 30-day period following radiosurgery rarely has been reported in the literature. The authors present the case of a 57-year-old man who underwent Gamma Knife surgery for a large AVM, and they provide radiographic documentation of a thrombus in the primary draining vein immediately preceding an AVM hemorrhage within 9 days after radiosurgery. They postulate that the pathophysiology of an AVM hemorrhage in the acute period following SRS is related to an association among tissue irradiation, acute inflammatory response, and vessel thrombosis. The authors also review the literature on risk factors for hemorrhage due to untreated and radiosurgically treated AVMs. Recent evidence on the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of AVMs and the pathophysiology of AVM rupture is presented. Inflammatory markers have been demonstrated in brain AVM tissue, and the association between inflammation and AVM hemorrhage has been established. There is an acute inflammatory response following tissue irradiation, resulting in structural and functional vascular changes that can lead to vessel thrombosis. Early hemorrhage following radiosurgical treatment of AVMs may be related to the acute inflammatory response and associated vascular changes that occur in irradiated tissue. In the first stage of a planned 2-stage Gamma Knife treatment for a large AVM in the featured case, the superior posteromedial portion of the primary draining vein was included in the treatment field. The authors present the planning images and subsequent CT scans demonstrating a new venous thrombus in the primary draining vein. An acute inflammatory response following radiosurgery with resultant acute venous thrombus formation and venous obstruction is proposed as one mechanism of an AVM hemorrhage in this patient. Radiographic evidence of the time course of thrombosis and hemorrhage supports the hypothesis that acute venous obstruction is a cause of intracranial hemorrhage.",2009 Jul,2009,Journal of neurosurgery,111,1,124-31,eng,False,10.3171/2009.1.JNS08784;10.3171/2009.1.JNS08784,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Acute Disease;Cerebral Angiography;Cerebral Hemorrhage/*diagnostic imaging;Cerebral Veins/diagnostic imaging;Fatal Outcome;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Intracranial Thrombosis/*diagnostic imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Postoperative Complications/*diagnostic imaging;*Radiosurgery;Tomography, X-Ray Computed",
10930007,Headaches in patients with radiosurgically treated occipital arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECT: The goal of this study was to determine the prevalence, characteristics, and radiosurgical outcomes of headaches associated with occipital arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). METHODS: The authors reviewed the medical records of 37 consecutive patients with occipital AVMs who had been treated by radiosurgery to identify the radiological features of the AVMs before and after treatment and the clinical features and outcomes of headaches described in accordance with the criteria of the International Headache Society (IHS). Thirty-six patients (97.3%) were followed for a mean period of 46.6 months. The median volume of the AVMs was 1.9 cm3, to which a mean radiation dose of 21.6 Gy was delivered. In the entire study group, periodic headaches were found in 17 patients (45.9%), of whom seven (18.9%) suffered from migraines with the characteristic visual aura. Migraine was predominantly found in patients with right-sided (p = 0.038) or laterally located (p = 0.025) AVMs. Factors associated with a higher incidence of any type of headache included larger nidus volume (p = 0.02), tortuous change of feeding artery (p = 0.036), and cortical drainage with reflux in the superior sagittal sinus (p = 0.032). The actuarial rate of angiographic obliteration was 71.6% at 3 years. Headaches resolved or improved in 12 (70.6%) of 17 patients, including six (85.7%) of seven with migraine. The outcome of headache closely correlated with the obliteration results of the AVM (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: A portion of occipital AVMs do cause headaches that satisfy the current IHS criteria for migraine, and the prevalence varies by the topography of the lesion.

33212272,Staged Surgical Resection of Brain Arteriovenous Malformations.,"BACKGROUND: Staged treatment of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is sometimes necessary to minimize risks associated with sudden changes in cerebral hemodynamics. With the increasing availability and optimization of endovascular techniques, multiple surgical resections are rarely necessary, although, due to specific anatomic circumstances, some AVMs still require staged surgery. Here, we describe the largest reported series of staged surgical resections of brain AVMs. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of surgically resected AVMs at a single institution from 1998-2018. Patients who underwent ≥2 resections within 1 year were reviewed. Only those in whom initial resection was terminated with intention for further resection were included in analysis. RESULTS: Twenty patients underwent deliberately staged resection from 1998-2018. Average age at treatment was 36.2 years (SD 16.5 years). Eleven patients (55%) were female, and 12 (60%) had left-sided AVMs. Median Spetzler-Martin grade was 4 (interquartile range [IQR]: 3-4). Average AVM nidus diameter was 5.0 cm (SD 1.7 cm). Seven patients (35%) presented with AVM rupture, and 12 (60%) presented with focal neurologic deficits without hemorrhage. Seventeen patients (85%) underwent preoperative embolization, median number of embolizations was 3 (IQR: 2-4). Three patients (15%) underwent preoperative radiosurgery. Median number of days between surgeries was 28 (IQR: 8-41 days).

31075392,Investigating the oxygenation of brain arteriovenous malformations using quantitative susceptibility mapping.,"Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are congenital vascular anomalies characterized by arteriovenous shunting through a network of coiled and tortuous vessels. Because of this anatomy, the venous drainage of an AVM is hypothesized to contain more oxygenated, arterialized blood than healthy veins. By exploiting the paramagnetic properties of deoxygenated hemoglobin in venous blood using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), we aimed to explore venous density and oxygen saturation (SvO(2)) in patients with a brain AVM. We considered three groups of subjects: patients with a brain AVM before treatment using gamma knife radiosurgery (GKR); patients three or more years post-GKR treatment; and healthy volunteers. First, we investigated the appearance of AVMs on QSM images. Then, we investigated whether QSM could detect increased SvO(2) in the veins draining the malformations. In patients before GKR, venous density, but not SvO(2), was significantly larger in the hemisphere containing the AVM compared to the contralateral hemisphere (p = 0.03). Such asymmetry was not observed in patients after GKR or in healthy volunteers. Moreover, in all patients before GKR, the vein immediately draining the AVM nidus had a higher SvO(2) than healthy veins. Therefore, QSM can be used to detect SvO(2) alterations in brain AVMs. However, since factors such as flow-induced signal dephasing or the presence of hemosiderin deposits also strongly affect QSM image contrast, AVM vein segmentation must be performed based on alternative MRI acquisitions, e.g., time of flight magnetic resonance angiography or T(1)-weighted images. This is the first study to show, non-invasively, that AVM draining veins have a significantly larger SvO(2) than healthy veins, which is a finding congruent with arteriovenous shunting.",2019 Oct 1,2019,NeuroImage,199,,440-453,eng,False,S1053-8119(19)30397-0;10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.05.014;S1053-8119(19)30397-0;10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.05.014,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Adolescent;Adult;Arteriovenous Fistula/*diagnostic imaging/radiotherapy;Cerebral Veins/*diagnostic imaging;Female;Follow-Up Studies;*Hemoglobins;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnostic imaging/radiotherapy;Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods;Male;Middle Aged;Neuroimaging/*methods;Oxygen/*blood;Radiosurgery;Young Adult,Arteriovenous malformation;Magnetic resonance imaging;Quantitative susceptibility mapping;Venous density;Venous oxygen saturation
15647577,The risk of hemorrhage after radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"BACKGROUND: Angiography shows that stereotactic radiosurgery obliterates most cerebral arteriovenous malformations after a latency period of a few years. However, the effect of this procedure on the risk of hemorrhage is poorly understood. METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study of 500 patients with malformations who were treated with radiosurgery with use of a gamma knife. The rates of hemorrhage were assessed during three periods: before radiosurgery, between radiosurgery and the angiographic documentation of obliteration of the malformation (latency period), and after angiographic obliteration. RESULTS: Forty-two hemorrhages were documented before radiosurgery (median follow-up, 0.4 year), 23 during the latency period (median follow-up, 2.0 years), and 6 after obliteration (median follow-up, 5.4 years). As compared with the period between diagnosis and radiosurgery, the risk of hemorrhage decreased by 54 percent during the latency period (hazard ratio, 0.46; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.26 to 0.80; P=0.006) and by 88 percent after obliteration (hazard ratio, 0.12; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.05 to 0.29; P<0.001). The risk was significantly reduced during the period after obliteration, as compared with the latency period (hazard ratio, 0.26; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.10 to 0.68; P=0.006). The reduction was greater among patients who presented with hemorrhage than among those without hemorrhage at presentation and similar in analyses that took into account the delay in confirming obliteration by means of angiography and analyses that excluded data obtained during the first year after diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Radiosurgery significantly decreases the risk of hemorrhage in patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations, even before there is angiographic evidence of obliteration. The risk of hemorrhage is further reduced, although not eliminated, after obliteration.",2005 Jan 13,2005,The New England journal of medicine,352,2,146-53,eng,True,352/2/146;10.1056/NEJMoa040907,Journal Article,Adult;Cerebral Angiography;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Incidence;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/*surgery;Intracranial Hemorrhages/epidemiology/etiology/*prevention & control;Male;Postoperative Complications/epidemiology/*prevention & control;Proportional Hazards Models;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Risk,
11369075,Treatment outcome of single or hypofractionated single-isocentric stereotactic irradiation (STI) using a linear accelerator for intracranial arteriovenous malformation.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We investigated the use of hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HFSR) to reduce adverse radiation effects in comparison to single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study includes 53 intracranial AVMs treated between 1991-1998. HFSR was selected for 26 AVMs with a maximum diameter > or 2.5 cm or at eloquent area. Twenty-seven patients were treated with SRS (18 AVMs < 2.5 cm at non-eloquent area, nine patients who were unfit for prolonged ring-wearing). The most frequent minimum dose (Dmin) was 20 Gy for SRS and 28 Gy for HFSR in four fractions. The mean follow-up duration was 34.6 months for SRS and 35.4 months for HFSR. RESULTS: As a whole, the 3 and 5-year actuarial obliteration rates were 64 and 92%. Age <20 years old (P=0.02) and a maximum diameter <2 cm were favorable factors (P=0.05). A difference in the distribution of patients was observed in size (> or =2.5 cm or not) (P<0.001) and location (eloquent or not) (P<0.001) between SRS and HFSR due to the treatment selection. However, no significant differences were observed in the actuarial rates of obliteration and transient increased signals with T2-weighted MR images between SRS and HFSR. Radiation necrosis occurred in two patients treated with SRS and in none with HFSR. Intracranial hemorrhage after treatment happened in two treated with SRS and three with HFSR. CONCLUSIONS: HFSR appears to be at least as effective as SRS in achieving complete obliteration of intracranial AVM, although its definitive role remains to be investigated.",2001 Jun,2001,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic,59,3,323-8,eng,False,S0167814001003036;10.1016/s0167-8140(01)00303-6,Comparative Study;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Arteriovenous Fistula/*congenital/*radiotherapy/*surgery;Child;Child, Preschool;Confidence Intervals;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*radiotherapy/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Particle Accelerators/*instrumentation;*Radiosurgery;Risk Factors;Treatment Outcome",
21293169,Surgical treatment for late complications following gamma knife surgery for arteriovenous malformations.,"BACKGROUND: To establish the surgical indications and strategy for late complications following gamma knife surgery (GKS) for arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). METHODS: Ten male and 7 female patients aged 17-52 years (mean 28.0 years) were retrospectively identified among 686 patients who underwent GKS for AVM at our hospital. Ten patients showed cyst formation (group A), 2 patients had expanding hematoma (group B), and 5 patients had both cyst and expanding hematoma (group C). RESULTS: The mean nidus volume was 10.1 ml (range 0.1-36 ml), and the mean prescription dose at the nidus margin was 19.9 Gy (range 18-28 Gy). Complete obliteration of the nidus was obtained in 12 patients, partial obliteration in 4, and no change in 1. Cyst formation (group A) was asymptomatic in 5 patients, and symptomatic in 5 patients, manifesting as headache, hemianopia, aphasia, and motor weakness. Expanding hematoma (groups B and C) was associated with surrounding brain edema and was symptomatic in all 7 patients. Cyst opening in 1 patient and placement of an Ommaya reservoir in 2 patients were necessary in group A. Both patients in group B underwent craniotomy. Four of the 5 patients in group C required craniotomy. Another patient in group C was lost to follow-up and the final outcome was unknown. CONCLUSIONS: Cyst formation is one of the late complications of GKS for AVM. Some cysts show spontaneous regression but others gradually increase in size and become symptomatic, although relatively large asymptomatic cysts are also known. Predicting the future course of a cyst is difficult. Surgery such as placement of an Ommaya reservoir should be considered for symptomatic cases. Expanding hematoma always increases in size and becomes symptomatic, so removal by craniotomy is necessary. Surrounding brain edema decreases rapidly after surgery and neurological symptoms quickly resolve.",2011,2011,Stereotactic and functional neurosurgery,89,2,96-102,eng,False,10.1159/000323543;000323543;10.1159/000323543,Case Reports;Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Brain Diseases/etiology/pathology/*surgery;Craniotomy;Cysts/etiology/pathology/*surgery;Female;Hematoma/etiology/pathology/*surgery;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Neurosurgical Procedures/instrumentation/*methods;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult,

12171335,Prediction of AVM obliteration after stereotactic radiotherapy using radiobiological modelling.,"This study was carried out in order to derive the radiobiological parameters of the dose-response relation for the obliteration of arteriovenous malformation (AVM) following single fraction stereotactic radiotherapy. Furthermore, the accuracy by which the linear Poisson model predicts the probability of obliteration and how the haemorrhage history, location and volume of the AVM influence its radiosensitivity are investigated. The study patient material consists of 85 patients who received radiation for AVM therapy. Radiation-induced AVM obliterations were assessed on the basis of post-irradiation angiographies and other radiological findings. For each patient the dose delivered to the clinical target volume and the clinical treatment outcome were available. These data were used in a maximum likelihood analysis to calculate the best estimates of the parameters of the linear Poisson model. The uncertainties of these parameters were also calculated and their individual influence on the dose-response curve was studied. AVM radiosensitivity was assumed to be the same for all the patients. The radiobiological model used was proved suitable for predicting the treatment outcome pattern of the studied patient material. The radiobiological parameters of the model were calculated for different AVM locations, bleeding histories and AVM sizes. The range of parameter variability had considerable effect on the dose-response curve of AVM. The correlation between the dosimetric data and their corresponding clinical effect could be accurately modelled using the linear Poisson model. The derived response parameters can be introduced into the clinical routine with the calculated accuracy assuming the same methodology in target definition and delineation. The known volume dependence of AVM radiosensitivity was confirmed. Moreover, a trend relating AVM location with its radiosensitivity was observed.",2002 Jul 21,2002,Physics in medicine and biology,47,14,2471-94,eng,False,10.1088/0031-9155/47/14/308,"Evaluation Study;Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Cerebral Arteries/abnormalities/surgery;Cerebral Veins/abnormalities/surgery;Child;Dose Fractionation, Radiation;*Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Models, Biological;*Models, Cardiovascular;Models, Statistical;Radiosurgery/*methods;Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted/*methods;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome",
19408991,Time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography imaging of a residual arteriovenous malformation nidus after Onyx embolization for stereotactic radiosurgery planning. Technical note.,"This report demonstrates that time-of-flight (TOF) MR angiography is a useful adjunct for planning stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) of large arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) after staged embolization with Onyx. Onyx (ethylene vinyl copolymer), a recently approved liquid embolic agent, has been increasingly used to exclude portions of large AVMs from the parent circulation prior to SRS. Limiting SRS to regions of persistent arteriovenous shunting and excluding regions eliminated by embolization may reduce unnecessary radiation doses to eloquent brain structures. However, SRS dosimetry planning presents unique challenges after Onyx embolization because it creates extensive artifacts on CT scans, and it cannot be delineated from untreated nidus on standard MR sequences. During the radiosurgery procedure, MR images were obtained using a GE Signa 1.5-T unit. Standard axial T2 fast spin echo high-resolution images (TR 3000 msec, TE 108 msec, slice thickness 2.5 mm) were generated for optimal visualization of brain tissue and AVM flow voids. The 3D TOF MR angiography images of the circle of Willis and vertebral arteries were subsequently obtained to visualize AVM regions embolized with Onyx (TR 37 msec, TE 6.9 msec, flip angle 20 degrees). Adjunct TOF MR angiography images demonstrated excellent contrast between nidus embolized with Onyx and regions of persistent arteriovenous shunting within a large AVM prior to SRS. Additional information derived from these sequences resulted in substantial adjustments to the treatment plan and an overall reduction in the treated tissue volume.",2009 May,2009,Neurosurgical focus,26,5,E13,eng,False,10.3171/2009.1.FOCUS08246;10.3171/2009.1.FOCUS08246,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Adult;Artifacts;Basilar Artery/diagnostic imaging/pathology/surgery;Brain Stem/blood supply/physiopathology;Dimethyl Sulfoxide/adverse effects/*therapeutic use;Embolization, Therapeutic/*methods;Female;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnostic imaging/pathology/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Angiography/*methods;Polyvinyls/adverse effects/*therapeutic use;Predictive Value of Tests;Preoperative Care/methods;Radiosurgery/*methods;Reoperation/methods;Secondary Prevention;Time Factors;Tomography, X-Ray Computed/methods",
24926653,Stereotactic radiosurgery for sylvian fissure arteriovenous malformations with emphasis on hemorrhage risks and seizure outcomes.,"OBJECT: Sylvian fissure arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) present substantial management challenges because of the critical adjacent blood vessels and functional brain. The authors investigated the outcomes, especially hemorrhage and seizure activity, after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) of AVMs within or adjacent to the sylvian fissure. METHODS: This retrospective single-institution analysis examined the authors' experiences with Gamma Knife surgery for AVMs of the sylvian fissure in cases treated from 1987 through 2009. During this time, 87 patients underwent SRS for AVMs in the region of the sylvian fissure. Before undergoing SRS, 40 (46%) of these patients had experienced hemorrhage and 36 (41%) had had seizures. The median target volume of the AVM was 3.85 cm(3) (range 0.1-17.7 cm(3)), and the median marginal dose of radiation was 20 Gy (range 13-25 Gy). RESULTS: Over a median follow-up period of 64 months (range 3-275 months), AVM obliteration was confirmed by MRI or angiography for 43 patients. The actuarial rates of confirmation of total obliteration were 35% at 3 years, 60% at 4 and 5 years, and 76% at 10 years. Of the 36 patients who had experienced seizures before SRS, 19 (53%) achieved outcomes of Engel class I after treatment. The rate of seizure improvement was 29% at 3 years, 36% at 5 years, 50% at 10 years, and 60% at 15 years. No seizures developed after SRS in patients who had been seizure free before treatment. The actuarial rate of AVM hemorrhage after SRS was 5% at 1, 5, and 10 years. This rate equated to an annual hemorrhage rate during the latency interval of 1%; no hemorrhages occurred after confirmed obliteration. No permanent neurological deficits developed as an adverse effect of radiation; however, delayed cyst formation occurred in 3 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic radiosurgery was an effective treatment for AVMs within the region of the sylvian fissure, particularly for smaller-volume AVMs. After SRS, a low rate of hemorrhage and improved seizure control were also evident.",2014 Sep,2014,Journal of neurosurgery,121,3,637-44,eng,True,10.3171/2014.5.JNS132244;10.3171/2014.5.JNS132244,Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Cerebral Angiography;Cerebral Hemorrhage/*epidemiology;Cerebral Veins/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Child;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Incidence;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*complications/diagnostic;Kaplan-Meier Estimate;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Risk Factors;Seizures/*epidemiology;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult,AVM = arteriovenous malformation;Gamma Knife;SRS = stereotactic radiosurgery;arteriovenous malformation;epilepsy;seizure;stereotactic radiosurgery;sylvian fissure;vascular disorders

16528197,Stereotactic radiosurgery of the rete mirabile in swine: a longitudinal study of histopathological changes.,"OBJECTIVE: Stereotactic radiosurgery is an established, effective treatment for brain arteriovenous malformations. The mechanisms of vessel occlusion in arteriovenous malformations has not been extensively evaluated. To better understand these mechanisms, we report histopathological changes in the swine rete mirabile after stereotactic radiosurgery. METHODS: Thirty-five swine were used, 15 as nonradiated controls and 20 as radiated. Two in the control group and five in the radiated group were sacrificed before the study endpoint. Tissue was obtained from 13 nonradiated (4 at 3 mo, 5 at 6 mo, 4 at 9 mo) and 15 radiated swine (2 at 3 mo, 3 at 6 mo, 10 at 9 mo) for histological, immunohistochemical, and morphometric analysis. RESULTS: Radiated vessels showed increasing intimal hyperplasia over the follow-up period. Histometrical analysis confirmed this with evidence of progressive luminal narrowing over the follow-up period. Immunohistochemical analysis showed intimal cells to be proliferating smooth muscle cells with surrounding extracellular collagen Type IV. Adventitial fibrosis composed of collagen Type IV was also seen with smooth muscle cells interspersed within the collagen matrix. The nonradiated animals showed no intimal hyperplasia or change in the appearance or size of the vessels over the same follow-up period. Adventitial fibrosis was minimal in the nonradiated animals. CONCLUSION: The vessels show an intimal response to radiation with progressive occlusion caused by migrating, proliferating smooth muscle cells, a likely source of the extracellular collagen in the intima. Cytokine mediated pathways likely produce these morphological changes. Future studies will be directed toward elucidating these underlying molecular mechanisms.",2006 Mar,2006,Neurosurgery,58,3,551-8; discussion 551-8,eng,False,00006123-200603000-00018;10.1227/01.NEU.0000197335.93538.BD,"Comparative Study;Journal Article;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural","Animals;Brain/*blood supply/*pathology;Carotid Artery, Internal/pathology;Female;Longitudinal Studies;Male;Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/*pathology;Radiosurgery/adverse effects/*methods;Swine",
22208314,Arteriovenous malformation-associated aneurysms in the pediatric population.,"OBJECT: Conventional cerebral angiography and treatment for ruptured arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in children are often performed in a delayed fashion. In adults, current literature suggests that AVM-associated aneurysms may be more likely to hemorrhage than isolated AVMs, which often leads to earlier angiography and endovascular treatment of associated aneurysms. The nature of AVM-associated aneurysms in the pediatric population is virtually unknown. In this report, the authors investigate the relationship of associated aneurysms in a large group of children with AVMs. METHODS: Seventy-seven pediatric patients (≤ 21 years old) with AVMs were treated at the Columbia University Medical Center between 1991 and 2010. Medical records and imaging studies were retrospectively reviewed, and associated aneurysms were classified as arterial, intranidal, or venous in location. Clinical presentation and outcome variables were compared between children with and without AVM-associated aneurysms. RESULTS: A total of 30 AVM-associated aneurysms were found in 22 children (29% incidence). Eleven were arterial, 9 intranidal, and 10 were venous in location. There was no significant difference in the rate of hemorrhage (p = 0.91) between children with isolated AVMs (35 of 55 [64%]) and children with AVM-associated aneurysms (13 of 22 [59%]). However, of the 11 children with AVM-associated aneurysms in an arterial location, 10 presented with hemorrhage (91%). An association with hemorrhage was significant in univariate analysis (p = 0.045) but not in multivariate analysis (p = 0.37). CONCLUSIONS: Associated aneurysms are present in nearly a third of children with AVMs, and when arterially located, are more likely to present with hemorrhage. These data suggest that early angiography with endovascular treatment of arterial-based aneurysms in children with AVMs may be indicated.",2012 Jan,2012,Journal of neurosurgery.

25439748,Predictors of functional outcome following treatment of posterior fossa arteriovenous malformations.,"Posterior fossa arteriovenous malformations (AVM) present particular therapeutic challenges. Studies aimed at clarifying risk of hemorrhage focus on obliteration rates, but few have addressed functional outcomes in these patients. In this study, we aim to explore the predictors of good functional outcome for posterior fossa AVM after treatment. A retrospective review of patients diagnosed with posterior fossa AVM at our institution from 1990 to 2013 was performed, and 61 patients met the inclusion criteria. Functional outcomes were assessed using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), and mRS ⩽ 1 was defined as good outcome. Within our cohort, 39 patients presented with hemorrhage (64.0%). Spetzler-Martin grades were I (n = 9, 14.8%), II (n = 20, 32.8%), III (n = 22, 36.1%), IV (n = 8, 13.1%), and V (n = 2, 3.3%). Patients were treated with surgery (n = 8), radiosurgery (n = 34), embolization (n = 2) or multimodal therapies (n = 8). Nine patients did not undergo treatment. Average follow-up was 41.9 months. Obliteration of AVM was confirmed in 44.3% of patients (n = 27). Forty-three patients (70.5%) achieved good functional outcomes (mRS ⩽ 1). The absence of pre-treatment symptoms (p < 0.01) and AVM obliteration (p = 0.04) were predictive of good functional outcomes. In contrast, non-hemorrhagic presentation was not a significant predictor (p = 0.60). Asymptomatic presentation and AVM obliteration are associated with good functional outcomes in patients with posterior fossa AVM. Non-hemorrhagic presentation does not necessarily predict good functional outcome. Therefore treatment should not be considered only for those who present with hemorrhage. Posterior fossa AVM should be considered for definitive treatment in order to prevent future hemorrhages and subsequent poor functional outcomes.",2015 Feb,2015,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society,22,2,357-62,eng,False,S0967-5868(14)00555-4;10.1016/j.jocn.2014.08.007;S0967-5868(14)00555-4;10.1016/j.jocn.2014.08.007,Journal Article,"Adult;Cohort Studies;Combined Modality Therapy;Cranial Fossa, Posterior/pathology/*surgery;Embolization, Therapeutic;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/surgery/*therapy;Intracranial Hemorrhages/etiology/surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Neurosurgical Procedures/methods;Predictive Value of Tests;Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Rupture/surgery;Treatment Outcome",AVM obliteration;Arteriovenous malformations;Functional outcome;Intracranial hemorrhage;Posterior fossa
11404715,[Evolution of epileptic seizures associated with cerebral arteriovenous malformations after radiosurgery].,"The goal of this study is to evaluate the response of epileptic seizures associated with cerebral arteriovenous malformations following radiosurgery and determine the factors associated with a positive outcome. The series included 210 patients (123 men, 87 women) with a mean age of 33. One hundred seventy three patients out of 210 were controlled after radiosurgery. Seizures completely disappeared in 58% of cases and decreased in 18%. Anti-epileptic treatment was stopped in 44%. Sex and age upon seizure appearance were not found as determining factors in patients whose seizures disappeared after radiosurgery. Generalized seizures disappeared following radiosurgery in 90.7%, partial secondary generalized seizures in 53.5%, and partial seizures in only 39.6%. Frontal or temporal malformations are associated with a better response after radiosurgery than sylvian or rolandic location. Seizure disappearance was maximal in case of isolated seizure prior to the radiosurgery (84.4%), was reduced to 61.2% when seizures were limited to 2 to 20, and disappeared in 21.4% in severe seizures. Epilepsy present less than 3 years prior to radiosurgery disappeared in 71.9%; was reduced to 45% when the delay was over 3 years. Seizures disappeared in 64.4% when the malformation was obliterated, they were reduced to 46.9% when malformations persisted. The persistence of severe seizures following radiosurgery was linked to persistence of the malformation. On the other hand early seizures occurred in 3.3% during the first 48 hours following radiosurgery; they disappeared in 72.2% after that period. De novo seizures also occurred in 1.7% and disappeared in all these cases. In conclusion, seizures associated with cerebral arteriovenous malformations respond well to radiosurgery; the malformation obliteration evokes its association with the seizure; the seizure disappearance in spite of persistence of the malformation evokes the positive effect of radiotherapy on epileptic seizures.",2001 May,2001,Neuro-Chirurgie,47,2-3 Pt 2,344-9,fre,False,75764,English Abstract;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use;Child;Epilepsies, Partial/drug therapy/epidemiology/etiology;Epilepsy/classification/drug therapy/epidemiology/*etiology;Epilepsy, Generalized/drug therapy/epidemiology/etiology;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Incidence;Intracranial Arteriovenous;Male;Middle Aged;Paris/epidemiology;Postoperative Complications/drug therapy/epidemiology/*etiology;Prognosis;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects;Remission, Spontaneous;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome",

This review provides an overview of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, natural history, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of AVMs. The authors discussed the imaging techniques available for detecting AVMs with regard to the advantages and disadvantages of each imaging modality. Furthermore, this review paper discusses the factors that must be considered for the most appropriate management strategy (based on the current evidence in the literature) and the risks and benefits of each management option.",2014,2014,TheScientificWorldJournal,2014,,649036,eng,False,10.1155/2014/649036;649036;10.1155/2014/649036,Journal Article;Review,Blood Vessels/*physiopathology;Brain/blood supply/physiopathology;Cerebral Angiography;Disease Management;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic;Intracranial Hemorrhages/diagnostic;Neurosurgical Procedures;Radiosurgery;Vascular Surgical Procedures,
25423270,Stereotactic radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations of the postgeniculate visual pathway.,"OBJECT: A visual field deficit resulting from the management of an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) significantly impacts a patient's quality of life. The present study was designed to investigate the clinical and radiological outcomes of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) performed for AVMs involving the postgeniculate visual pathway. METHODS: In this retrospective single-institution analysis, the authors reviewed their experience with Gamma Knife surgery for postgeniculate visual pathway AVMs performed during the period between 1987 and 2009. RESULTS: During the study interval, 171 patients underwent SRS for AVMs in this region. Forty-one patients (24%) had a visual deficit prior to SRS. The median target volume was 6.0 cm3 (range 0.4-22 cm3), and 19 Gy (range 14-25 Gy) was the median margin dose. Obliteration of the AVM was confirmed in 80 patients after a single SRS procedure at a median follow-up of 74 months (range 5-297 months). The actuarial rate of total obliteration was 67% at 4 years. Arteriovenous malformations with a volume<5 cm3 had obliteration rates of 60% at 3 years and 79% at 4 years. The delivered margin dose proved significant given that 82% of patients receiving ≥22 Gy had complete obliteration. The AVM was completely obliterated in an additional 18 patients after they underwent repeat SRS. At a median of 25 months (range 11-107 months) after SRS, 9 patients developed new or worsened visual field deficits. One patient developed a complete homonymous hemianopia, and 8 patients developed quadrantanopias. The actuarial risk of sustaining a new visual deficit was 3% at 3 years, 5% at 5 years, and 8% at 10 years. Fifteen patients had hemorrhage during the latency period, resulting in death in 9 of the patients. The annual hemorrhage rate during the latency interval was 2%, and no hemorrhages occurred after confirmed obliteration. CONCLUSIONS: Despite an overall treatment mortality of 5%, related to latency interval hemorrhage, SRS was associated with only a 5.6% risk of new visual deficit and a final obliteration rate close to 80% in patients with AVMs of the postgeniculate visual pathway.",2015 Feb,2015,Journal of neurosurgery,122,2,433-40,eng,True,10.3171/2014.10.JNS1453;10.3171/2014.10.JNS1453,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Geniculate Bodies/*radiation effects;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Kaplan-Meier Estimate;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects;Retrospective Studies;Risk Factors;Treatment Outcome;Vision Disorders/*epidemiology/physiopathology;Visual Fields/physiology/radiation effects;Visual Pathways/physiopathology/*radiation effects;Young Adult",ARE = adverse radiation effect;AVM;AVM = arteriovenous malformation;Gamma Knife;SRS = stereotactic radiosurgery;arteriovenous malformation;optic radiation;stereotactic radiosurgery;vascular disorders;vision

28328005,Incidence and Management of Late Adverse Radiation Effects After Arteriovenous Malformation Radiosurgery.,"BACKGROUND: Late adverse radiation effects (ARE) typically occur many years after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) of intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVM). They are characterized by perilesional edema or cyst formation and are distinct from radiation-induced changes (RIC) noted in the first 1 to 2 years after AVM SRS and radiation necrosis. OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of late ARE after AVM SRS. METHODS: Retrospective review of 233 AVM patients having SRS from 1990 to 2009. Patients had sporadic AVM, no prior radiation, and a minimum of 5 years of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) follow-up. The median MRI follow-up after SRS was 9.8 years (range, 5-24.2). RESULTS: Late ARE were observed in 16 patients (6.9%) at a median of 8.7 years after SRS (range, 2.0-16.1). The 5-, 10-, and 15-year incidence of late ARE was 0.4%, 7.7%, and 12.5%, respectively. Eight patients (3.4%) were symptomatic at the time of ARE detection. Three of 8 patients who were initially asymptomatic had documented cyst progression (at 11, 40, and 42 months), for an overall symptomatic rate of 4.7%. Five patients with asymptomatic ARE have been observed for a median of 9.3 years (range, 2.0-14.1) without progression. Patients having early RIC (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.11, P < .001), patients having obliteration (HR = 1.24, P = .02), and patients having SRS before April 1997 (HR = 1.12, P = .02) were more likely to develop late ARE. CONCLUSION: Late ARE are common in AVM patients who develop early RIC after SRS. Resection of the thrombosed AVM and the adjacent damaged tissue is effective at eliminating the mass effect and improving patients' neurological condition.",2017 Dec 1,2017,Neurosurgery,81,6,928-934,eng,False,10.1093/neuros/nyx010;3048645;10.1093/neuros/nyx010,Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Arteriovenous Fistula/*surgery;Disease Progression;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Incidence;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Radiation Injuries/*epidemiology/etiology/therapy;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects;Retrospective Studies;Time Factors;Treatment Outcome,Arteriovenous malformation;Complication;Cyst;Edema;Radiosurgery
21561563,Endovascular treatment of intracranial ruptured aneurysms associated with arteriovenous malformations: a clinical analysis of 14 hemorrhagic cases.,"This study investigated and summarized endovascular therapeutic strategies for intracranial ruptured aneurysms associated with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Between June 2005 and June 2009, we identified 16 aneurysms in 14 hemorrhagic cases of intracranial AVM using digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Of the 16 aneurysms, 14 were ruptured and two were unruptured. Aneurysms were classified as types I to IV, and were treated. Aneurysm treatment was followed by AVM treatment via various therapies, including embolization, gamma knife radiotherapy, or follow-up and observation to reduce the risk of aneurysm rupture or intracranial hemorrhage. Over a follow-up period ranging from six months to one year, none of the patients had aneurysm ruptures or intracranial hemorrhage. Most (13/14) patients had a Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score of 5, and one patient had a score of 4. Sixteen aneurysms were treated successfully, as confirmed by DSA examination, and no AVMs re-grew. Clinical therapeutic strategies for intracranial ruptured aneurysms associated with AVMs should include aneurysm treatment first to reduce the risk of rupture and intracranial hemorrhage, eventually leading to a better prognosis.",2011 Mar,2011,"Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology,",17,1,78-86,eng,False,IN.v17.i1.p78;10.1177/159101991101700113,Journal Article,"Adult;Aneurysm, Ruptured/diagnostic imaging/surgery/*therapy;Cerebral Angiography;Cerebral Hemorrhage/therapy;Combined Modality Therapy;*Embolization, Therapeutic;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Aneurysm/diagnostic imaging/surgery/*therapy;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/surgery/*therapy;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",

However, their familial occurrence has so far been described in only 19 families in the literature. The authors report on two cases in one family and review the literature. A 45-year-old female subject with sudden onset of headache and vomiting due to a subarachnoid haemorrhage from a small AVM in the posterior part of the corpus callosum near the midline on the left side was studied. Irradiation of the AVM using Leksell's gamma knife led to its complete obliteration. Her older sister presented with temporal seizures at the age of 49 and later also with left hemiparesis, left hemihypaesthesia and dizziness - caused by a large AVM in the right temporal lobe.

18580811,Radiation arteriopathy in the transgenic arteriovenous fistula model.,"OBJECTIVE: The transgenic arteriovenous fistula model, surgically constructed with transgenic mouse aorta interposed in common carotid artery-to-external jugular vein fistulae in nude rats, has a 4-month experimental window because patency and transgenic phenotype are lost over time. We adapted this model to investigate occlusive arteriopathy in brain arteriovenous malformations after radiosurgery by radiating grafted aorta before insertion in the fistula. We hypothesized that high-dose radiation would reproduce the arteriopathy observed clinically within the experimental time window and that deletions of endoglin (ENG) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) genes would modify the radiation response. METHODS: Radiation arteriopathy in the common carotid arteries of 171 wild-type mice was examined with doses of 25, 80, 120, or 200 Gy (Experiment 1). Radiation arteriopathy in 68 wild-type arteriovenous fistulae was examined histologically and morphometrically with preoperative radiation doses of 0, 25, or 200 Gy (Experiment 2). Radiation arteriopathy in 51 transgenic arteriovenous fistulae (36 ENG and 15 eNOS knock-out fistulae) was examined using preoperative radiation doses of 0, 25, or 200 Gy (Experiment 3). RESULTS: High-dose radiation (200 Gy) of mouse common carotid arteries induced only mild arteriopathy (mean score, 0.66) without intimal hyperplasia and with high mortality (68%). Radiation arteriopathy in wild-type arteriovenous fistulae was severe (mean score, 3.5 at 200 Gy), with intimal hyperplasia and medial disruption at 3 months, decreasing luminal areas with increasing dose, and no mortality. Arteriopathy was robust in transgenic arteriovenous fistulae with ENG +/- and with eNOS +/-, with thick intimal hyperplasia in the former and distinct smooth muscle cell proliferation in the latter. CONCLUSION: The transgenic arteriovenous fistula model can be adapted to rapidly reproduce radiation arteriopathy observed in resected brain arteriovenous malformations after radiosurgery. High radiation doses accelerate the progression of arteriopathy to fit the 4-month time limitation of the model, allowing transgenic tissues to retain their phenotypes throughout the experimental window. Modified radiation responses in ENG and eNOS knock-out fistulae indicate that arteriopathy after arteriovenous malformation radiosurgery might potentially be enhanced by altered gene expression.",2008 May,2008,Neurosurgery,62,5,1129-38; discussion 138-9,eng,False,10.1227/01.neu.0000325875.82999.3c;00006123-200805000-00015;10.1227/01.neu.0000325875.82999.3c,"Journal Article;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural","Animals;Aorta/radiation effects/transplantation;Arteriovenous Fistula/*surgery;Carotid Arteries/*radiation effects/surgery;Disease Models, Animal;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Jugular Veins/*radiation effects/surgery;Mice;Mice, Transgenic;*Radiosurgery;Rats;Rats, Nude",
12587393,[Intracerebral radiotherapy under stereotaxic conditions].,"Stereotactic radiosurgery is used for treating several brain diseases. Radiosurgery is a non-invasive alternative to surgery for brain metastases, and randomized trials are on going to assess the role of radiosurgery. Radiosurgery has been advocated for patients with small benign meningioma or with vestibular schwannoma, but there is no proof of efficacy and safety of radiosurgery in comparison with other treatments. Radiosurgery can obliterate 80-90% of small arteriovenous malformations, but no information exists on the survival of treated compared with untreated patients.

19028763,Management and clinical outcome of posterior fossa arteriovenous malformations: report on a single-centre 15-year experience.,"OBJECTIVES: Posterior fossa brain arteriovenous malformations (PFbAVMs) are rare lesions. Management is complicated by eloquence of adjacent neurological structures, multimodality treatment is often necessary, and obliteration is not always possible. We describe a 15-year experience in the management of posterior fossa brain AVMs with a focus on clinical outcome. METHODS: From 1989 to 2004, prospectively collected information on 106 patients with diagnosis of a PFbAVMs was obtained. Clinical and angioarchitectural characteristics, management options and complications are described and reviewed to evaluate their impact on final outcome as measured by the Modified Rankin Score (mRS). RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients were followed for an average of 3.3 years (1-14.6). The male-to-female ratio was 1:1. Ninety-five out of 98 patients (96.9%) were symptomatic at presentation, with 61 (62.2%) intracranial haemorrhages. Sixty-two patients were treated (46 cerebellar, 16 brainstem). Ten haemorrhages occurred in follow-up (4.1%/year). The mRS was obtained in 62 patients and was classified as low (good, mRS<or=2) or high (poor, mRS>or=3). Haemorrhage was the only predictor of poor mRS at presentation (p = 0.0229). A poor clinical outcome was correlated with the presence of AA (p = 0.0276), a poor initial mRS (p<0.0001) and the number of treatments needed (p = 0.0434). Patients were significantly more likely to improve than to deteriorate over time (p = 0.0201). CONCLUSION: The final clinical outcome in PFbAVMs relates directly with the presence of associated aneurysms, number of treatments needed to obliterate the AVM and mRS at presentation. Despite the fact that patients tend to improve after brain AVM haemorrhage, the relationship of MRS at presentation and final outcome suggests that an expedited, more definitive treatment is probably a better choice, especially in patients with good grades after the initial bleeding.",2009 Apr,2009,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",80,4,376-9,eng,False,10.1136/jnnp.2008.152710;jnnp.2008.152710;10.1136/jnnp.2008.152710,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Analysis of Variance;Cerebral Angiography;Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology;Child;Child, Preschool;Cranial Fossa, Posterior/*pathology/surgery;Embolization, Therapeutic;Female;Humans;Infant;Intracranial Aneurysm/etiology/pathology;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/pathology/surgery/*therapy;Male;Middle Aged;Neurosurgical Procedures;Prospective Studies;Radiosurgery;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",

The treatment of both TN and AVM can be challenging, especially if the AVM is embedded within the trigeminal nerve. A persistent trigeminal artery (PTA) can rarely supply these intrinsic trigeminal nerve AVM. We present a 64-year-old man with TN from a right trigeminal nerve AVM supplied by a PTA variant. The patient underwent microvascular decompression and a partial resection of the AVM with relief of facial pain symptoms. His residual AVM was subsequently treated with CyberKnife radiosurgery (Accuray, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). A multimodality approach may be required for the treatment of trigeminal nerve associated PTA AVM and important anatomic patterns need to be recognized before any treatment.

17367070,Inhibition of angiogenesis induced by cerebral arteriovenous malformations using gamma knife irradiation.,"OBJECT: The authors studied the effect of Gamma Knife irradiation on angiogenesis induced by cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) tissues implanted in the corneas of rats. METHODS: Ten AVM specimens obtained from tissue resections performed at Marmara University between 1998 and 2004 were used. A uniform amount of tissue was implanted into the micropocket between the two epithelial layers of the cornea. Gamma Knife irradiation was applied with dose prescriptions of 15 or 30 Gy to one cornea at 100% isodose. Dosing was adjusted so that the implanted cornea of one eye received 1.5 Gy when 15 Gy was applied to the other cornea. Similarly, one cornea received 3 Gy when 30 Gy was applied to the other cornea. Angiogenic activity was graded daily by biomicroscopic observations. Forty-eight other rats were used for microvessel counting and vascularendothelial growth factor (VEGF) staining portions of the experiment. Micropieces of the specimens were again used for corneal implantation. Rats from each group were killed on Days 5, 10, 15, and 20, and four corneas from each group were examined. Gamma Knife irradiation dose dependently decreased AVM-induced neovascularization in the rat cornea as determined by biomicroscopic grading of angiogenesis, microvessel count, and VEGF expression. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that Gamma Knife irradiation inhibits angiogenesis induced by AVM tissue in the cornea angiogenesis model. The data are not directly related to understanding how Gamma Knife irradiation occludes existing AVM vasculature, but to understanding why properly treated AVMs do not recur and do not show neovascularization after Gamma Knife irradiation.",2007 Mar,2007,Journal of neurosurgery,106,3,463-9,eng,False,10.3171/jns.2007.106.3.463,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adult;Animals;Brain/blood supply;Corneal Neovascularization/etiology/metabolism/*prevention & control;Disease Models, Animal;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*complications/metabolism/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Neovascularization, Pathologic/etiology/metabolism/prevention & control;*Radiosurgery;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism",
11404706,[Radiosurgery of choroidal and cisternal cerebral arteriovenous malformations].,"PURPOSE: Cerebral arteriovenous malformations surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid seemed to exhibit worse response to radiosurgery than others. We searched to verify if this is was true and to find causes. MATERIAL: and methods. From our series of 705 patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations treated by radiosurgery, 3,8% (27/705) had choroidal or cisternal arteriovenous malformations. Revelation mode was hemorrhage in 86% of cases but sometimes headaches occurred before hemorrhage; thus overall hemorrhage rate was 96%. Mean age of revelation was 24. Mean size was 20 mm, mean volume was 4 cc. Spetzler & Martin's grades were 35% in grade II, 43% in grade III and 22% in grade IV. Location was ventricular in 63% of cases and cisternal in 37%. Mean dose at reference isodose was 24 Gy with a higher rate of monoisocenters. We looked for differences between this population of arteriovenous malformations and the rest of the series for patients, treatments prior radiosurgery, cerebral arteriovenous malformations's characteristics, dosimetric parameters and complications. Statistical analysis was done with a Pearson chi2 test and Spearman non parametric correlation test. RESULTS: Obiteration rate was 47.6% with a mean delay of 26 months. Differential characteristics of choroidal or cisternal arteriovenous malformations were: younger age of revelation, higher frequency of hemorrhage, of intra or paranidal aneurysms, of deep unique drainage, a higher Spetzler grade and a smaller rate of complete recovering. Mortality and clinical morbidity due to radiosurgery were 0%. Actuarial rate of hemorrhage after radiosurgery was 4,34% per year and per patient or per hemorrhage. This rate was higher than in the global series. Parenchymal changes seen on MRI were less frequent (26,6%) and less serious (no grade 4 radionecrosis-like parenchymal changes). CONCLUSION: Choroidal or cisternal arteriovenous malformations seem to respond less to radiosurgery than others. One potential explanation is the higher frequency of multiafferences of these arteriovenous malformations with anastomoses of anterior and posterior choroidal arteries. However, radiosurgery still stay a treatment of choice for these arteriovenous malformations with little adaptations of the irradiation strategy.",2001 May,2001,Neuro-Chirurgie,47,2-3 Pt 2,283-90,fre,False,75782,Evaluation Study;Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology;Cerebral Ventricles/blood supply/surgery;Child;Choroid Plexus/*blood supply/surgery;Cisterna Magna/*blood supply/surgery;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/epidemiology/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Paris/epidemiology;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome,

The patients were all male, from 8 to 51 years old (mean = 24), all presenting with intracerebral haemorrhage. The lesion was located in the deep sylvian fissure in one patient, the fronto-parieto-occipital area in one and the trigone in two. Stereotactic computed tomography and magnetic resource imaging of 1-mm slices were taken. The extent of AVM and the draining vein, predetermined with the MKM workstation, could be superimposed on the microscopic view, resulting in minimum scalp incision and craniotomy, as well as allowing for a stereotactic approach to deep-seated lesions. Superimposition of the contour of the lesion was also useful for resecting the lesion, although intraoperative diagnosis of the total resection required intraoperative digital subtraction angiography.

31320549,MR characteristics of unruptured intracranial arteriovenous malformations associated with seizure as initial clinical presentation.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are at increased risk of seizures. OBJECTIVE: To identify MRI characteristics of unruptured intracranial AVMs associated with seizures at presentation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was completed of patients diagnosed with unruptured intracranial AVMs on MRI between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2016. Two blinded reviewers assessed demographics, lesion locality, and imaging and architectural characteristics of AVMs and surrounding parenchyma, including, but not limited to, AVM location, venous drainage pattern, venous varix, thrombosed venous varix, long draining vein, AVM-related gliosis, peri-AVM edema, and peri-AVM T2* signal. Findings were statistically analyzed for correlation with seizure using Student's t-test for continuous variables and Χ(2) test for categorical variables. RESULTS: Of 165 included patients, 57/165 (34.5%) patients were imaged as part of an investigation for seizures. Patients with seizures more commonly had peri-AVM edema (36.8%, compared with 11.1% of non-seizure patients, p<0.0001), peri-AVM T2* blooming (28.1% vs 7.4%; p=0.029), a venous pouch/varix (61.4% vs 31.5%, p=0.0003), long draining vein (91.2% vs 55.6%, p<0.0001), and larger size based on Spetzler-Martin grade categorization (p=0.006). By location, AVMs located in the frontal lobe, primary motor cortex, and primary sensory cortex were associated with seizures (p=0.004, p=0.001, and p=0.006, respectively); temporal lobe location was not associated with seizures (p=0.459).

11404695,[Toward an anatomoclinical classification for arteriovenous malformations?].,"This brief study tends to point out that each clinical symptom (hemorrhage, seizures or epilepsy, headaches and progressive neurological deficits) related to cerebral arteriovenous malformations cerebral arteriovenous malformations can be correlated with the anatomy and the angioarchitecture of the cerebral arteriovenous malformations. The most dramatic data were the bipolar-like correlations between hemorrhage and seizures: each parameter correlated positively with hemorrhage was correlated negatively with seizures and vice versa. These data seem to show that cerebral arteriovenous malformations causing seizures have a low risk of hemorrhage, and cerebral arteriovenous malformations with a high hemorrhage risk have a low risk of seizures (excepting with an hematoma).

15326243,Seizure outcomes after stereotactic radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of stereotactic radiosurgery on seizure outcomes for patients with intracerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM). METHODS: Between May 1990 and December 1998, 65 patients with a history of single or recurrent seizures underwent AVM radiosurgery, had more than 1 year of follow-up, and sufficient data to record an Engel seizure frequency score. The authors reviewed their records and updated clinical information when necessary with direct patient contact. Follow-up ranged from 12 to 144 months (median, 48 months). Seizure frequency was compared before and after radiosurgery with the Engel Seizure Frequency Scoring System. RESULTS: Overall, 26 patients (51%) were seizure-free (aura-free) after radiosurgery at 3-year follow-up; 40 patients (78%) had an excellent outcome (non-disabling simple partial seizures only) at 3-year follow-up. Factors associated with seizure-free or excellent outcomes include a low seizure frequency score (<4) before radiosurgery and smaller size and diameter AVM. Twenty-three patients had intractable partial epilepsy prior to treatment. Twelve (52%) of 23 and 11 of 18 (61%) patients with medically intractable partial epilepsy had excellent outcomes at years 1 and 3. CONCLUSION: Overall, stereotactic radiosurgery improves seizure outcomes in the majority of patients and more than half of the patients with medically intractable partial epilepsy had an excellent seizure outcome after radiosurgery.",2004 Aug 24,2004,Neurology,63,4,683-7,eng,False,63/4/683;10.1212/01.wnl.0000134659.95217.6e,Evaluation Study;Journal Article;Review,Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use;Brain Edema/etiology/mortality;Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology/mortality;Epilepsy/drug therapy/etiology;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Postoperative Period;*Radiosurgery;Recurrence;Seizures/drug therapy/*etiology;Treatment Outcome,
35074077,Cavernous malformations.,"Cavernous malformations are relatively common intracerebral malformations of which we only became properly aware after the introduction of MRI. They may be sporadic or familial. Familial CMs may be multiple and new lesions appear over time requiring intermittent MR control. Many sporadic CMs have no symptoms. The commonest location is in the supratentorial cerebral parenchyma presenting with epilepsy. The best treatment is microsurgery. A small proportion are in the brainstem and may rebleed and even be lethal. Treatment includes microsurgery and radiosurgery.

23369157,Individual beam sharpening improves composite dose fall-off near a target for non-isocentric cyberknife radiosurgery.,"Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) refers to a high dose of radiation delivered to a focal region of interest while maximizing the steep dose gradient to minimize dose to the surrounding normal tissues. Multiple factors can influence the dose fall-off, and the relative importance of such factors have not yet been characterized for non-isocentric Cyberknife SRS. Our aim was to investigate whether the composite dose fall-off near a target may be enhanced via sharpening the lateral beam profile (or penumbra) of each individual beam. Cyberknife beam profiles were fitted and parameterized to obtain a characteristic penumbra function for each collimator size. Simulated beam profiles with progressively sharper penumbras were then generated, and used to perform simulated treatment planning on seven pediatric intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) cases. Penumbra size was found to significantly influence the peripheral dose fall-off. Peripheral dose volumes were reduced by 5 to 10% with reductions in penumbra size ranging from 40 to 80%. Dose conformality and homogeneity were not significantly changed with decreasing penumbra size. Therefore, individual beam sharpening provides a straightforward way of improving the composite dose fall-off for non-isocentric Cyberknife SRS.",2013 Aug,2013,Technology in cancer research & treatment,12,4,341-8,eng,False,10.7785/tcrt.2012.500322;10.7785/tcrt.2012.500322,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Humans;Neoplasms/pathology/*surgery;Radiosurgery/*methods;Radiotherapy Dosage;Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted/*methods",
11404717,[Parenchymal changes after radiosurgery of cerebral arteriovenous malformations. Clinical and MRI data].,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Purposes of this study are to describe different parenchymal changes seen after radiosurgery of cerebral arteriovenous malformations and the clinical symptoms which can be associated, and risk factors correlated with them. PATIENTS: and method. From the whole population of 705 patients with a cerebral arteriovenous malformations treated by radiosurgery between 1984 and 1998, clinical from 615 patients and post radiosurgery MRI data from 367 patients were reviewed. Neurological deficit occurred in 5.37% of cases and was still persistant in 1.46% of cases. Delay of occurrence of deficits ranged from 6 to 83 months (mean: 27 months, median: 15 months). Parenchymal changes seen in MRI were classified in 4 grades: 1 without parenchymal changes, 2 hypersignal in sp T2, 3=2 with homogenous enhancement with gadolinium, 4 with hyposignal in spT1 and annular irregular enhancement. Several parameters (size, volume, angioarchitecture of the cerebral arteriovenous malformation, dosimetric parameters) were studied and correlations were searched by uni and multivariate analysis with occurrence and delay of occurrence of deficits or parenchymal changes. RESULTS: In multivariate analysis, only size was significantly correlated with occurrence of parenchymal changes (p=0.0016); only size of the malformation was significantly correlated with delay of occurrence of parenchymal changes (p=0.0082); only grade 4 was correlated with occurrence of neurological deficit (p<0.00001). However, when only ""a priori"" parameters (known before radiosurgery) are introducted in logistic model, size taille (p=0.02) and hypoplasy of a sinus (p=0.0049) are significantly correlated with occurrence of neurological deficit. Only parenchymal changes grade 4 was significantly correlated with delay of occurrence of a neurological deficit (p<0.00001). However, when only a priori parameters (known before radiosurgery) are introducted in logistic model, only arterial steal (p=0.054) was significantly correlated with delay of occurrence of a neurological deficit. CONCLUSION: Parenchymal changes are various in expression, signification and clinical symptoms associated with them.

24199192,Endothelial gene expression and molecular changes in response to radiosurgery in in vitro and in vivo models of cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"Radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is limited to 2-year latency. There is no early marker to monitor whether the lesion is responsive to radiosurgery. In this study, we examined endothelial gene expression and molecular changes in response to radiosurgery. Gene expression of E- and P-selectin, ICAM-1, PECAM-1, VCAM-1, tissue factor, and vWF in human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells was quantified by RT-qPCR at different radiation doses and time points. Soluble E- and P-selectin, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and tissue factor in an animal model of AVMs were quantified by ELISA at different time after radiosurgery. We found that gene expression of E- and P-selectin, ICAM-1, PECAM-1, and VCAM-1 was upregulated by radiation in a dose-dependent manner (P < .05). Gene expression of E- and P-selectin and ICAM-1 was more sensitive to irradiation than that of PECAM-1 and VCAM-1. Radiosurgery induced gene expression of P-selectin, ICAM-1, PECAM-1, and VCAM-1 was linearly correlated with time (P < .05). Radiosurgery induced elevation of soluble E- and P-selectin, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and tissue factor in a rat model of AVMs (P < .05). Thus, a combination of these molecules measured at different time points may serve as an early predictor of responsiveness of AVMs to radiosurgery.",2013,2013,BioMed research international,2013,,408253,eng,False,10.1155/2013/408253;408253;10.1155/2013/408253,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Animals;Cells, Cultured;Endothelium/cytology/*metabolism/radiation effects;Gene Expression Regulation/radiation effects;Humans;Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/biosynthesis;Intracranial Arteriovenous;P-Selectin/biosynthesis;*Radiosurgery;Rats;Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/biosynthesis",
22546028,Corticospinal tract mapping in children with ruptured arteriovenous malformations using functionally guided diffusion-tensor imaging.,"Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) can lead to distortion or reorganization of functional brain anatomy, making localization of eloquent white matter tracts challenging. To improve the accuracy of corticospinal tract (CST) mapping, recent studies have examined the use of functional imaging techniques to help localize cortical motor activations and use these as seed points to reconstruct CSTs using diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI). The authors examined the role of pretreatment functionally guided DTI CST mapping in 3 children with ruptured AVMs. In 2 patients, magnetoencephalography motor activations were adjacent to the nidus and/or hemorrhagic cavity. However, in 1 child, functional MRI motor activations were detected in both hemispheres, suggestive of partial transfer of cortical motor function. In all children, quantitative analysis showed that fractional anisotropy values and fiber density indices were reduced in the CSTs of the hemisphere harboring the AVM compared with the unaffected side. In 2 children, CST caliber was slightly diminished, corresponding to no motor deficit in 1 patient and a temporary motor deficit in the other. In contrast, 1 child demonstrated marked reduction and displacement of the CSTs, correlating with severe motor deficit. Preoperative motor tractography data were loaded onto the intraoperative neuronavigation platform to guide complete resection of the AVM in 2 cases without permanent neurological deficits. These preliminary results confirm the feasibility of CST mapping in children with ruptured AVMs using functionally guided DTI tractography. Prospective studies are needed to assess the full value of this technique in the risk stratification, prognosis, and multimodality management of pediatric AVMs.",2012 May,2012,Journal of neurosurgery.

16922068,Surgical management of arteriovenous malformations in children.,"OBJECT: Children compose 3 to 20% of the patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs); however, AVMs are responsible for 30 to 50% of intracranial hemorrhages in children. METHODS: The medical records of 82 children with 84 AVMs treated surgically between 1983 and 2005 were reviewed. Fifty-two patients (63%) presented with hemorrhage, 13.4% presented with seizures, and AVMs in 12% were found incidentally. Patients with brainstem lesions presented at a significantly younger age (p = 0.002) than those harboring lesions in other locations. Frontal lobe lesions were significantly smaller than those in other locations, and thalamic lesions were significantly larger (p = 0.012 and 0.005, respectively). Most patients with Spetzler-Martin Grades I to III lesions underwent craniotomy only. Half of the patients with Grade IV and V lesions underwent embolization, craniotomy, and radiosurgery. The mean follow-up period was 43 months. Postoperatively, the initial obliteration rate was 65%, with a long-term obliteration rate of 90%. The perioperative mortality rate was 3.7%. Altogether, 81% of patients had excellent outcomes, and patients with Grade I lesions had the best outcomes. Of the 52 patients who presented with hemorrhage, 17% had fair or poor outcomes. The recurrence rate was 5.6%. CONCLUSIONS: Children with AVMs may be more prone than adults to present with a hemorrhage and to experience recurrence of the lesion after treatment. The authors favor resection for most AVMs in children and use embolization as a preoperative strategy for Grades II to V lesions treated surgically. Prehemorrhagic Grade IV and V lesions may best be treated conservatively and observed carefully for the development of symptoms.

27231973,Reappearance of arteriovenous malformations after complete resection of ruptured arteriovenous malformations: true recurrence or false-negative early postoperative imaging result?,"OBJECTIVE Ruptured arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are often obliterated after emergency microsurgical treatment. However, some studies have reported AVM recurrence after the obliteration of ruptured AVMs. The authors report their experience with AVM recurrence after successful microsurgical treatment of ruptured AVMs. METHODS The authors reviewed the medical data of 139 consecutive patients who underwent microsurgery at the authors' institution for ruptured AVM between 2002 and 2012. Each patient underwent a conventional cerebral angiography examination immediately after the surgery. Subsequent follow-ups were performed with MR angiography after 6 months, and, if there was no indication of AVM recurrence, patients were followed up with conventional cerebral angiography between 1 and 2 years after the treatment; pediatric patients were followed up until age 18 years. Recurrence was defined as new radiological evidence of an AVM at the site of a ruptured AVM or a new hemorrhage in patients with angiographically documented AVM obliteration on postoperative angiograms. RESULTS The mean age of the patients at the time of ruptured AVM diagnosis was 30.8 years (SD ± 5, range 4-69 years), and 44 of the patients were younger than 18 years (the mean age at diagnosis in this pediatric subgroup was 11.4 years [range 4-17.9 years]). Complete AVM obliteration after the initial microsurgery was observed in 123 patients (89.5%). Reappearance of an AVM was noted in 7 patients between 12 and 42 months after the treatment, and all of these patients were younger than 18 years. The recurrent AVM was located in an eloquent zone in 4 patients, and deep venous drainage was noted in 3 patients. Radiosurgery was performed in 6 of these patients, and 1 patient underwent another microsurgical procedure. The authors noted only one rebleeding due to an AVM recurrence during the latency period after radiosurgery. CONCLUSIONS The recurrence of an AVM is fairly rare and affects mostly pediatric patients. Therefore, especially in children, long-term angiographic follow-up is required to detect AVM recurrence or an AVM remnant.

15271235,Bleeding after radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVE: Obliteration is progressive after radiosurgery (RS) for cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM), and until it is complete, there is still a risk of hemorrhage. The aim of our study was to evaluate the severity of hemorrhage after RS, the actuarial risk of hemorrhage, and the parameters associated with hemorrhage. METHODS: Of 756 patients treated by linear accelerator RS for AVM, 51 (6.5%) had one or more hemorrhages after the RS. We studied the clinical, anatomic, and dosimetric parameters and obliteration rate before hemorrhage and then calculated the actuarial risk per patient and per hemorrhage before and after RS. Correlations between parameters and risk were studied by univariate and multivariate analysis using Kaplan-Meier hemorrhage-free survival curves and the Cox model. RESULTS: Apart from one exclusively ventricular hemorrhage, which caused the death of the patient, only parenchymal hemorrhages were associated with morbidity and neurological deficits (64.5% of all cases of hemorrhage had neurological deficits, 45% had a permanent deficit). The overall mortality rate per hemorrhage was 7.14%. The overall morbidity rate was 47.6%, 26.2% with a permanent deficit. In all but one patient, the AVM was not cured before hemorrhage; thus, the mean obliteration rate before hemorrhage was 24%. The actuarial hemorrhage rates were 3.08% per year per patient and 3.31% per year per hemorrhage. The actuarial rate per patient increased from 1.66% the 1st year to 3.87% in the 5th year after RS but was not statistically different from the rate before radiosurgery. The parameters found to be correlated with hemorrhage risk after RS using multivariate analysis were intranidal or paranidal aneurysms, complete coverage, and minimum dose. CONCLUSION: The risk of hemorrhage after RS would seem to be the sum of hemorrhage risk factors of the AVM and factors predicting a poor level of obliteration. These factors can be predicted in some cases but rarely avoided.",2004 Aug,2004,Neurosurgery,55,2,298-305; discussion 305-6,eng,False,10.1227/01.neu.0000129473.52172.b5,Journal Article,"Actuarial Analysis;Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Analysis of Variance;Brain Damage, Chronic/mortality;Cause of Death;Cerebral Hemorrhage/*etiology/mortality;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;France;Humans;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/mortality/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Neurologic Examination/statistics & numerical data;Postoperative Hemorrhage/*etiology/mortality;*Radiosurgery/mortality;Retrospective Studies;Risk Factors;Survival Analysis",

Interventional neuroradiology is dedicated to the treatment of patients who present with pathologies of the brain, the face, and the spinal cord that are treatable by direct percutaneous or endovascular approaches. Indications of INR have dramatically increased over the last 20 years thanks to innovations in radiological equipments (angio suite, 3D images, etc.) and embolic materials. The endovascular treatment alone is generally curative but sometimes it will be performed before surgery to decrease its risks. Interventional neuroradiology is thus part of several multidisciplinary teams including departments of neurosurgery, neurology, intensive care, anesthesiology, vascular surgery, ENT, etc. We will present the main indication of INR that is the treatment of patients with aneurysms and other intracranial vascular malformations.

11409517,Radiation necrosis following gamma knife surgery: a case-controlled comparison of treatment parameters and long-term clinical follow up.,"OBJECT: Radiation necrosis is the only significant complication of gamma knife surgery (GKS). The authors studied treatment plan parameters in patients who had radiation necrosis to determine if risk factors for necrosis could be identified. METHODS: Between September 1994 and December 1998, 286 patients were treated with GKS by the senior author. Of the 243 patients who were suitable for analysis, 17 developed radiation necrosis and were prospectively followed. Concurrently, 17 patients without necrosis were randomly selected as case controls on the basis of histological findings in their lesions. Integral dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were calculated and dose-volume treatment parameters were determined. A comparison was made with both the established Kjellberg and Flickinger isonecrosis risk lines. Clinical outcome was assessed according to time to resolution of symptoms and return to normal radiographic appearance. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment plan variables associated with the risk of necrosis were increased tumor volume (TV) integral dose, increased TV, and increased 10-Gy volume. Other risk factors included repeated radiosurgery to the same lesion and glioma histological findings. The Kjellberg 1% risk line predicted a 5% risk of radiation necrosis and the Flickinger 3% risk line predicted a 3% risk. The median time to development of necrosis was 4 months, and symptomatic and radiographic recovery times were 7.5 and 10.5 months, respectively. The median survival time in patients with necrosis was 30 months.

METHODS: To measure serum biomarkers, peripheral venous blood was collected before SRS and 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after SRS. To evaluate RICs, clinical and neuroimaging follow-up were performed concurrently every 6 months after SRS. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients were enrolled (11 in the group with RIC, 16 in the group without RIC). Serum VEGF and endostatin levels were positively correlated (P = 0.036, r = 0.405). In the group with RIC, the median serum VEGF 6 months after SRS (58.98 pg/mL) was significantly higher than that of the group without RIC (15.17 pg/mL) (P = 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that higher VEGF 6 months after SRS (P = 0.001, hazard ratio, 1.032; 95% confidence interval, 1.012-1.052) and lower endostatin 1 month after SRS (P = 0.007, hazard ratio, 0.964; 95% confidence interval, 0.935-0.993) were significantly associated with RICs. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that serum levels of VEGF 6 months after SRS were higher in the group with RIC. Serum levels of VEGF 6 months and endostatin 1 month after SRS were associated with the radiological RICs.

DISCUSSION: We report a case of a 27-month-old girl who presented with an initial dural arteriovenous fistula (AVF) located at anterior base of the left middle cranial fossa. She subsequently developed another dural AVF over the left transverse-sigmoid sinus region 2 years later. CONCLUSION: Both fistulae were successfully obliterated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery.",2007 Oct,2007,Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for,23,10,1185-90,eng,False,10.1007/s00381-007-0363-0,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Arteriovenous Fistula/*pathology/*surgery;Cranial Fossa, Middle/*abnormalities/surgery;Dura Mater/*pathology/*surgery;Female;Humans;Infant;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*pathology/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Angiography;*Radiosurgery;Recurrence;Transverse Sinuses/*abnormalities/surgery",
15730573,Effect of presenting hemorrhage on outcome after microsurgical resection of brain arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that patients with unruptured arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) at presentation have an increased risk of deterioration compared with patients with ruptured AVMs. METHODS: A consecutive series of 224 patients treated microsurgically by a single neurosurgeon during a period of 6.4 years was analyzed. Initial hemorrhagic presentation was the primary predictor variable. Neurological outcomes were assessed by use of the Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), and logistic regression identified predictors of deterioration at follow-up (mean duration, 1.3 yr) relative to baseline before any intervention. RESULTS: Overall, 120 patients (54%) presented with hemorrhage, and all 224 patients underwent microsurgical resection. Complete resection was achieved in 220 patients (98%). According to GOS score, 13 patients (5.8%) deteriorated; according to MRS score, 45 patients (20.1%) deteriorated. Fifteen patients (6.7%) died. Hemorrhagic presentation was associated with improved outcomes, with a mean change in MRS score of +0.89 in patients with ruptured AVMs and -0.38 in patients with unruptured AVMs (P < 0.001). The final mean MRS scores in patients with unruptured AVMs were better than those in patients with ruptured AVMs (1.44 versus 1.90; P = 0.048). Presentation with an unruptured AVM was a predictor of worsening MRS score (odds ratio, 2.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-4.3; P = 0.006) but not of worsening GOS score. CONCLUSION: Presentation with AVM hemorrhage is an underappreciated predictor of outcome after therapy that includes microsurgical resection. Patients with ruptured AVMs tended to have deficits at presentation and generally improved after surgery, whereas patients with unruptured AVMs tended to have normal or nearly normal neurological function at presentation and were susceptible to worsening, albeit slight, as measured by MRS scores. Sensitive outcome measures such as MRS detect subtle symptoms and impairments missed by coarser measures such as GOS. Patients should be counseled that the risks associated with elective resection of unruptured AVMs may be higher than recognized previously. Hemorrhagic brain injury and its secondary effects may mask this surgical morbidity.",2005 Mar,2005,Neurosurgery,56,3,485-93; discussion 485-93,eng,False,10.1227/01.neu.0000153924.67360.ea,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Brain Damage, Chronic/*epidemiology/etiology/prevention & control;Brain Edema/etiology;*Case Management;Cerebral Hemorrhage/*etiology;Child;Combined Modality Therapy;Elective Surgical Procedures;Embolization, Therapeutic;Female;Glasgow Outcome Scale;Humans;Hydrocephalus/etiology;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/*surgery/therapy;Intracranial Hypertension/etiology;Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy;Male;Microsurgery;Middle Aged;Postoperative Complications/*epidemiology/etiology/prevention & control;Radiosurgery;Risk;Rupture, Spontaneous;Severity of Illness Index;Treatment Outcome",
11404716,[Course of headaches associated with cAVMs after radiosurgery].,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the response of headaches associated with cerebral arteriovenous malformations following radiosurgery and determine the factors that are associated with a positive outcome. From our series of 700 patients whose cAVM was treated by radiosurgery, this study includes 109 patients (48 males, 61 females) with a mean age of 32 when radiosurgery was performed. Headaches resolved in 37 patients (53.7%), decreased in 14 patients (20.3%), persisted in 16 patients (23.2%), and even increased in frequency in 2 (2.9%). Headaches disappeared 2 years following radiosurgery in the majority of patients (31 out of 37: 83.3%). The disappearance rate of headaches was better when it was the only sign of the malformation (64%) or preceded an epileptic seizure (60%) with respect to the case when it preceded cerebral hemorrhage (34.8%). Headaches having the best response were those with 1 to 2 episodes per month (64.9%) and whose episode duration was less than 3 hours (67.6%). Unilateral headaches accounted for 86.5% of resolved headaches whereas bilateral headaches were only 8.1% and even less were the diffuse ones (5.4%). The best evolution was obtained for those associated with a parietal location of the cerebral arteriovenous malformation, followed by rolandic (respectively 55.5% and 50%). Occipital malformation was associated with headache disappearance in 38.1% and temporal with 34.3%, whereas frontal location was associated with headache disappearance in only 25% of the cases. Headache disappearance was often correlated with cerebral arteriovenous malformation outcome after radiosurgery (64.9% of disappearance in case of complete obliteration). However, in 24.8%, headaches disappeared prior to the malformation obliteration and were associated with a decrease of the flow, of the nidus volume or with the nidus disappearance with the persistence of a precocious venous drainage. Headaches disappeared in spite of the malformation persistence in 5.4% of the cases. We found de novo headaches in one patient one year following RS. Another patient presented an episode of headache 12 hours following RS. The course of headaches associated with cerebral arteriovenous malformations after radiosurgery is positive in the majority of cases and correlated to the malformation outcome. This correlation suggests a link between cerebral arteriovenous malformations and headaches and the equal benefit of radiosurgery on both of them.",2001 May,2001,Neuro-Chirurgie,47,2-3 Pt 2,350-4,fre,False,75762,English Abstract;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Age of Onset;Aged;Brain Damage, Chronic/epidemiology/etiology;Child;Child, Preschool;Epilepsy/epidemiology/etiology;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Headache/epidemiology/*etiology;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/epidemiology/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Paris/epidemiology;Postoperative Complications/epidemiology/*etiology;Prognosis;*Radiosurgery;Remission, Spontaneous;Retrospective Studies;Risk Factors;Sex Factors;Treatment Outcome",
11117872,Stereotactic radiosurgery for cavernous malformations.,"OBJECT: The use of stereotactic radiosurgery to treat cerebral cavernous malformations (CMs) is controversial. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of CM radiosurgery, the authors reviewed the experience at the Mayo Clinic during the past 10 years. METHODS: Seventeen patients underwent radiosurgery for high-surgical-risk CMs in the following sites: thalamus/basal ganglia (four patients), brainstem (12 patients), and corpus callosum (one patient). All patients had experienced at least two documented hemorrhages before undergoing radiosurgery. Stereotactic magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was used for target localization in all cases. The median margin radiation dose was 18 Gy and the median maximum dose was 32 Gy. The median length of follow-up review following radiosurgery was 51 months. The annual hemorrhage rate during the 51 months preceding radiosurgery was 40.1%, compared with 8.8% in the first 2 years following radiosurgery and 2.9% thereafter. In 10 patients (59%) new neurological deficits developed that were associated with regions of increased signal on long-repetition time MR imaging performed a median of 8 months (range 5-16 months) after radiosurgery. Three patients recovered, giving the group a permanent radiation-related morbidity rate of 41%. Compared with 31 patients harboring arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of sizes and in locations similar to those of the aforementioned CMs, who underwent radiosurgery during the same time period, the patients with CMs were more likely to experience radiation-related complications (any complication, 59% compared with 10%; p < 0.001; permanent complication, 41% compared with 10%; p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: It is impossible to conclude that radiosurgery protects patients with CMs against future hemorrhage risk based on the available data, although it appears that some reduction in the bleeding rate occurs after a latency interval of several years. The risk of radiation-related complications after radiosurgery to treat CMs is greater than that found after radiosurgery in AVMs, even when adjusting for lesion size and location and for radiation dose.",2000 Dec,2000,Journal of neurosurgery,93,6,987-91,eng,False,10.3171/jns.2000.93.6.0987,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Brain Neoplasms/diagnosis/*surgery;Cerebral Hemorrhage/diagnosis/surgery;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Hemangioma, Cavernous/diagnosis/*surgery;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Postoperative Complications/diagnosis/etiology;*Radiosurgery;Treatment Outcome",

23258504,A brief history of arteriovenous malformation radiosurgery.,"Stereotactic radiosurgery was first described by Leksell in Stockholm, Sweden in 1951. In 1967, Leksell introduced the 'Gamma Knife' for clinical use in carefully selected patients. A major role for radiosurgery further emerged in 1972 after its application for brain arteriovenous malformations. Radiosurgery was initially used for high risk or deep seated AVMs that were unsuitable for resection or embolization. Several additional pioneers contributed towards its continued development. Stereotactic radiosurgery is now considered as an important option for patients with brain vascular malformations, including AVMs, cavernous malformations, and dural AV fistulas.",2013,2013,Progress in neurological surgery,27,,1-4,eng,False,10.1159/000341608;000341608;10.1159/000341608,Historical Article;Journal Article,"Arteriovenous Malformations/*history/surgery;History, 20th Century;History, 21st Century;Humans;Radiosurgery/*history",
11404692,[Characteristics of epileptic seizures associated with cerebral arteriovenous malformations].,"PURPOSES: The purpose of this study is to analyze the characteristics of epileptic seizures associated with cerebral arteriovenous malformations treated by radiosurgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seven hundred and two patients are studied (406 men, 296 women) with a mean age of 33 when radiosurgery was performed. 210 patients had epileptic seizures; those seizures either uniquely revealed the arteriovenous malformation or were associated with other clinical signs. Seizures occurring after an hemorrhage were excluded from the study. We studied the age category upon seizures occurrence, the malformation localization, type of seizure (partial, generalized, or partial secondary generalized), the history related to the epileptic seizures, the clinical topographical correlation, the number of seizures, their duration prior to the radiosurgery, antiepileptic treatment provided, electroence-phalographic characteristics, angiographic characteristics, prior endovascular or surgical treatment, and factors associated with severe seizure. RESULTS: Epileptic seizures revealed the arteriovenous malformations in 30% of the cases; they predominated between 10 and 40 years (80.5%) with a peak between 20 and 30 years. The malformation localization most frequently associated with seizures were temporal and rolandic for partial seizures, whereas frontal or sylvian localization were predominantly associated with generalized seizures. The type of seizure was, in all cases, related to the malformation localization because of the initial signs seizure. 47.6% of the patients showed a limited number of seizures (between 2 and 20), 27.6% showed only a single seizure, and 24.7% suffered from severe epilepsy. Generalized seizures are unique in the majority of cases (61.8%) whereas partial seizures were severe in 47.6% of the cases. The majority of patients are under a single-drug therapy (79%). The EEG patterns showed a small increase of slow and sharp localized waves in patients presenting seizures compared with the global population (27% and 15% respectively). Severe seizures predominated between 10 and 19 years of age; seizures were exclusively partial in 59.6% of the cases and secondary generalized in 40.4%, their frequencies were between 1 to 4 per month in the majority of cases (59.1%), the delay was often more than 10 years (57.7%), status epilepticus was rare (5.8%), temporal and rolandic localization were predominant, social and professional insertion of the patient was preserved in 87.5% of the cases, and seizures did not provoke any death. The angiographic characteristics associated with seizures were: superficial localization, volume, superficial venous drainage, recruitment and venous divergence.

14618410,Effects of ionizing radiation on brain tissue surrounding arteriovenous malformations: an experimental study in a rat caroticojugular fistula model.,"Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) may change the cerebral hemodynamics. The purpose of this study was to detect the effects of ionizing radiation (IR) on tissues surrounding AVM in a rat caroticojugular fistula model. Forty rats were divided into four groups. Eight weeks after caroticojugular fistulas and chronic hypoperfusion were created in groups 1 and 2, IR was administered to groups 1 and 3. Group 4 was the control. Brain tissue samples were taken 72 h after irradiation. Comet assay to detect DNA strand breaks (DSB), terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay for apoptosis, and free radical measurement were performed. Although the difference between fistula plus irradiation (group 1) and fistula (group 2) was statistically insignificant in terms of DSB and free radical measurement, apoptotic cell count was significantly higher in group 1. Nonetheless, apoptotic cell count corresponded well with both free radicals and DSB in the irradiated group (group 3). Ionizing radiation resulted in significant apoptosis in both groups with or without fistulas. Chronic hypoperfusion might not prevent cerebral damage after IR. Optimal care should be taken with brain tissue around AVM during radiotherapy, regardless of presence or absence of the ""steal"" phenomenon.",2004 Apr,2004,Neurosurgical review,27,2,121-7,eng,False,10.1007/s10143-003-0316-3,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Animals;Apoptosis/*radiation effects;*Arteriovenous Shunt, Surgical;Carotid Artery, Internal/surgery;Cell Count;Comet Assay;DNA Damage/*radiation effects;Disease Models, Animal;Free Radicals/metabolism/*radiation effects;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery;Jugular Veins/surgery;Male;Parietal Lobe/metabolism/*radiation effects;Radiation, Ionizing;Radiosurgery;Rats;Rats, Wistar",

CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a 30-year-old woman with a ruptured right parietal CCM treated with SRS 13 years ago. The post-SRS imaging follow-up revealed CCM rehemorrhage and cyst formation. Surgical resection was performed, and a subsequent pathological examination revealed that the CCM still had some incomplete occluded vessels and a large number of newly formed capillaries, and hemorrhagic band and hemosiderin were seen around the nodule. CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent hemorrhage after SRS for CCM could be related to incomplete occluded vessels and newly formed capillaries. Repeated hemorrhage from CCM newly formed capillaries into the small cavity increased the osmotic pressure, resulting in fluid entering the cavity and cyst enlargement.",2020 Nov,2020,World neurosurgery,143,,392-397,eng,False,S1878-8750(20)31553-9;10.1016/j.wneu.2020.07.042;S1878-8750(20)31553-9;10.1016/j.wneu.2020.07.042,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Adult;Blood Vessels/pathology;Central Nervous System Cysts/surgery;Cysts/pathology/surgery;Female;Hemangioma, Cavernous, Central Nervous System/*pathology/*surgery;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*pathology/*surgery;Intracranial Hemorrhages/surgery;Neurosurgical Procedures;*Radiosurgery;Recurrence;Rupture;Treatment Outcome",Cerebral cavernous malformation;Cyst;Pathological changes;Stereotactic radiosurgery

Head computed tomography showed a left frontal-parietal blood clot. An intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography demonstrated a left subcortical postcentral, Spetzler-Martin Grade 3 arteriovenous malformation (AVM) with a diffuse nidus, measuring 2.1 × 1.5 cm, supplied by branches of the left MCA, and draining into a cortical vein and a deep vein, which was going toward the ventricle. Preoperative embolization was not possible. The patient underwent left frontal-parietal craniotomy with intraoperative motor and sensory mapping. No arterialized veins were visible on the cortical surface. Neuronavigation localized the AVM in the subcortical postcentral gyrus. Through an incision in the postcentral sulcus, microdissection led to a yellowish gliotic plane. The large cortical vein was in the gliotic area and traced to the AVM. Circumferential microdissection was performed around the AVM. It had a very diffuse nidus; the arterial feeders were cauterized and divided, and the superior superficial and inferior deep draining veins were finally occluded, and AVM was removed. Postoperative angiogram showed total removal of the AVM. At discharge, his right arm weakness had improved (power 5/5), and facial weakness and dysarthria were improving (modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 2). At 1-yr follow-up, facial weakness and dysarthria had improved considerably, and patient returned to work (mRS 1). This video shows microsurgical resection of an AVM by neuronavigation and tracing of the subcortical draining vein. The technique of cauterizing the perforating arteries after temporary clipping with flow arrest is shown in the video.

17415173,Neuronavigation for arteriovenous malformation surgery by intraoperative three-dimensional ultrasound angiography.,"OBJECTIVE: Neuronavigational devices have traditionally used preoperative imaging with limited possibilities for adjustment to brain shift and intraoperative manipulation of the surgical lesions. We have used an intraoperative imaging and navigation system that uses navigation on intraoperatively acquired three-dimensional ultrasound data, as well as preoperatively acquired magnetic resonance imaging scans and magnetic resonance angiograms. The usefulness of this system for arteriovenous malformation (AVM) surgery was evaluated prospectively. METHODS: Nine consecutive patients with Spetzler Grade 1 (n = 3), 2 (n = 3), 3(n = 2) or 4 (n = 1) AVMs underwent operation using this intraoperative imaging and navigation system. The system provides real-time rendering of three-dimensional angiographic data and can visualize such projections in a stereoscopic (virtual reality) manner using special glasses. The experiences with this technology were analyzed and the outcomes assessed. Angiographic reconstructions of three-dimensional images were obtained before and after resection. RESULTS: Conventional navigation on the basis of preoperative magnetic resonance angiography was helpful to secure positioning of the bone flap; stereoscopic visualization of the same data represented a powerful means to construct a mental three-dimensional picture of the extent of the AVM and the feeder anatomy even before skin incision. Intraoperative ultrasound corresponded well to the intraoperative findings and allowed confirmation of feeding vessels in surrounding gyri and rapid identification of the perinidal dissection planes, regardless of brain shift. The latter feature was particularly helpful because the intraoperative navigational identification of surgical planes leads to minimal exploration into the nidus or dissection at a greater distance from the malformation. Application of the system was thought to increase surgical confidence. In two patients, postresection ultrasound prompted additional nidus removal. Ultrasound angiography seemed to allow some degree of resection control, although its sensitivity was not thought to be sufficient. All AVMs were radically removed without new permanent morbidity. CONCLUSION: The complexities of handling the pathological vessels of AVMs were ameliorated by intraoperative three-dimensional ultrasound and navigation because the three-dimensional outline of the vasculature (feeders, nidus, and draining veins) provided a means to adapt resection strategies, define dissection planes, and interpret intraoperative findings. It is difficult to provide a scientifically valid definition of ""added value."" However, in our experience, the added confidence and the improved mental image of the lesion that resulted from this technology improved the quality and flow of surgery.",2007 Apr,2007,Neurosurgery,60,4 Suppl 2,345-50; discussion 350-1,eng,False,00006123-200704001-00020;10.1227/01.NEU.0000255373.57346.EC,Clinical Trial;Journal Article,"Adult;Aged;Cerebral Angiography;Female;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional/*instrumentation;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/*diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Angiography;Male;Middle Aged;Monitoring, Intraoperative/*instrumentation/methods;Neuronavigation/*instrumentation/methods;Neurosurgical Procedures/adverse effects/*instrumentation;Prospective Studies;Ultrasonography, Interventional/instrumentation",
25815632,Multimodal treatment strategies for complex pediatric cerebral arteriovenous fistulas: contemporary case series at Barrow Neurological Institute.,"OBJECT Pediatric cerebral arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) are rare but potentially lethal vascular lesions. Management strategies for these lesions have undergone considerable evolution in the last decade with the advent of new endovascular, surgical, and radiosurgical technologies. This study sought to review current treatment strategies and long-term clinical outcomes at a high-volume cerebrovascular institute. METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed on patients with a diagnosis of cerebral AVF from 1999 to 2012. Patients with carotid-cavernous fistulas, vein of Galen malformations, and age > 18 years were excluded from final analysis. Medical history, surgical and nonsurgical treatment, and clinical outcomes were documented. Pre- and postoperative angiograms were analyzed to assess for obliteration of the fistula. RESULTS Seventeen patients with pial AVFs (29.4%), dural AVFs (64.7%), or mixed pial/dural AVFs (5.9%) were identified. The majority of lesions were paramedian (70.6%) and supratentorial (76.5%). The study population had a mean age of 6.4 years, with a slight male predominance (52.9%), and the most common presenting symptoms were seizures (23.5%), headaches (17.6%), congestive heart failure (11.7%), and enlarging head circumference (11.7%). Among patients who underwent intervention (n = 16), 56.3% were treated with endovascular therapy alone, 6.3% were treated with open surgery alone, and 37.5% required a multimodal approach. Overall, 93.8% of the treated patients received endovascular treatment, 43.8% received open surgery, and 12.5% received radiosurgery. Endovascular embolysates included Onyx (n = 5), N-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA; n = 4), or coil embolization (n = 7) with or without balloon assistance (n = 2). Complete angiographic obliteration was achieved in 87.5% at the last follow-up evaluation (mean follow-up 3.1 years). One infant with incomplete AVF obliteration died of congestive heart failure, and 1 patient with complete obliteration died of acute sinus thrombosis, with an overall complication rate of 18.8%. CONCLUSIONS Pediatric cerebral AVFs are challenging neurosurgical lesions. Although advancements in endovascular therapy in the last decade have greatly changed the natural course of this disease, a multidisciplinary approach remains necessary for a large subset of patients.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Series which is shown here consists of 39 patients which were hospitalized in the institute for neurosurgery of the Clinical Center of Serbia in the period between 1995 and 2004. This group was exposed to symptomatic therapy or it was estimated that surgery, embolization and radio surgery. RESULTS: Combined type of venous drainage brings a high risk (p < 0.001) from repeated bleeding. Combined artery bringing from different flows (p < 0.05) contributes to genesis of 'steal phenomenon', in combination with deep venous drainage it presents predisposing anatomical characteristics for repeated bleeding (p < 0.001) according to our results should present AVM with dimensions 2.5 to 5 cm localized in eloquent zone of big brain with combined type of venous drainage and cobined artery bringing from vertebro-basilar flow and carotid flow. CONCLUSION: Perception of natural course of AVM point to certainly more benign pathology in regard to other vascular malformations.

11744782,Verbal encoding deficits in a patient with a left retrosplenial lesion.,"Over the past decade, memory impairments associated with retrosplenial damage have received increased attention among neuroscientists, although the exact role of the retrosplenial region in memory has not been clearly defined. Evidence from lesion studies and functional neuroimaging has implicated the retrosplenial region in verbal episodic memory, temporal ordering of information, and topographical memory. In addition, recent positron emission tomography studies have shown increased activation of the retrosplenial cortex during tasks involving both the encoding and retrieval of episodic information. The objective of this study was to define more clearly the nature of memory impairments observed in retrosplenial amnesia. A 47-year-old amnesic male with a left retrosplenial arteriovenous malformation was examined on neurocognitive tasks of automatic and directed encoding, temporal ordering of information, and remote memory. Despite normal performance on frontal cognitive tasks, intact memory for remote information, and a superior IQ, this individual exhibited a profound deficit in the encoding of information, evidenced by poor release from proactive interference, poor category clustering on word list recall, poor semantic encoding on a levels of processing task, and mild impairments in temporal ordering. These results imply that the retrosplenial region plays a role in the verbal encoding of information, which contributes to the profound verbal memory impairment reported in previous case studies of patients with retrosplenial damage.",2001,2001,Neurocase,7,5,407-17,eng,False,10.1076/neur.7.5.407.16250,"Case Reports;Journal Article;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","Adult;Amnesia/diagnosis/*physiopathology;Brain Damage, Chronic/diagnosis/physiopathology;Brain Mapping;Cerebral Cortex/*physiopathology;Corpus Callosum/*physiopathology;Embolization, Therapeutic;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intelligence/physiology;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/*physiopathology/therapy;Male;Mental Recall/*physiology;Middle Aged;Neuropsychological Tests;Postoperative Complications/diagnosis/physiopathology;Proactive Inhibition;Radiosurgery;Retreatment;Serial Learning/physiology;Tomography, Emission-Computed;Verbal Learning/*physiology",
19834376,The protective status of subtotal obliteration of arteriovenous malformations after radiosurgery: significance and risk of hemorrhage.,"OBJECTIVE: Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) treated by radiosurgery with complete obliteration of the nidus but a persisting early draining vein on follow-up angiography can be termed subtotally obliterated. However, these are persistent circulating AVMs. The significance of these lesions, their hemorrhage rate, and their management are analyzed. METHODS: In a series of 862 consecutive patients with AVMs treated by radiosurgery, 121 patients (14%) achieved subtotal obliteration (STO). The angiographic evolution and rate of obliteration were studied. The pretreatment angiographic features, dosimetric parameters, and postradiosurgery hemorrhage rate were compared with those in the rest of the treated population. Finally, the options for follow-up and treatment were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 121 subtotally obliterated AVMs, the bleeding rate was 0%; 53% of patients achieved complete obliteration. This occurred in 71% of those who had STO at 1 year. In the cases in which STO was detected at 2, 3, and 4 years, total obliteration eventually occurred in 43%, 28.5%, and 0%, respectively. Comparative analysis with AVMs in which a part of the nidus persisted showed a significant difference in the bleeding rate. Except for volume, no significant statistical difference in angiographic and dosimetric parameters was found between the STO group and the rest of the studied population with residual nidus. Six cases received further treatment, resulting in 2 cures and 2 treatment-related complications. CONCLUSION: Subtotally obliterated AVMs are different from other partially obliterated AVMs, with a 0% bleeding rate. Their complete obliteration is a function of delay of appearance on follow-up angiography. Invasive follow-up and further treatment of these AVMs do not seem warranted.",2009 Oct,2009,Neurosurgery,65,4,709-17; discussion 717-8,eng,False,10.1227/01.NEU.0000348546.47242.5D;00006123-200910000-00009;10.1227/01.NEU.0000348546.47242.5D,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Cerebral Angiography/standards;Cerebral Arteries/abnormalities/physiopathology/surgery;Cerebral Hemorrhage/*epidemiology/physiopathology/prevention & control;Cerebral Veins/abnormalities/physiopathology/surgery;Child;Comorbidity;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*epidemiology/physiopathology/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Postoperative Hemorrhage/*epidemiology/physiopathology/prevention & control;Radiation Dosage;Radiosurgery/*statistics & numerical data;Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted;Risk Assessment;Risk Factors;Time Factors;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",

In this paper, the authors report their experience with the use of a compliant balloon to assist the microcatheter navigation in AVMs supplied by feeders with recurrent configuration. Eight patients with AVMs supplied by recurrent feeders had unsuccessful microcatheter navigation after multiple attempts to catheterize the pedicle. A compliant balloon was inflated in the parent artery immediately after the origin of the feeder. The microcatheter was then advanced over the wire while the balloon provided support for the navigation. Distal access close to the nidus was achieved in all cases. Anatomical cure was documented in 75% cases. There were no arterial perforations or thromboembolic events. The described technique is a straightforward method for providing support to microcatheter navigation in certain cases of cerebral AVMs supplied by recurrent arterial feeders.

20885108,Role of γ knife radiosurgery in neurosurgery: past and future perspectives.,"The gamma knife was the first radiosurgical device developed at the Karolinska Institute in 1967. Stereotactic radiosurgery using the gamma knife has been widely accepted in clinical practice and has contributed to the development of neurosurgery. More than 500,000 patients have been treated by gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery so far, and the method is now an indispensable neurosurgical tool. Here we review long-term outcomes and development of stereotactic radiosurgery using the gamma knife and discuss its future perspectives. The primary role of stereotactic radiosurgery is to control small well-demarcated lesions such as metastatic brain tumors, meningiomas, schwannomas, and pituitary adenomas while preserving the function of surrounding brain tissue. The gamma knife has been used as a primary treatment or in combination with surgery, and some applications have been accepted as standard treatment in the field of neurosurgery. Treatment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations has also been drastically changed after emergence of this technology. Controlling functional disorders is another role of stereotactic radiosurgery. There is a risk of radiation-induced adverse events, which are usually mild and less frequent. However, especially in large or invasive lesions, those risks are not negligible and pose limitations. Advancement of irradiation technology and dose planning software have enabled more sophisticated and safer treatment, and further progress will contribute to better treatment outcomes not only for brain lesions but also for cervical lesions with less invasive treatment.",2010,2010,Neurologia medico-chirurgica,50,9,737-48,eng,False,JST.JSTAGE/nmc/50.737;10.2176/nmc.50.737,Journal Article;Review,Brain/pathology/physiopathology/*surgery;Brain Diseases/pathology/physiopathology/*surgery;Brain Neoplasms/pathology/physiopathology/surgery;Forecasting;Humans;Neurosurgery/*methods/trends;Radiosurgery/*methods/trends,
37405688,"Epilepsy associated with cerebral cavernous malformations managed with stereotactic radiosurgery: an international, multicenter study.","OBJECTIVE: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has been proposed as an alternative to resection for epilepsy control in patients with cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM) located in critical areas. METHODS: This multicentric, retrospective study evaluated seizure control in patients with a solitary CCM and a history of at least one seizure prior to SRS. RESULTS: 109 patients (median age at diagnosis 28.9 years, interquartile range (IQR) 16.4 years] were included. Prior to SRS, 2 (1.8%) were seizure-free without medication, 35 (32.1%) were seizure-free with antiseizure medications (ASM), 17 (15.6%) experienced an improvement of at least 50% in seizure frequency/intensity with ASM, and 55 (50.5%) experienced an improvement of less than 50% in seizure frequency/intensity with ASM. At a median follow-up of 3.5 years post-SRS (IQR: 4.9), 52 (47.7%) patients were Engel class I, 13 (11.9%) class II, 17 (15.6%) class III, 22 (20.2%) class IVA or IVB and 5 (4.6%) class IVC. For the 72 patients who had seizures despite medication prior to SRS, a delay > 1.5 years between epilepsy presentation and SRS decreased the probability to become seizure-free, HR 0.25 (95% CI 0.09-0.66), p = 0.006. The probability of achieving Engel I at the last follow-up was 23.6 (95% CI 12.7-33.1) and 31.3% (95% CI 19.3-50.8) at 2 and 5 years respectively. 27 patients were considered as having drug-resistant epilepsy.

18543787,Role of neuronavigation in the resection of intracranial arteriovenous malformations.,"AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of neuronavigation on the following parameters: ""skin incision"", ""craniotomy"", ""intraoperative anatomical orientation"", ""dissection guiding"", ""localization of the pathological formation"", ""assessment of the degree of resection"" and ""duration of surgical procedure"" in the resection of intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and to specify the indications for application of neuronavigation in the surgical treatment of AVMs. METHODS: Five neuronavigation-assisted resections of intracranial AVMs were performed between March 2003 and December 2005 at the Clinic of Neurosurgery of St. I. Rilsky University Hospital, Medical University, Sofia. The female/male ratio in the series was 2:3 (40%:60%). The patients' mean age was 28.2 +/- 18.27 (range 10 to 56) years. The study was prospective in design. Patients were examined and followed in a standardized manner. RESULTS: Arteriovenous malformations were totally removed in all 5 cases of neuronavigation-assisted resections. We did not observe any morbidity or mortality associated with the method. Neuronavigation allowed precise localization and individual design of the skin incision and craniotomy. Neuronavigation facilitated the surgeon during intraoperative anatomical orientation. Dissection guiding, localization of the formation and assessment of the degree of resection were assessed as markedly useful. This resulted in reduced duration of surgery compared to conventional neurosurgery. CONCLUSIONS: In AVMs resection neuronavigation optimizes surgical approach by visualizing the relationship ofAVMs to the skull and various critical anatomical structures. Deep vessel components and nidus margins, especially in the vicinity of the ventricles can be identified precisely. Neuronavigation can improve the early post-operative results in cerebral AVMs reducing operating time and blood loss.",2008,2008,Folia medica,50,1,40-5,eng,False,,Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Child;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Neuronavigation/*methods,
39023603,Analysis of the treatment planning metrics and their correlation with morphology of intracranial lesions in Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery.,"BACKGROUND: Gamma Knife Radiosurgery (GKRS) has established a role in treating various benign brain pathologies. The radiosurgery planning necessitates a proper understanding of radiation dose distribution in relation to the target lesion and surrounding eloquent area. The quality of a radiosurgery plan is determined by various planning parameters. Here, we have reviewed various GKRS planning parameters and analyzed their correlation with the morphology of treated brain lesions. METHOD: A total of 430 treatment plans (71 meningioma, 133 vestibular schwannoma/VS, 150 arteriovenous malformation/AVM, 76 pituitary adenoma/PA treated with GKRS between December 2013 and May 2023) were analyzed for target coverage (TC), conformity index (CI), homogeneity index (HI), and gradient index (GI). RESULT: The values of CIPaddick and CILomax for PA were lower and differed significantly from meningioma, VS, and AVM. The value of HI for PA was higher and differed significantly when compared with meningioma, VS, and AVM. The values of HI for AVM were also significantly higher than VS and meningioma. The mean GI was 3.02, 2.92, 3.03, and 2.88 for meningioma, VS, AVM, and PA, respectively. The value of GI for meningioma and AVM was significantly higher when compared with the values for VS and PA. The mean TC was 0.94 for meningioma, 0.96 for VS, 0.95 for AVM, and 0.90 for PA. The value TC of PA was lower and differed significantly when compared with VS, AVM, and meningioma. Lesions with a volume of ≤1 cc had poor planning metrics as the spillage of radiation may be higher. CONCLUSION: The GKRS planning parameters depend on the size, shape, nature, and location of intracranial lesions.

11404693,[Characteristics of headache associated with cerebral arteriovenous malformations].,"BACKGROUND: and purposes. The purpose of this study was to identify the specific characteristics of headaches associated with cerebral arteriovenous malformations in order to differentiate them from other known entities of headaches such as migraine, cluster headache, and trigeminal neuralgia. This differentiation allows an early diagnosis of cAVM and a treatment to be administrated before any cerebral hemorrhage. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 700 patients with cAVM and treated by radiosurgery. Out of this series, only 109 (48 males, 61 females, mean age of 33) presented with headaches. Headaches were studied as a possible revelation mode of a cAVM, either as an isolated sign, preceding an epileptic seizure, a cerebral hemorrhage, or associated with a neurological deficit. Analysis concerned 13 clinical parameters and 30 anatomic parameters based on angiography. RESULTS: Headaches were found in 15.6%; they were isolated in 6%. They preceded a cerebral hemorrhage in 12.6%, constituting an early alarm signal when increasing in intensity, frequency and duration. They were associated with seizures or a neurological deficit in 9.6%. We found a predominant female sex-ratio (0.78) and occurrence at a young age (72.3% between 10 and 40 years). Headaches were non-pulsating in 95.3%; nausea, vomiting, light or sound phobia were only found in 4.7%. Headaches were unilateral and homolateral to the malformation in 80%, corresponding to the malformation topography in 97.4% in posterior location and 80% in anterior location. Associated neurological symptoms existed in 20.2%; related to the malformation and lasting 5 to 30 minutes. Duration of pain episodes was less than 3 hours in 77% with a frequency of 1 to 2 per month in 82.5%. Pain was mild and responded to simple analgesics. A family migraine was found in only 3 patients. The angiographic characteristics of the malformations were meningeal afferences, superficial venous drainage and posterior location. CONCLUSIONS: Headaches associated with cerebral arterio-venous malformations form a distinct category that can be determined from specific characteristics; this should help an early diagnosis of cerebral arterio-venous malformations in order to start a treatment before the occurrence of cerebral hemorrhage.",2001 May,2001,Neuro-Chirurgie,47,2-3 Pt 2,177-83,fre,False,75809,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Age of Onset;Aged;Cerebral Angiography;Child;Diagnosis, Differential;Epilepsy/epidemiology/etiology;Female;Headache/classification/diagnosis;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*complications/diagnosis/diagnostic;Male;Middle Aged;Migraine Disorders/diagnosis;Nausea/epidemiology/etiology;Paris/epidemiology;Photophobia/epidemiology/etiology;Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Trigeminal Neuralgia/diagnosis;Vascular Headaches/diagnosis/epidemiology/*etiology",
18981883,Radiation tolerance limits of the brainstem.,"OBJECTIVE: One of the key limitations of gamma knife surgery arises from the radiation safety tolerance limit of the brainstem. The authors conducted an analysis of patients with intra-axial brainstem lesions and documented the incidence of adverse radiation imaging effects (ARIE) and new neurological deficits after gamma knife surgery. METHODS: Thirty-eight patients (39 lesions) with intra-axial brainstem astrocytomas or vascular malformations underwent gamma knife surgery during a 6-year interval. Brainstem exposure volume was calculated by subtracting the volume within the 12-Gy isodose line (12 Gray volume) from the prescription volume. ARIE was defined as a new parenchymal signal alteration on follow-up magnetic resonance imaging sequences. RESULTS: The average prescription volume was 1.46 cm, 12 Gy volume was 2.03 cm, and brainstem exposure volume was 0.57 cm. Seven (18.4%) patients developed ARIE. ARIE correlated only with the presence of new neurological deficits and age younger than 40 years. Three (7.9%) patients developed minor residual deficits without any ARIE. There was no mortality. CONCLUSION: Exposure of the brainstem to more than 12 Gy at volumes as low as 0.1 cm can produce ARIE and new neurological deficits. The tolerance of the brainstem to radiosurgery is related to patient age, lesion volume, and pathology.

Consequences can be very various and serious. Our first purpose is to define the different types of hemorrhage. Our second purpose is to appreciate more precisely individual hemorragic risk of a cerebral arteriovenous malformation with the study of his angioarchitecture. We performed a prospective study in order to validate a logistic model and a classification previously described. PATIENTS: and method. From the whole series of 705 patients, 57% (n=394) suffered a parenchymal, subarachnoid or ventricular hemorrhage. Logistic model and classification of the hemorrhagic risk were prospectively tested on a consecutive population of 78 patients. Comparisons of theorical (calculated hemorrhagic risk) and real (hemorrhage or not) were performed by non parametric tests. RESULTS: Characteristics and clinical consequences of the hemorrhage were analyzed. Results of the prospective study confirmed data of the classification and showed a hemorrhage risk increasing with the grade: grade Ia 0%, grade Ib 30%, grade II 44%, grade III 57%, grade IV 88%.

24915068,Arterial and venous aneurysms associated with arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVE: To identify prioritization based on hemorrhagic risk and indications for treatment of arterial and venous aneurysms associated with arteriovenous malformation (AVM). METHODS: From a global series of 400 consecutively treated AVMs, 34 patients (8.5%) with 45 arterial or venous aneurysms were extrapolated. These 45 lesions were classified as unrelated aneurysms (n = 5 cases; 11.%), flow-related aneurysms (n = 18 cases; 40%), and intranidal and postnidal venous aneurysms (n = 22; 49.%). The 18 flow-related aneurysms were further divided into remote (n = 6 cases) and adjacent (n = 12 cases) types. Of 45 aneurysms associated with AVMs, 15 were unruptured with a 5-year mean follow-up. Various possible risk indicators were considered and measured by univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: During the follow-up period, 1 of 15 unruptured aneurysms bled, and the patient died. A significantly different bleeding incidence was found between unrelated aneurysm and flow-related aneurysm types (P = 0.002). Bleeding was significantly less probable in flow-related remote aneurysm type than in venous and flow-related adjacent aneurysm types (P = 0.007). The location of the aneurysm was the only true risk factor for bleeding; the other parameters had no influence on bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: In this series, different subtypes of aneurysms associated with AVMs had different clinical behaviors. The bleeding risk of the unrelated aneurysm and the flow-related remote aneurysm types should be considered almost the same as any other unruptured aneurysm. In other words, bleeding risk should be considered taking into account the parameters established by the International Study of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms (location, size, and morphology).

16466238,Preoperative silk suture embolization of cerebral and dural arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECT: The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of silk sutures as a medical implant when applied for the embolization of cerebral and dural arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). The facility of surgery and the clinical significance of complications related to preoperative silk suture embolization were evaluated immediately after surgery and at long-term follow up. METHODS: Thirty-four patients harboring 29 cerebral and five dural AVMs underwent embolization in which silk alone or in association with other agents was used. Medical and radiological records obtained in these 34 patients were reviewed retrospectively. The cerebral AVMs were classified according to the Spetzler-Martin grading system and the dural AVMs to the Djindjian grading system. The facility of the resection and the adverse outcomes, including new neurological deficits, hemorrhage, and fever, as well as histopathological evidence of vessel inflammatory changes, were determined in each case. In all 23 surgical cases, the AVM could be easily manipulated and excised. New temporary neurological deficits occurred in three patients. A high Spetzler-Martin grade was not associated with a higher incidence of new neurological deficits. One delayed-onset hemorrhage was detected after embolization. Fever was present in 24% of the patients. No sign of significant vasculitis or perivascular inflammation was found on radiological or histopathological examination. CONCLUSIONS: Silk sutures are safe embolic agents especially for proximal occlusion of AVM feeding vessels. New permanent neurological deficits were not encountered in this series. Fever was considered to be a minor, temporary side effect of silk suture embolization.",2001 Nov 15,2001,Neurosurgical focus,11,5,e6,eng,False,110506;10.3171/foc.2001.11.5.7,Evaluation Study;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Central Nervous System Vascular Malformations/surgery/*therapy;Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology;Child;Combined Modality Therapy;Cyanoacrylates/therapeutic use;Embolization, Therapeutic/adverse effects/instrumentation/*methods;Enbucrilate;Female;Fever/etiology;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/diagnostic;Male;Metals;Microspheres;Middle Aged;Polyvinyl Alcohol/therapeutic use;Postoperative Complications/etiology;Preoperative Care/*methods;Radiography;Radiosurgery;Recurrence;Retrospective Studies;Silk;*Suture Techniques/adverse effects;Treatment Outcome",
22437568,Presurgical planning for arteriovenous malformations using multidetector row CT.,"Microsurgical resection remains an important treatment for cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). We developed an accurate method for planning AVM resections using multidetector row CT (MDCT). Between January 2007 and January 2011, 21 consecutive patients with AVMs were enrolled in this study. Sixteen patients were symptomatic, and of these, 15 had a hemorrhagic onset. Preoperative CT angiography (CTA) was performed using an MDCT scanner (GE Lightspeed VCT; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA). In total, 1 to 1.2 mL/kg of iopamidol, a low-osmolar iodinated contrast material, was administered intravenously with the bolus tracking method. In all cases, three-dimensional CTA imaging demonstrated critical arterial feeders and their specific geometric associations with the nidus. Accurate visualization of the architecture of AVMs and surgical trajectory was possible with the volume rendering method, especially when using transparency imaging. Additionally, employing feeder extraction imaging with segmentation post-processing, clear preoperative identification of the feeding arteries around the surrounding structures allowed for not only intraoperative orientation but also planning for presurgical embolization. Moreover, the precise anatomical structures of the brain surface were obtained using fusion imaging with MRI. While it is difficult to scientifically assign a value to a technology, we sought to objectively assess the utility of the currently available CTA. The significant benefits of this modality for presurgical planning include enhanced surgeon confidence and optimization of the sequence of surgical procedures.",2012 Jul,2012,Neurosurgical review,35,3,393-9; discussion 399-400,eng,False,10.1007/s10143-012-0383-4;10.1007/s10143-012-0383-4,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Angiography, Digital Subtraction/methods;Cerebral Angiography/methods;Child;Child, Preschool;Embolization, Therapeutic/methods;Female;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional/instrumentation;Infant;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnostic imaging/surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Neuronavigation/instrumentation/methods;*Tomography, X-Ray Computed;Young Adult",
12383355,Role of frameless stereotaxy in the surgical treatment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations: technique and outcomes in a controlled study of 44 consecutive patients.,"OBJECTIVE: To describe a frameless stereotactic technique used to resect cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and to determine whether frameless stereotaxy during AVM resection could decrease operative times, minimize intraoperative blood losses, reduce postoperative complications, and improve surgical outcomes. METHODS: Data for 44 consecutive patients with surgically resected cerebral AVMs were retrospectively reviewed. The first 22 patients underwent resection without stereotaxy (Group 1), whereas the next 22 patients underwent resection with the assistance of a frameless stereotaxy system (Group 2). RESULTS: The patient characteristics, AVM morphological features, and percentages of preoperatively embolized cases were statistically similar for the two treatment groups. The mean operative time for Group 1 was 497 minutes, compared with 290 minutes for Group 2 (P = 0.0005). The estimated blood loss for Group 1 was 657 ml, compared with 311 ml for Group 2 (P = 0.0008). Complication rates, residual AVM incidences, and clinical outcomes were similar for the two groups. CONCLUSION: Frameless stereotaxy allows surgeons to 1) plan the optimal trajectory to an AVM, 2) minimize the skin incision and craniotomy sizes, and 3) confirm the AVM margins and identify deep vascular components during resection. These benefits of stereotaxy were most apparent for small, deep AVMs that were not visible on the surface of the brain. Frameless stereotaxy reduces the operative time and blood loss during AVM resection.",2002 Nov,2002,Neurosurgery,51,5,1108-16; discussion 1116-8,eng,False,10.1097/00006123-200211000-00002,Journal Article,Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Child;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;*Neuronavigation/methods;*Neurosurgical Procedures/adverse effects;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome,
19478223,4D radial acquisition contrast-enhanced MR angiography and intracranial arteriovenous malformations: quickly approaching digital subtraction angiography.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The current gold standard for imaging intracranial AVMs involves catheter-based techniques, namely cerebral digital subtraction angiography (DSA). However, DSA presents some procedural risks to the patient. Unfortunately, AVM patients usually undergo multiple DSA exams throughout their diagnostic and therapeutic course, significantly increasing their procedural risk exposure. As such, high-quality noninvasive imaging is desired. We hypothesize that 4D radial acquisition contrast-enhanced MRA approximates the vascular architecture and hemodynamics of AVMs compared to conventional angiography. METHODS: Thirteen consecutive AVM patients were assessed by 4D radial acquisition contrast-enhanced MRA and DSA. The 4D rCE-MRA images were independently assessed regarding the location, nidal size, Spetzler-Martin grade, and identification of arterial feeders, drainage pattern, and any other vascular anomalies. RESULTS: 4D rCE-MRA correctly depicted the size, venous drainage pattern, and prominent arterial feeders in all cases. Spetzler-Martin grade was correctly determined between reviewers and between the different imaging modalities in all cases except 1. The nidus size was in good correlation between the reviewers, where r=0.99, P<0.000001. There was very good agreement between reviewers regarding the individual scans (kappa=0.63 to 1), whereas the agreement between the DSA and 4D rCE-MRA images was also good (kappa=0.61 to 0.85). CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a 4D radial acquisition contrast-enhanced MRA sequence capable of imaging intracranial AVMs approximating that of DSA. Image analysis demonstrates equivalency in terms of grading AVMs using the Spetzler-Martin grading scale. This 4D rCE-MRA sequence has the potential to avoid some applications of DSA, thus saving patients from potential procedural risks.",2009 Aug,2009,Stroke,40,8,2749-53,eng,False,10.1161/STROKEAHA.108.546663;STROKEAHA.108.546663;10.1161/STROKEAHA.108.546663,"Comparative Study;Journal Article;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adult;Aged;Angiography, Digital Subtraction/*methods;*Contrast Media;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/*diagnostic imaging/surgery;Magnetic Resonance Angiography/*methods;Male;Middle Aged;Stereotaxic Techniques;Young Adult",
34992027,Strategic neuronavigation-guided emergent endoscopic evacuation of the hematoma caused by ruptured brain arteriovenous malformation: Technical note and retrospective case series.,"The treatment strategy for ruptured brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) in the acute phase is still controversial. We describe five consecutive cases of successful emergent endoscopic evacuation (EEE) of intracerebral hematoma (ICH) caused by ruptured bAVMs with the electromagnetic (EM)-neuronavigation system to avoid damage to the bAVMs intended to save valuable time in the emergent phase. A single-institution retrospective analysis was performed in patients with ruptured bAVMs treated by the EM-navigated EEE as part of the strategic multimodality therapy. EM-navigated EEE was performed as follows: 1) obtaining three-dimensional computed tomography to identify the location of the nidus, large draining vein, feeding artery, and hematoma; 2) using a supine position without rigid head fixation for both supra- and infratentorial hematoma; 3) planning the entry point and trajectory of the endoscope as far as possible from the location of the nidus using the EM-navigation system; 4) designing a linear skin incision line suitable for the endoscopic surgery as well as possible decompressive craniectomy; and 5) performing EM-navigated endoscopic partial evacuation of ICH. EM-navigated EEE of ICH was successfully performed for all 5 patients, resulting in partial removal of the ICH without rebleeding from bAVMs. The mean surgical time was 37 min. Subsequent strategic endovascular embolization and curative resection of bAVMs could be performed for all patients, achieving Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15. EM-navigated EEE of partial ICH may be valuable in the emergent phase of ruptured bAVMs with massive life-threatening ICH to reduce the intracranial pressure and to obtain better prognosis.",2022 Feb,2022,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society,96,,61-67,eng,False,S0967-5868(21)00607-X;10.1016/j.jocn.2021.12.013;S0967-5868(21)00607-X;10.1016/j.jocn.2021.12.013,Journal Article,*Arteriovenous Malformations;Brain;Hematoma/diagnostic imaging/etiology/surgery;Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/diagnostic;Neuronavigation;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome,Electromagnetic neuronavigation;Endoscopic surgery;Massive hematoma;Ruptured brain arteriovenous malformation
12234408,"Modified, multipurpose, radiolucent sugita head frame for intraoperative cerebral angiography.","OBJECTIVE: Although several radiolucent head-fixation devices have been developed to allow intraoperative cerebral angiography, no device provides satisfactory freedom to obtain the most suitable head position. We recently designed a multipurpose radiolucent Sugita head frame (modified radiolucent Sugita frame) with satisfactory degrees of freedom and rigidity for intraoperative head positioning and head holding, respectively. DESCRIPTION OF INSTRUMENTATION: A short arm and a ring joint, made of engineering plastic, were added to the prototype radiolucent Sugita frame, to permit side-tilting movements of the frame. The shape of all handles at the joints was also changed and the size was enlarged, to facilitate adjustment of the head position. EXPERIENCE AND RESULTS: We used this modified radiolucent Sugita frame in 20 cases involving aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations. The frame performed satisfactorily in all cases, in terms of firm head fixation and unrestrained freedom of head positioning at the surgeon's request. The modified radiolucent Sugita frame was evaluated with respect to its resistance to physical forces. The physical strength of the modified radiolucent Sugita frame is almost equivalent to that of the metallic Sugita frame and is considered sufficient for clinical usage. CONCLUSION: With its rigidity, satisfactory degrees of freedom, and ease of handling, the clinical applicability of the dramatically improved radiolucent head frame enables us to obtain satisfactory intraoperative angiograms.",2002 Oct,2002,Neurosurgery,51,4,989-92; discussion 992,eng,False,10.1097/00006123-200210000-00025,Journal Article,"Cerebral Angiography/*instrumentation/*methods;Equipment Design;*Head;Humans;Intracranial Aneurysm/diagnostic imaging/surgery;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/surgery;Intraoperative Period;Restraint, Physical/*instrumentation;*Stereotaxic Techniques/*instrumentation",
26342206,Ruptured cerebral arteriovenous malformations: Outcomes analysis after microsurgery.,"OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to evaluate the functional outcome and the risk of postoperative remnant in patients with rAVM after microsurgical treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective of 139 consecutive patients operated for a rAVM between 2002 and 2012 in our institution. The age at diagnosis and the WFNS score were recorded for each patient before treatment. All patients were re-evaluated 3 months after treatment using mRS scale. Conventional angiography was performed in the first 2 postoperative weeks and then a year later to detect any remnant or recurrence. RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis was 30.8 years (range 4-69 SD: ±5) and 44 patients had an age at diagnosis <18 yo. The mRS score 3 months after treatment was ≤2 in 104 patients (83%). Predictive factors of good functional outcome were age at diagnosis <25 yo, initial WFNS score ≤ 2, SPM grade ≤ 2 and absence of acute hydrocephalus (p<0.05). Complete obliteration was obtained in 123 patients (89.5%) after the first microsurgical treatment. Early postoperative conventional angiography revealed a rAVM remnant in 16 patients (10.5%). Late conventional angiography showed a recurrence in 6 patients (4.5%). All of them were <18 yo. Predictive factors of postoperative rAVM remnant were an initial WFNS score>2, SPM grade>2 and preoperative evaluation limited only to CT angiography in emergency situation (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Functional outcome after microsurgical treatment was good in 83% of patients with rAVM. Good results were also recorded in 28% of patients with poor initial neurological status and severe intracerebral hemorrhage, which required immediate surgery.

12232548,Arteriovenous malformations in the basal ganglia region: Gamma Knife radiosurgery as first choice treatment in selected cases.,"BACKGROUND: The authors report the results of Gamma Knife (GK) radiosurgery on a clinical series of selected patients with brain basal ganglia arteriovenous malformations (BG AVMs). Furthermore, clinico-epidemiological and anatomo-functional pictures of BG AVMs and supratentorial cortical AVMs are comparatively analyzed, and their influence on the radiosurgical outcome is discussed. METHODS: At our Department, 33 BG AVMs (21 with FU >2 years) and 209 cortical AVMs (110 with FU >2 years) with a radiosurgical volume 10 cc underwent GK from February 1993 to July 2001. Mean age, male/female ratio (M/F), and bleeding rate at clinical onset in the 2 subgroups of patients were as follows: 25.5 years (5-62 years), 16 M/17 F, and 30/33 (91%) in BG AVMs, respectively; 34.4 years (8-74 years), 124 M/85 F, and 107/209 (51%) in cortical AVMs, respectively. Statistical analysis performed with contingency table method and deviance analysis according to generalized linear models showed that the differences concerning age at onset and bleeding rate were highly significant. RESULTS: The rates of complete obliteration, permanent morbidity, bleeding/rebleeding during latency period, and unsuccessful embolization attempt in the 2 subgroups of patients were as follows: 81%, 4%, 8%, and 41.7% in BG AVMs, respectively; 85.5%, 2%, 2%, and 2% in cortical AVMs, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, the different clinico-epidemiological and anatomo-functional characteristics between BG AVMs and cortical AVMs do not seem to influence the radiosurgical outcome as complete obliteration and permanent neurological sequelae rates are very similar in these 2 subgroups of patients. GK radiosurgery may be considered the first choice treatment modality in BG AVMs with <10 cc volume (very high cure rate, very low permanent morbidity, and zero mortality). Although the haemorrhagic onset in BG AVMs is much more frequent than in cortical AVMs, the difference in the bleeding/rebleeding rate between the 2 subgroups of patients during the latency period is not statistically significant and this occurrence seems to be limited within the first year after GK.",2002 Jun,2002,Journal of neurosurgical sciences,46,2,43-54,eng,False,,Comparative Study;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Age Factors;Aged;Basal Ganglia/blood supply/pathology/*surgery;Brain Stem/blood supply/pathology/surgery;Cerebellum/blood supply/pathology/surgery;Cerebral Cortex/blood supply/pathology/*surgery;Cerebral Hemorrhage/complications;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/mortality/pathology/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Necrosis;Radiation Injuries/*pathology;*Radiosurgery/adverse effects;Treatment Outcome",
25446606,Automated voxel-based analysis of volumetric dynamic contrast-enhanced CT data improves measurement of serial changes in tumor vascular biomarkers.,"OBJECTIVES: Development of perfusion imaging as a biomarker requires more robust methodologies for quantification of tumor physiology that allow assessment of volumetric tumor heterogeneity over time. This study proposes a parametric method for automatically analyzing perfused tissue from volumetric dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) computed tomography (CT) scans and assesses whether this 4-dimensional (4D) DCE approach is more robust and accurate than conventional, region-of-interest (ROI)-based CT methods in quantifying tumor perfusion with preliminary evaluation in metastatic brain cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Functional parameter reproducibility and analysis of sensitivity to imaging resolution and arterial input function were evaluated in image sets acquired from a 320-slice CT with a controlled flow phantom and patients with brain metastases, whose treatments were planned for stereotactic radiation surgery and who consented to a research ethics board-approved prospective imaging biomarker study. A voxel-based temporal dynamic analysis (TDA) methodology was used at baseline, at day 7, and at day 20 after treatment. The ability to detect changes in kinetic parameter maps in clinical data sets was investigated for both 4D TDA and conventional 2D ROI-based analysis methods. RESULTS: A total of 7 brain metastases in 3 patients were evaluated over the 3 time points. The 4D TDA method showed improved spatial efficacy and accuracy of perfusion parameters compared to ROI-based DCE analysis (P<.005), with a reproducibility error of less than 2% when tested with DCE phantom data. Clinically, changes in transfer constant from the blood plasma into the extracellular extravascular space (Ktrans) were seen when using TDA, with substantially smaller errors than the 2D method on both day 7 post radiation surgery (±13%; P<.05) and by day 20 (±12%; P<.04). Standard methods showed a decrease in Ktrans but with large uncertainty (111.6 ± 150.5) %.

11355578,[Automatic definition of prescription isodose for stereotaxic radiation of arteriovenous malformations].,"PURPOSE: To evaluate dosimetric consequences generated by the automatic definition based on lesion coverage of prescription isodose. A clinical series of 124 arteriovenous malformations was analysed. Plan quality was quantified by the standard deviation of the differential dose volume histogram calculated in the lesion. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We define two quantitative protocols based on lesion coverage for the automatic definition of prescription isodose using a volumetric definition of coverage (90% of lesion volume), and an isodose-based definition proposed by RTOG (prescription isodose equals minimum isodose in the lesion divided by 0.9). RESULTS: We have evaluated the plans obtained for these two protocols, calculating several dose-volume indices. These indices are presented as a function of dose-volume histogram standard deviation in order to quantify the consequences of their variations for this representative series of plans. The margin our team tolerates is such that the sum of underdosed lesion and overdosed healthy tissues factors remains lower than one. Protocol based on volumetric coverage gives results situated within this margin. Protocol based on RTOG definition produces conformation indices that could be greater than 1. CONCLUSION: The absolute dose would be decided taking into account examined dose-volume indices and clinical data. A protocol for automatic definition of prescription isodose using volumetric lesion coverage seems to be more judiciously adapted to arteriovenous malformation conformal plans in stereotactic conditions because of variations observed in the overdosage of healthy tissues.",2001 Apr,2001,Cancer radiotherapie : journal de la Societe francaise de radiotherapie,5,2,138-49,fre,False,S1278321800000536;10.1016/s1278-3218(00)00053-6,Comparative Study;English Abstract;Journal Article,"Algorithms;Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*radiotherapy;Prescriptions;Radiometry/*methods;*Radiotherapy Dosage;*Stereotaxic Techniques",

21601376,Toxicity of gamma knife radiosurgery in the treatment of intracranial tumors in patients with collagen vascular diseases or multiple sclerosis.,"PURPOSE: To assess toxicity in patients with either a collagen vascular disease (CVD) or multiple sclerosis (MS) treated with intracranial radiosurgery. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between January 2004 and April 2009, 6 patients with MS and 14 patients with a CVD were treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for intracranial tumors. Treated lesions included 15 total brain metastases in 7 patients, 11 benign brain tumors, 1 low grade glioma, and 1 cavernous malformation. Toxicities were graded by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Acute/Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria. ""Rare toxicities"" were characterized as those reported in the scientific literature at an incidence of <5%. RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 16 months. Median dose to the tumor margin was 13.0 Gy (range, 12-21 Gy). Median size of tumor was 5.0 cm(3) (range, 0.14-7.8 cm(3)). Of the 14 patients with CVD, none experienced a Grade 3 or 4 toxicity or a toxicity characterized as rare. Of the 6 patients with MS, 3 experienced rare toxicities, and two of these were Grade 3 toxicities. Rare complications included a patient experiencing both communicating hydrocephalus and facial nerve palsy, as well as 2 additional patients with motor cranial nerve palsy. High-grade toxicities included the patient with an acoustic neuroma requiring ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement for obstructive hydrocephalus, and 1 patient with a facial nerve schwannoma who experienced permanent facial nerve palsy. Interval between radiosurgery and high-grade toxicities ranged from 1 week to 4 months.

18988912,Pathomechanisms of symptomatic developmental venous anomalies.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although it is generally accepted that developmental venous anomalies (DVAs) are benign vascular malformations, over the past years, we have seen patients with symptomatic DVAs. Therefore, we performed a retrospective study and a literature study to review how, when, and why DVAs can become clinically significant. METHODS: Charts and angiographic films of 17 patients with DVAs whose 18 vascular symptoms could be attributed to a DVA were selected from a neurovascular databank of our hospital. MRI had to be available to rule out any other associated disease. In the literature, 51 cases of well-documented symptomatic DVAs were found. Pathomechanisms were divided into mechanical and flow-related causes. RESULTS: Mechanical (obstructive or compressive) pathomechanisms accounted for 14 of 69 symptomatic patients resulting in hydrocephalus or nerve compression syndromes. Flow-related pathomechanisms (49 of 69 patients) could be subdivided into complications resulting from an increase of flow into the DVA (owing to an arteriovenous shunt using the DVA as the drainage route; n=19) or a decrease of outflow (n=26) or a remote shunt with increased venous pressure (n=4) leading to symptoms of venous congestion. In 6 cases, no specific pathomechanisms were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Although DVAs should be considered benign, under rare circumstances, they can be symptomatic. DVAs, as extreme variations of normal venous drainage, may represent a more fragile venous drainage system that can be more easily affected by in- and outflow alterations. The integrity of the DVA needs to be preserved irrespective of the treatment that should be tailored to the specific pathomechanism.",2008 Dec,2008,Stroke,39,12,3201-15,eng,False,10.1161/STROKEAHA.108.521799;STROKEAHA.108.521799;10.1161/STROKEAHA.108.521799,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Arteriovenous Fistula/etiology;Blood Pressure;Central Nervous System Venous Angioma/complications/*physiopathology/therapy;Child;Child, Preschool;Embolization, Therapeutic;Female;Hemorheology;Humans;Hydrocephalus/etiology;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/physiopathology;Male;Middle Aged;Nerve Compression Syndromes/etiology;Paresis/etiology;Radiosurgery;Seizures/etiology;Stress, Mechanical;Stroke/etiology",
36933254,"Clinical presentation, hemorrhage risk, and outcome in patients with familial cavernous malformations: a pragmatic prospective analysis of 75 patients.","OBJECTIVE: Newly diagnosed patients with a familial cavernous malformation (FCM) and their families are concerned about their future outlook, which is scarcely discussed in the literature. The authors studied a prospective contemporary cohort of patients with FCMs to assess demographics, mode of presentation, prospective risk of hemorrhage and seizures, need for surgery, and functional outcome over an extended interval. METHODS: A prospectively maintained database beginning January 1, 2015, of patients diagnosed with a cavernous malformation (CM) was queried. Data on demographics, radiological imaging, and symptoms at first diagnosis were collected in adult patients who gave their consent to prospective contact. Follow-up was done using questionnaires, in-person visits, and medical record review to assess for prospective symptomatic hemorrhage (i.e., the first hemorrhage after enrollment in the database), seizure, functional outcome measured by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), and treatment. The prospective hemorrhage rate was calculated by the number of prospective hemorrhages divided by patient-years of follow-up censored at last follow-up, first prospective hemorrhage, or death. A Kaplan-Meier curve of survival free of hemorrhage was obtained comparing patients with versus without hemorrhage at the time of presentation and compared with a log-rank test for p < 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 75 patients with FCM were included, of whom 60% were female. The mean age at diagnosis was 41 ± 16 years. Most symptomatic or large lesions were located supratentorially. At first diagnosis, 27 patients had no symptoms, and the remaining were symptomatic. Over an average of 9.9 years, the rate of prospective hemorrhage was 4.0% per patient-year, and the rate of new seizure was 1.2% per patient-year, with 64% and 32% of patients experiencing at least one symptomatic hemorrhage and at least one seizure, respectively. Thirty-eight percent of the patients underwent at least 1 surgery and 5.3% underwent stereotactic radiosurgery. At the last follow-up, 83.0% of patients remained independent with an mRS score ≤ 2. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' findings provide clinically useful information on hemorrhage rate, seizure rate, the likelihood of surgery, and functional outcome. These findings can be helpful to practicing physicians when counseling patients with FCM and their families, who are often apprehensive about their future and well-being.",2023 Oct 1,2023,Journal of neurosurgery,139,4,1018-1024,eng,False,10.3171/2023.1.JNS222434;10.3171/2023.1.JNS222434,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adult;Humans;Female;Middle Aged;Male;*Hemangioma, Cavernous, Central Nervous System/complications/diagnostic;Seizures/etiology/surgery;*Radiosurgery/methods;Cerebral Hemorrhage/surgery;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery;Treatment Outcome;Follow-Up Studies",clinical presentation;familial cavernous malformations;prognosis;vascular disorders

25525933,Use of intraoperative Doppler ultrasound with neuronavigation to guide arteriovenous malformation resection: a pediatric case series.,"OBJECT: Over the last 20 years, several intraoperative adjuncts, including ultrasonography, neuronavigation, and angiography, have been said to aid the intraoperative localization and resection of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). The authors assessed the value of intraoperative Doppler ultrasonography in conjunction with neuronavigation during surgery for cerebral AVMs in the pediatric population. METHODS: The authors reviewed all cranial AVM resections performed by a single surgeon at their institution in the period from 2007 to 2013 and here describe their experience and results in a series of 20 consecutive AVM resections in 19 pediatric patients. Intraoperative Doppler ultrasonography had been used in conjunction with preoperative CT or neuronavigational MRI. Preoperative and postoperative clinical findings, patient age, and Spetzler-Martin AVM grade were identified in all patients. RESULTS: All patients, whose ages ranged from 2 to 16 years, underwent craniotomy and excision of an AVM, which was supratentorial in 18 cases and infratentorial in 2. Patients in 11 cases underwent preoperative embolization, and all other patients underwent cerebral angiography prior to surgery, except for 2 patients who were urgently surgically treated because of low Glasgow Coma Scale scores and associated hematoma. Spetzler-Martin Grades I (3 cases), II (6), III (7), and IV (4) AVMs were represented in this series. Intraoperative Doppler ultrasound provided high-quality images in all cases and demonstrated the location, size, and flow characteristics of the AVM and any associated hematoma. Delayed postoperative cerebral angiography demonstrated successful AVM resection in all cases. An assessment of clinical outcomes revealed no new long-term neurological deficits at 3 months postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative Doppler ultrasonography is a reliable and useful tool for intraoperative localization and guidance for AVM resection in the pediatric population. When used in conjunction with neuronavigation equipment and modern microscopes, this technique has shown a very high complete resection rate with extremely low associated morbidity.",2015 Mar,2015,Journal of neurosurgery.

26406791,Long-term treatment outcome of venous-predominant arteriovenous malformation.,"OBJECTIVE: Treatment strategies for venous-predominant arteriovenous malformation (vp-AVM) remain unclear due to the limited number of cases and a lack of long-term outcomes. The purpose of this study was to report the authors' experience with treatment outcomes with a review of the pertinent literature in patients with vp-AVM. METHODS: Medical and radiological data from 1998 to 2011 were retrospectively evaluated. The degree of the arteriovenous (AV) shunt was categorized into 2 groups, a high- and low-flow AV shunt based on the angiographic findings. RESULTS: Sixteen patients with a mean age of 45.3 years (range 16-78 years) and a mean follow-up of 79.9 months (range 25-264 months) were examined. Symptomatic lesions were noted in 13 patients: intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in 9, seizure in 1, and headache in 3. A high-flow shunt was observed on angiography in 13 patients. Among these 13 patients, 12 patients were symptomatic. Nine patients presenting with ICH underwent hematoma removal with additional Gamma Knife surgery (GKS; n = 4), GKS only (n = 2), or conservative treatment (n = 3). The 3 asymptomatic patients received conservative treatment, and 1 rebleeding episode was observed. Seven of 8 patients who underwent GKS as an initial or secondary treatment modality experienced a marked reduction in the AV shunt on follow-up angiography, but complete obliteration was not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Poor lesion localization makes a vp-AVM challenging to treat. Symptomatic patients with a high-flow shunt are supposedly best treated with GKS, despite the fact that only 87.5% of the vp-AVMs treated this way showed a reduction in the malformation volume, and none were cured.",2016 Apr,2016,Journal of neurosurgery,124,4,1100-6,eng,False,10.3171/2015.4.JNS142475;10.3171/2015.4.JNS142475,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Arteriovenous Shunt, Surgical;Cerebral Angiography;Cerebral Veins/*abnormalities;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Hematoma/etiology/surgery;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Intracranial Hemorrhages/epidemiology/etiology;Male;Middle Aged;Migraine with Aura/etiology;Neurosurgical Procedures;Postoperative Complications/epidemiology;Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",AV = arteriovenous;AVM = arteriovenous malformation;DVA = developmental venous anomaly;GKS = Gamma Knife surgery;ICH = intracranial hemorrhage;arteriovenous malformation;developmental venous anomaly;intracranial hemorrhage;vascular disorders;venous malformation;vp-AVM = venous-predominant AVM

METHODS: Between 1987 and 2006, we performed Gamma Knife SRS on 996 patients with brain arteriovenous malformations; 407 patients had sustained an arteriovenous malformation hemorrhage. Sixty-four patients (16%) underwent prior embolization and 84 (21%) underwent prior surgical resection. The median target volume was 2.3 mL (range, 0.1-20.7 mL). The median margin dose was 20 Gy (range, 13.5-27 Gy). RESULTS: The overall rate of total obliteration defined by angiography or MRI was 56%, 77%, 80%, and 82% at 3, 4, 5, and 10 years, respectively. Before obliteration, 33 patients (8%) sustained an additional hemorrhage after SRS. The overall annual hemorrhage rate until obliteration after SRS was 1.3%. The presence of a patent aneurysm was significantly associated with an increased rehemorrhage risk after SRS (annual hemorrhage rate, 6.4%) compared with patients with a clipped or embolized aneurysm (annual hemorrhage rate, 0.8%; P=0.033).

15352595,Do the morphological characteristics of arteriovenous malformations affect the results of radiosurgery?,"OBJECT: The authors sought to determine which morphological features of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are statistically predictive of preradiosurgical hemorrhage, postradiosurgical hemorrhage, and neuroimaging-defined failure of radiosurgical treatment. In addition, correlation between computerized tomography (CT) scanning and angiography for the identification of AVM structures was investigated. METHODS: Archived CT dosimetry and available angiographic and clinical data for 268 patients in whom AVMs were treated with linear accelerator radiosurgery were retrospectively reviewed. Many of the morphological features of AVMs, including location, volume, compact or diffuse nidus, neovascularity, ease of nidus identification, number of feeding arteries, location (deep or superficial) of feeding arteries, number of draining veins, deep or superficial venous drainage, venous stenoses, venous ectasias, and the presence of intranidal aneurysms, were analyzed. In addition, a number of patient and treatment factors, including patient age, presenting symptoms, radiation dose, repeated treatment, and radiological outcome, were subjected to multivariate analyses. Two hundred twenty-seven patients were treated with radiosurgery for the first time and 41 patients underwent repeated radiosurgery. Eighty-one patients presented with a history of AVM hemorrhage and 91 patients had AVMs in a periventricular location. Twenty-six patients (10%) experienced a hemorrhage following radiosurgery. Of the 268 patients, 81 (30%) experienced angiographically defined cures, and 37 (14%) experienced MR imaging-defined cures. Eighty-six patients (32%) experienced neuroimaging-defined treatment failure, and 64 underwent insufficiently long follow up. A larger AVM volume (odds ratio [OR] 0.349; p = 0.004) was associated with a decreased rate of pretreatment hemorrhage, whereas periventricular location (OR 6.358; p = 0.000) was associated with an increased rate of pretreatment hemorrhage. None of the analyzed factors was predictive of hemorrhage following radiosurgery. A higher radiosurgical dose was strongly correlated with neuroimaging-defined success (OR 3.743; p = 0.006), whereas a diffuse nidus structure (OR 0.246; p = 0.008) and associated neovascularity (OR 0.428; p = 0.048) were each associated with a lower neuroimaging-defined cure rate. A strong correlation between CT scanning and angiography was noted for both nidus structure (p = 0.000; Fisher exact test) and neovascularity (p = 0.002; Fisher exact test). CONCLUSIONS: Patients presenting with AVMs that are small or periventricular were at higher risk for experiencing hemorrhage. A higher radiosurgical dose correlated strongly with neuroimaging-defined success. Patients in whom the AVM had a diffuse structure or associated neovascularity were at higher risk for neuroimaging-defined failure of radiosurgery.

14705968,"Fractionated, stereotactic proton beam treatment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations.","OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the therapeutic efficiency and adverse effects of stereotactic proton beam treatment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-six patients treated in Uppsala during 1991-97 were included (men = 14, women = 12; mean age = 39, range = 23-64). The nidus volumes ranged from 0.3 to 102 ml (mean = 24, median = 13). The follow-up included clinical evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging (and/or computed tomography) every 6-12 months for 3 years and final angiography. RESULTS: The volume changes at final follow-up in AVMs >25 ml were -89, -85, -44, -29, -7, 0, 0, +5 and +18 (%); in AVMs 11-24 ml, -100, -100, -97, -92 and 0 (%); and in AVMs <10 ml, -100, -100, -100, -100, -100, -99, -98, -50, -0 and +40 (%). Two patients were lost to follow-up due to cerebral haemorrhage and myocardial infarction. Radiology displayed significant perifocal oedema in one patient and slight oedema in four patients. Of nine patients with epilepsy, seven became seizure-free after therapy while two continued to suffer from seizures. CONCLUSION: Proton beam irradiation is successful in a relatively high proportion of intermediate and large-sized cerebral AVMs. The adverse effects are acceptable. The advantage of proton treatment compared with gamma knife and LINAC stereotactic irradiation is that protons can irradiate even large volumes with a very sharp dose profile against normal surroundings. Thus, proton beam irradiation is a valuable option in the treatment of AVMs larger than 10 ml.",2004 Feb,2004,Acta neurologica Scandinavica,109,2,85-90,eng,False,154;10.1046/j.1600-0404.2003.00154.x,"Clinical Trial;Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adult;Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology;Dose Fractionation, Radiation;Edema/etiology;Epilepsy/etiology;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Proton Therapy;Stereotaxic Techniques;Tomography, X-Ray Computed;Treatment Outcome",
15794825,Operation of arteriovenous malformations assisted by stereoscopic navigation-controlled display of preoperative magnetic resonance angiography and intraoperative ultrasound angiography.,"OBJECTIVE: To study the application of navigated stereoscopic display of preoperative three-dimensional (3-D) magnetic resonance angiography and intraoperative 3-D ultrasound angiography in a clinical setting. METHODS: Preoperative magnetic resonance angiography and intraoperative ultrasound angiography are presented as stereoscopic images on the monitor during the operation by a simple red/blue technique. Two projections are generated, one for each eye, according to a simple ray casting method. Because of integration with a navigation system, it is possible to identify vessels with a pointer. The system has been applied during operations on nine patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Seven of the patients had AVMs in an eloquent area. RESULTS: The technology makes it easier to understand the vascular architecture during the operation, and it offers a possibility to identify and clip AVM feeders both on the surface and deep in the tissue at the beginning of the operation. All 28 feeders identified on the preoperative angiograms were identified by intraoperative navigated stereoscopy. Twenty-five were clipped at the beginning of the operation. The other three were clipped at a later phase of the operation. 3-D ultrasound angiography was useful to map the size of the nidus, to detect the degree of brain shift, and to identify residual AVM. CONCLUSION: Stereoscopic visualization enhances the surgeon's perception of the vascular architecture, and integrated with navigation technology, this offers a reliable system for identification and clipping of AVM feeders in the initial phase of the operation.",2005 Apr,2005,Neurosurgery,56,2 Suppl,281-90; discussion 281-90,eng,False,10.1227/01.neu.0000157005.51053.41,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adult;Equipment Design;Female;Humans;*Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/*surgery;*Magnetic Resonance Angiography;Male;Middle Aged;*Monitoring, Intraoperative/methods;Neuronavigation;*Neurosurgical Procedures;Retrospective Studies;*Surgery, Computer-Assisted/instrumentation;Treatment Outcome;*Ultrasonography",

A 57-year-old man presented with sudden onset of diplopia and tinnitus. Computed tomography revealed a small hemorrhage in the right tectum mesencephali with intraventricular hemorrhage. Magnetic resonance imaging and angiography disclosed AVM in the right occipital lobe which was separate from the hemorrhagic lesion. Angiography demonstrated that the right occipital AVM was fed by the parieto-occipital artery and drained into the superior sagittal sinus and vein of Galen. However, no abnormal vascular lesion was detected near the tectum mesencephali. As venous hypertension was considered the reason for hemorrhage, the occipital AVM was completely resected. Postoperative angiography demonstrated disappearance of the occipital AVM, but it also disclosed a small tectal AVM fed by branches from the superior cerebellar artery, which had not been detected on preoperative angiography. This was considered the true cause of hemorrhage, and gamma knife surgery was accordingly performed.

The mean follow-up was 65 ± 44 months (median, 54; interquartile range, 33-94). Most AVMs were small (74.1% <3 cm in diameter); 48.1% were located in an eloquent area, 27.8% had deep drainage, and 39.8% presented with hemorrhage. RESULTS: The annual hemorrhage rate for any undiagnosed AVM was 1.2%, and 3.3% for AVMs with hemorrhagic presentation. Older patients, cortical or subcortical AVMs, and cases with multiple draining veins were less likely to present with bleeding. During the first 36 months postradiosurgery, hemorrhagic AVMs had a rebleeding rate of 2.1%, and a rate of 1.1% from 3 years onwards. Nonhemorrhagic AVMs had a hemorrhage rate of 1.4% during the first 3 years and 0.3% afterward. Arterial hypertension and nidus volume were independent predictors of bleeding after treatment. Mean nidus obliteration time was 37 ± 18 months (median, 32; interquartile range, 25-40), with hemorrhage rate of 1.3% before and 0.6% after obliteration, and 1.9% for AVMs that were not closed at the end of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Both hemorrhagic and nonhemorrhagic AVMs benefit from radiosurgical therapy, with gradual decrease in their bleeding rates over the years. Albeit small, the risk of hemorrhage persists during the entirety of follow-up, being higher for cases with hemorrhagic presentation and nonobliterated AVM.",2012 May,2012,Stroke,43,5,1247-52,eng,False,10.1161/STROKEAHA.111.635789;STROKEAHA.111.635789;10.1161/STROKEAHA.111.635789,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Arteriovenous Fistula/diagnosis/*surgery;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/*surgery;Intracranial Hemorrhages/*epidemiology/mortality/prevention & control;Kaplan-Meier Estimate;Male;Middle Aged;Postoperative Complications/*epidemiology/mortality/prevention & control;Prevalence;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Risk Factors;Time Factors;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",
25280569,Multimodal angiographic assessment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations: a pilot study.,"PURPOSE: We describe our protocol of three-dimensional (3D) Roadmap intracranial navigation and image fusion for analysis of the angioarchitecture and endovascular treatment of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). METHODS: We performed superselective catheterization of brain AVMs feeders under 3D-Roadmap navigation. Angiograms of each catheterized artery on two registered orthogonal views were transferred to the imaging workstations, and dedicated postprocessing imaging software allowed automated multiple overlays of the arterial supply of the AVM superselective acquisitions on the global angiogram in angiographic or 3D views and on coregistered MRI datasets. RESULTS: 11 untreated brain AVMs (4 with hemorrhagic presentation) were explored. The superselective acquisitions were performed under 3D-Roadmap navigation in 74 arteries, for a total of 79 targeted arteries. Imaging analysis was available at table side or postoperatively for discussion of the therapeutic strategy. No complications occurred during superselective catheterization. The accuracy of the coregistration of angiogram and MRI was submillimetric after automated mutual information coregistration, with manual re-registration by the physicians. CONCLUSIONS: Superselective angiograms acquired under 3D-Roadmap navigation can be postprocessed with multiple overlays. The fluoroscopic navigation under 3D-Roadmapping and the coregistration of 3D rotational angiography, selective angiography, and 3D MR datasets appears reliable with millimeter accuracy, and could be implemented in the critical brain AVM embolization setting to allow refined analysis of AVM angioarchitecture.",2015 Nov,2015,Journal of neurointerventional surgery,7,11,841-7,eng,False,10.1136/neurintsurg-2014-011402;neurintsurg-2014-011402;10.1136/neurintsurg-2014-011402,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Angiography, Digital Subtraction/methods;Cerebral Angiography/*methods;Child;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional/*methods;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging;Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods;Male;Middle Aged;Multimodal Imaging;Neuronavigation/*methods;Pilot Projects;Preoperative Care;Young Adult",Angiography;Arteriovenous Malformation;Vascular Malformation
25938563,Posterior fossa arteriovenous malformations: Significance of higher incidence of bleeding and hydrocephalus.,"OBJECTIVE: Hydrocephalus associated with different types of intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) has been scarcely studied. In the present report we investigate this association with posterior fossa AVMs (pfAVMs). We hypothesized that there is an increased risk of hydrocephalus and required permanent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt in patients with pfAVMs that may be linked to the increased risk of bleeding of these lesions. We also review the factors associated with this increased risk of hemorrhagic presentation and we assess how it affects management strategies and functional outcomes in these patients. METHODS: Out of a prospective registry of 374 patients with brain AVMs diagnosed in our center from 1993 to 2013, 60 (16%) had a pfAVM. We described these patients' demographics, their AVM characteristics, clinical presentation, and hydrocephalus incidence and compared the results with those of the supratentorial AVM (spAVM) patients recorded during the same period. RESULTS: Out of the 60 patients with pfAVMs, 10 (16.7%) presented AVMs located in the brainstem. Hemorrhagic presentation (49/60; 82%) was significantly higher in pfAVMs than in spAVMs (122/314; 38.8%; p<0.05). Hydrocephalus was a common complication in pfAVM patients who had a statistically significant higher need for both temporary external ventricular drain (EVD) (6.7 vs. 20%; p<0.05) and permanent CSF shunts (3.5 vs. 20%; p<0.05). The initial mortality was high (12/60; 20.3%) and half of these patients died before any treatment option could be offered. However, out of those who survived, 70% (42/60) had already shown good clinical outcome at the 6-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Hemorrhagic presentation and hydrocephalus have a higher incidence in pfAVM patients, which initially results in more neurological deficits and an elevated mortality even before receiving any treatment. However, a large number of survivors present good functional outcomes at early follow-up, justifying an aggressive management strategy with microsurgery as the first treatment option in most cases, and radiosurgery as an alternative, especially in brainstem AVMs.",2015 Jul,2015,Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,134,,37-43,eng,False,S0303-8467(15)00125-0;10.1016/j.clineuro.2015.04.003;S0303-8467(15)00125-0;10.1016/j.clineuro.2015.04.003,Clinical Study;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Brain Stem/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Cerebellum/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Cerebrospinal Fluid Shunts;Child;Child, Preschool;Embolization, Therapeutic;Female;Humans;Hydrocephalus/*etiology;Infant;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/diagnostic;Intracranial Hemorrhages/diagnostic imaging/etiology/*surgery;Male;Microsurgery;Middle Aged;Prognosis;Prospective Studies;Radiosurgery;*Registries;Rupture, Spontaneous;Subarachnoid Hemorrhage/diagnostic imaging/etiology/*surgery;Tomography, X-Ray Computed;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",Associated aneurysms;Hemorrhagic presentation;Hydrocephalus;Posterior fossa AVM;Shunt
25001989,Embolization-induced angiogenesis in cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"Endovascular occlusion of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM) is often utilized as adjunctive therapy in combination with radiosurgery or microsurgery. Evidence supports that partial occlusion of AVM via endovascular embolization leads to increased angiogenesis. This phenomenon may be a contributing factor to the decreased efficacy of AVM radiosurgery following embolization. We review the literature for potential mechanisms of embolization-induced angiogenesis. A comprehensive literature search was performed using PubMed to identify studies that sought to elucidate the pathophysiology behind embolization-induced angiogenesis. The terms ""arteriovenous malformation"", ""embolization"", and ""angiogenesis"" were used to search for relevant publications individually and together. Three distinct mechanisms for embolization-induced angiogenesis were described in the literature: (1) hypoxia-mediated angiogenesis, (2) inflammatory-mediated angiogenesis, and (3) hemodynamic-mediated angiogenesis. Embolization-induced angiogenesis of cerebral AVM likely results from a combination of the three aforementioned mechanisms. However, future research is necessary to determine the relative contribution of each individual mechanism to overall post-embolization AVM neovascularization.",2014 Nov,2014,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society,21,11,1866-71,eng,False,S0967-5868(14)00259-8;10.1016/j.jocn.2014.04.010;S0967-5868(14)00259-8;10.1016/j.jocn.2014.04.010,Journal Article;Review,"Antigens, CD/physiology;Cell Hypoxia;Cerebrovascular Circulation;Combined Modality Therapy;Dimethyl Sulfoxide/radiation effects/therapeutic use;Embolization, Therapeutic/*adverse effects;Endoglin;Forecasting;Gene Expression Regulation;Hemodynamics;Humans;Inflammation;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/surgery/*therapy;Models, Cardiovascular;Neovascularization, Pathologic/*etiology/physiopathology/prevention & control;Polyvinyls/radiation effects/therapeutic use;Radiosurgery;Receptors, Cell Surface/physiology;Stroke/etiology/prevention & control;Treatment Outcome;Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/antagonists &;Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/physiology",Angiogenesis;Arteriovenous malformation;Embolization;Hypoxia;Inflammation;Stroke
25037466,Augmented reality in the surgery of cerebral arteriovenous malformations: technique assessment and considerations.,"BACKGROUND: Augmented reality technology has been used for intraoperative image guidance through the overlay of virtual images, from preoperative imaging studies, onto the real-world surgical field. Although setups based on augmented reality have been used for various neurosurgical pathologies, very few cases have been reported for the surgery of arteriovenous malformations (AVM). We present our experience with AVM surgery using a system designed for image injection of virtual images into the operating microscope's eyepiece, and discuss why augmented reality may be less appealing in this form of surgery. METHODS: N = 5 patients underwent AVM resection assisted by augmented reality. Virtual three-dimensional models of patients' heads, skulls, AVM nidi, and feeder and drainage vessels were selectively segmented and injected into the microscope's eyepiece for intraoperative image guidance, and their usefulness was assessed in each case. RESULTS: Although the setup helped in performing tailored craniotomies, in guiding dissection and in localizing drainage veins, it did not provide the surgeon with useful information concerning feeder arteries, due to the complexity of AVM angioarchitecture. CONCLUSION: The difficulty in intraoperatively conveying useful information on feeder vessels may make augmented reality a less engaging tool in this form of surgery, and might explain its underrepresentation in the literature. Integrating an AVM's hemodynamic characteristics into the augmented rendering could make it more suited to AVM surgery.",2014 Sep,2014,Acta neurochirurgica,156,9,1769-74,eng,False,10.1007/s00701-014-2183-9;10.1007/s00701-014-2183-9,Evaluation Study;Journal Article,"Adult;Angiography, Digital Subtraction/*instrumentation;Cerebral Angiography/*instrumentation;Craniotomy/instrumentation;Female;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional/*instrumentation;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnosis/*surgery;Male;Microsurgery/*instrumentation;Middle Aged;Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures/instrumentation;Neuronavigation/*instrumentation;*User-Computer Interface;Young Adult",
37995674,Hemorrhagic Outcome of Brainstem Cavernous Malformations following Radiosurgery: Dose-Response Relationship.,"INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to assess the impact of gamma knife radiosurgery on brainstem cavernous malformations (CMs). METHODS: A total of 85 patients (35 females; median age 41.0 years) who underwent gamma knife radiosurgery for brainstem CMs at our institute between 2006 and 2015 were enrolled in a prospective clinical observation trial. Risk factors for hemorrhagic outcomes were evaluated, and outcomes were compared across different margin doses. RESULTS: The pre-radiosurgery annual hemorrhage rate (AHR) was 32.3% (44 hemorrhages during 136.2 patient-years). The median planning target volume was 1.292 cc. The median margin and maximum doses were 15.0 and 29.2 Gy, respectively, with a median isodose line of 50.0%. The post-radiosurgery AHR was 2.7% (21 hemorrhages during 769.9 patient-years), with a rate of 5.5% within the first 2 years and 2.0% thereafter. The post-radiosurgery AHR for patients with margin doses of ≤13.0 Gy (n = 15), 14.0-15.0 Gy (n = 50), and ≥16.0 Gy (n = 20) was 5.4, 2.7, and 0.6%, respectively. Correspondingly, transient adverse radiation effects were observed in 6.7 (1/15), 10.0 (5/50), and 30.0% (6/20) of cases, respectively. An increased margin dose per 1 Gy (hazard ratio: 0.530, 95% CI: 0.341-0.826, p = 0.005) was identified as an independent protective factor against post-radiosurgery hemorrhage. Margin doses of ≥16.0 Gy were associated with improved hemorrhagic outcomes (hazard ratio: 0.343, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.157-0.749, p = 0.007), but an increased risk of adverse radiation effects (odds ratio: 3.006, 95% CI: 1.041-8.677, p = 0.042). CONCLUSION: The AHR of brainstem CMs decreased following radiosurgery, and our study revealed a significant dose-response relationship. Margin doses of 14-15 Gy were recommended.

26993142,Clinical experience with navigated 3D ultrasound angiography (power Doppler) in microsurgical treatment of brain arteriovenous malformations.,"INTRODUCTION: We have previously described a method that has the potential to improve surgery of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). In the present paper, we present our clinical results. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of 78 patients referred for AVMs to our University Hospital from our geographical catchment region from 2005 through 2013, 31 patients were operated on with microsurgical technique. 3D MR angiography (MRA) with neuronavigation was used for planning. Navigated 3D ultrasound angiography (USA) was used to identify and clip feeders in the initial phase of the operation. None of our patients was embolized preoperatively as part of the surgical procedure. The niduses were extirpated based on the 3D USA. After extirpation, controls were done with 3D USA to verify that the AVMs were completely removed. The Spetzler three-tier classification of the patients was: A: 21, B: 6, C: 4. RESULTS: Sixty-eight feeders were identified on preoperative MRA and DSA and 67 feeders were identified and clipped by guidance of intraoperative 3D USA. Six feeders identified preoperatively were missed by 3D USA, while five preoperatively unknown feeders were found and clipped. The overall average bleeding was 440 ml. There was a significant reduction in average bleeding in the last 15 operations compared to the first 16 (340 vs. 559 ml, p = 0.019). We had no serious morbidity (GOS 3 or less). New deficits due to surgery were two patients with quadrantanopia (one class B and one class C), the latter (C) also acquired epilepsy. One patient (class A) acquired a hardly noticeable paresis in two fingers. One hundred percent angiographic cure was achieved in all patients, as evaluated by postoperative DSA. CONCLUSIONS: Navigated intraoperative 3D USA is a useful tool to identify and clip AVM feeders. Microsurgical extirpation assisted by navigated 3D USA is an effective and safe method for removing AVMs.",2016 May,2016,Acta neurochirurgica,158,5,875-83,eng,False,10.1007/s00701-016-2750-3;10.1007/s00701-016-2750-3;2750;10.1007/s00701-016-2750-3,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Brain/*surgery;Cerebral Angiography/*methods;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Angiography/*methods;Microsurgery/*methods;Neuronavigation/*methods,AVM;Clipping of feeders;Microsurgery;Navigated 3D US angiography
26260759,Endovascular treatment of cerebellar arteriovenous malformations: management of associated aneurysms first or later.,"The purpose of this study was to determine the safety and effectiveness of cerebellar arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) embolization and find out the suitable methods to manage associated aneurysms. Medical records of all patients between 1997 and 2014 with a diagnosis of cerebellar AVMs were retrospectively reviewed. Univariable and multivariable logistic analysis were used to assess AVMs characteristics to calculate for the risk of hemorrhage. Endovascular treatment was the main treatment measure to manage the AVMs and associated aneurysms. Of 142 patients, 115 (81.0 %) presented with hemorrhage and 42 (29.6 %) with associated aneurysms. A significant association with cerebellar AVMs hemorrhage was found for small size, prenidal aneurysms, and deep venous drainage in the univariable and multivariable analysis. Associated aneurysms were treated firstly in 41 patients except for 1 patient with 2 prenidal and 2 intranidal aneurysms. The special case was dealt with AVMs and 2 intranidal aneurysms first and angiography showed that the 2 prenidal associated aneurysms disappeared with time. Hemorrhage appeared in 13/142 patients (9.2 %) during the follow-up period, none of which was with associated aneurysms. Endovascular treatment can be a feasible way for treating cerebellar AVMs. Intranidal associated aneurysms should be treated first.

Postoperatively, the patient developed robust rigidity and akinesia with mutism, suggesting secondary parkinsonism. These symptoms showed marked improvement after administration of levodopa, and were not aggravated after discontinuation. The pathophysiology of this case might involve dysfunction of the dopaminergic system caused by repeated compression and release of the paraventricular white matter.

Noninvasive preoperative studies for identification of CS are also needed for choosing the optimal operative procedure. Magneto-encephalography (MEG) has recently been introduced for non-invasive preoperative investigation and cortical functional mapping. METHODS: Stereotactic mapping of functional CS anatomy was performed preoperatively on 13 subjects using somatosensory evoked fields with MRI-linked whole head MEG system. All subjects had a left sided peri-motor cortex lesion with diagnoses including the following conditions: three arteriovenous malformations (AVM), seven gliomas, three meningiomas. FINDINGS: Functional CS in supratentorial brain tumor and parietal AVM cases corresponded with anatomical CS identified by MRI. But the AVM cases in whom the nidus was situated within the peri-motor cortex showed discrepancies between anatomical CS and functional CS.

25034506,Transdural indocyanine green video-angiography of vascular malformations.,"BACKGROUND: The role of indocyanine green video-angiography (ICG-VA) in the surgical resection of vascular malformations has been largely described; conversely, the utility of ICG-VA before dural opening (transdural ICG-VA) in this situation remains unclear. The aim of this study is to present the application of transdural ICG-VA in a consecutive series of patients in order to explore the potential provided by a transdural visualisation of vascular malformations. METHOD: We retrospectively analysed the application of intra-operative ICG-VA before dural opening in 15 consecutive patients who underwent surgical resection of vascular malformations. The cases included 12 cerebral arterio-venous malformations (AVMs), 2 cerebral dural arterio-venous fistulas (dAVFs) and 1 spinal arterio-venous fistula (AVF). RESULTS: ICG-VA before dural opening allowed the visualisation of the site and extension of the malformation in 13 out of 15 cases, whilst arterial feeders and venous drainages were identified in 9 out of 15 cases. In two patients with dAVF, the point of fistula could be transdurally identified through ICG-VA. In 14% of cases, the size of bone flap designed on neuronavigation data was then modified according to transdural ICG-VA findings. CONCLUSIONS: Transdural ICG-VA proved an efficient tool that allows optimising the exposure of the malformation, performing a safe dural opening and identifying dural vascular connections of the lesion.",2014 Sep,2014,Acta neurochirurgica,156,9,1761-7,eng,False,10.1007/s00701-014-2164-z;10.1007/s00701-014-2164-z,Journal Article,Adult;Aged;Central Nervous System Vascular Malformations/*diagnosis/*surgery;*Cerebral Angiography;Female;Humans;*Indocyanine Green;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Neuronavigation;*Optical Imaging;Retrospective Studies;Spinal Cord/blood supply;Vascular Surgical Procedures;*Video Recording,
20433275,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for deep-seated cavernous malformations: a move toward more active, early intervention. Clinical article.","OBJECT: The role of radiosurgery in the treatment of cavernous malformations (CMs) remains controversial. It is frequently recommended only for inoperable lesions that have bled at least twice. Rehemorrhage can carry a substantial risk of morbidity, however. The authors reviewed their practice of treating deep-seated inoperable CMs to assess the complication rate of radiosurgery, the impact that radiosurgery might have on rebleeding, and whether a more active, earlier intervention is justified in managing this condition. METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective analysis of 113 patients with 79 brainstem and 39 thalamic/basal ganglia CMs treated with Gamma Knife surgery. Lesions were stratified into 2 groups: those that might be lower risk with no more than 1 symptomatic bleed before radiosurgical treatment and those deemed high risk with multiple symptomatic hemorrhages before treatment. RESULTS: Forty-one CMs had multiple symptomatic hemorrhages before radiosurgery with a first-ever bleed rate of 2.9% per lesion per year, a rebleed rate of 30.5% per lesion per year, and a median time of 1.5 years between the first and second bleeds. In this group the rebleed rate decreased to 15% for the first 2 years after radiosurgery and declined further to 2.4% thereafter. Pretreatment multiple bleeds led to persistent deficits in 72% of the patients. Seventy-seven CMs had no more than 1 symptomatic bleed before radiosurgery, making for a lifetime bleed rate of 2.2% per lesion per year. The short period between the presenting bleed and treatment (median 1 year) makes the natural history in this group uncertain. The rate of hemorrhage in the first 2 years after treatment was 5.1%, and 1.3% thereafter. Pretreatment hemorrhages resulted in permanent deficits in 43% of the patients in this group, a rate significantly lower than in the multiple-bleeds group (p < 0.001). Posttreatment hemorrhages led to persistent deficits in only 7.3% of the patients. Permanent adverse radiation effects were rare (7.3%) and minor in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic radiosurgery is a safe management strategy for CMs in eloquent sites with the marked advantage of reducing rebleed risks in patients with repeated pretreatment hemorrhages. The benefit in treating CMs with a single bleed is less clear. Note, however, that repeated hemorrhage carries a significant risk of increased morbidity far in excess of any radiosurgery-related morbidity, and the authors assert that this finding justifies the early active management of deep-seated CMs.",2010 Oct,2010,Journal of neurosurgery,113,4,691-9,eng,False,10.3171/2010.3.JNS091156;10.3171/2010.3.JNS091156,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Basal Ganglia Diseases/surgery;Brain Neoplasms/mortality/*surgery;Brain Stem Neoplasms/surgery;Child;Child, Preschool;Follow-Up Studies;Hemangioma, Cavernous, Central Nervous System/mortality/*surgery;Humans;Infant;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/mortality/*surgery;Intracranial Hemorrhages/epidemiology;Male;Middle Aged;*Neurosurgical Procedures/mortality;Patient Selection;Postoperative Complications/epidemiology/mortality;*Radiosurgery/mortality;Risk Assessment;Thalamic Diseases/surgery;Young Adult",
17876588,Management of intracranial cavernous malformation in pediatric patients.,"OBJECTIVE: Cavernous malformations (CMs) are vascular malformations affecting any part of the central nervous system. CMs in the pediatric age group are known to be different from those of adults both in origin and clinical characteristics. In this paper, we report our experience in managing CMs in pediatric patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 1994 and December 2006, 33 patients younger than 20 years of age with intracranial CMs were treated with microsurgery or radiosurgery. We retrospectively reviewed the presentation and treatment of these 33 patients (18 boys and 15 girls; average age 11.6 years). RESULTS: The most common symptom at presentation was seizure (19 children, 57.6%). The most common type of CM, classified on the basis of magnetic resonance imaging, was type II (18, 54.5%). The supratentorial compartment was the most frequent location (27, 71.8%), and only six CMs (18.2%) were observed in the infratentorial compartment. Microsurgery was performed on 25 patients (75.8%), and radiosurgery was performed on eight patients (24.2%). The overall post-treatment results were positive. Only two children (6.1%) had persistent presurgical neurological signs, although the treatment ameliorated them. No progression of the preoperative neurological signs or onset of new neurological deficits was seen in any of the patients. In our patient group, the microsurgical removal of CMs resulted in the prevention of recurrent hemorrhage and the control of seizure disorders in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that pediatric patients with symptomatic CMs should be treated surgically because of the risk of recurrent hemorrhaging and the general benefits of CM removal.",2008 Mar,2008,Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for,24,3,321-7,eng,False,10.1007/s00381-007-0465-8,Comparative Study;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Age Factors;Brain Neoplasms/complications/pathology/*surgery;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Hemangioma, Cavernous, Central Nervous System/complications/pathology/*surgery;Humans;Infant;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/pathology/*surgery;Intracranial Hemorrhages/etiology/prevention & control;Male;*Microsurgery;*Radiosurgery;Treatment Outcome",

The diffuse nidus of the AVM, 25 mm in size, was located in the posterior superior temporal gyrus, with drainage into the sylvian veins (Spetzler-Martin Grade II). The AVM was located stereotactically, and resection was performed through a small corticectomy. The clot cavity was evacuated. Feeding branches to the AVM were identified during careful dissection, and parent M1 and M2 branches were preserved. The patient recovered well, with no residual speech deficit.

20931239,Clinicopathological study on chronic encapsulated expanding hematoma associated with incompletely obliterated AVM after stereotactic radiosurgery.,"BACKGROUND: Chronic encapsulated expanding hematoma is a rare, but highly morbid, severe complication after stereotactic radiosurgery for intracerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). The aim of this study was to clarify the clinical features and possible mechanisms of formation and expansion of this type of hematoma based on histopathological findings. METHODS: The patients were comprised of three males and one female. Three of these patients had AVMs in the basal ganglia, while the remaining one in the frontal lobe. RESULTS: Cerebral angiograms performed 6 months to 11 years after radiosurgery demonstrated major, but incomplete, obliteration of the nidi. Each patient developed localized enhancing mass lesions at 2, 3, 5, and 11 years after radiosurgery. The lesions expanded slowly, but progressively over time in association with marked perifocal edema. The perifocal edema disappeared immediately after removal of the hematoma; their neurological symptoms improved partially or completely. Histopathologically, the hematomas were well-encapsulated and the capsule walls uniformly consisted of an outer fibrocollagenous layer and an inner granulation layer. Immunohistochemistry revealed vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in the endothelium of newly formed blood vessels and myofibroblasts in the hematoma capsule inner layer. Myofibroblasts also expressed VEGFR-1. CONCLUSIONS: The activation of VEGF pathway may lead to neovascularization in the granulation layer of the hematoma capsule that serves as a continual source of bleeding and perifocal edema. Thus, radical resection of the capsule and residual nidus is strongly recommended for the management of both bleeding and edema.",2011 Apr,2011,Acta neurochirurgica,153,4,883-93,eng,False,10.1007/s00701-010-0829-9;10.1007/s00701-010-0829-9,Journal Article;Review,"Adolescent;Basal Ganglia/blood supply/pathology/surgery;Brain Edema/diagnosis/pathology/surgery;Cerebral Angiography;Chronic Disease;Connective Tissue/pathology;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Frontal Lobe/blood supply/pathology/surgery;Hematoma/*diagnosis/pathology/surgery;Humans;Immunoenzyme Techniques;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/*surgery;Intracranial Hemorrhages/*diagnosis/pathology/surgery;Magnetic Resonance Angiography;Male;Middle Aged;Postoperative Hemorrhage/*diagnosis/pathology/surgery;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects;Reoperation;Tomography, X-Ray Computed;Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism;Young Adult",
20127226,Gene expression signatures in the peripheral blood after radiosurgery of human cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"PURPOSE: To unravel biological mechanisms potentially resulting in the obliteration process after radiosurgery (RS) of human cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) by investigating molecular signatures on the transcriptomic level in peripheral blood of patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Venous blood samples were obtained at definite points of time before and after RS. The samples were tested for radiation-induced changes regarding biological markers (mRNA) using cDNA and oligo-microarray technology. The corresponding expression profiles were correlated with clinical data and obliteration signs in radiologic imaging. RESULTS: The proof of principle that RS outcome can be successfully correlated with transcriptomics of cellular blood components as disease parameter was demonstrated. The authors identified 76 differentially regulated genes (p < 0.001) after RS. Interestingly, in particular genes with known roles in anti-angiogenic and pro-coagulative pathways were identified as potentially relevant. In particularly, the authors found a significant downregulation of neuropilin-2, protein C inhibitor and cyclin-dependent kinase 6. They also found that low pretreatment blood mRNA levels of TLR4 (toll-like receptor 4) and STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) correlated with fast obliteration of AVMs. CONCLUSION: The authors report on a novel technique for molecular biological analysis of blood from patients with cerebral AVM treated with RS. Differential regulation of genes in peripheral blood was successfully correlated with RS and time to obliteration of AVMs. The identified genes indicate a potential new methodology to monitor RS, which may result in an individualized therapy and optimized follow-up.",2010 Feb,2010,Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ...

12748884,"Direct costs of microsurgical management of radiosurgically amenable intracranial pathology in Germany: an analysis of meningiomas, acoustic neuromas, metastases and arteriovenous malformations of less than 3 cm in diameter.","BACKGROUND: The purpose of the analysis was to appreciate and compare the effective direct costs of microsurgical treatment of intracranial pathology potentially amenable to radiosurgery as they arose in 1998-99. METHOD: Treatment costs of 127 microsurgically treated patients harbouring an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), acoustic nEuroma, meningioma or brain metastasis potentially amenable to radiosurgery were reviewed. Costs for the surgical procedure, ICU care, medical and nursing care on the ward, interclinical bills (ICB) for services provided by other departments and the overhead for basic hotel service were added. For comparison Gamma Knife costs were calculated by dividing the global operating cost of the Gamma Knife centre by the number of patients treated in 1999. FINDINGS: Average hospitalisation time for the entire microsurgical patients was 15,4+/-8,6 days. The patients spent an average of 1,2+/-2,8 days on ICU. Average operating time for all patients, including preparation, was 393+/-118 minutes. Average costs for the microsurgical therapy were Euro10.814+/-6.108. These consisted of Euro1417+/-426 for the surgical procedure, Euro1.188+/-2.658 for ICU care, Euro2.333+/-1.582 for medical and nursing care on the ward, Euro1.671+/-1.433 for interclinical bills and Euro 4.204+/-2.338 for basic hotel service (overhead, Euro273/day). 70% of the microsurgically treated patients needed ancillary inpatient rehabilitation or radiotherapy resulting in an average additional cost for all patients of Euro2.744. Furthermore 20% of the microsurgically treated patients required an unplanned readmission after discharge, resulting in an average additional costs for all patients of Euro1.684. Average overall costs per patient including ancillary therapy and unplanned readmissions amounted to Euro15.242. For comparison, Gamma Knife treatment costs per patient amounted to Euro7.920 in 1999. INTERPRETATION: The current analysis showed that for established radiosurgical indications the primary costs of microsurgery exceeded the costs of radiosurgery. Differences with regard to additional expenses as a consequence of disability were not addressed in this study.

17213451,Brain AVM embolization with Onyx.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To report the initial experience by using a new liquid embolic agent (Onyx) for embolization of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). METHODS: Between May 2000 and December 2005, 44 patients with brain AVMs were embolized with Onyx. There were 18 women and 26 men with a mean age of 42.4 years (median 44, range 14-71 years). Clinical presentation included seizures in 26 patients (59%), hemorrhage from the AVM in 13 patients (30%), subarachnoid hemorrhage from a concomitant aneurysm in 3 patients (7%), visual disturbances in 1 patient (2.3%), and in 1 patient (2.3%) the AVM was an incidental finding. Mean estimated size of the AVM was 3.9 cm (median 4, range 2-7 cm). RESULTS: In 44 patients, 52 embolization procedures were performed with 138 feeding pedicles embolized, ranging from 1 to 7 per patient. Average estimated size reduction was 75% (median 80%, range 40%-100%). Total obliteration was achieved in 7 AVMs (16%), and partial embolization was followed by surgery in 10 patients and by radiosurgery in 20 patients. Complications occurred in 6 patients, leading to death in 1 patient (mortality 2.3%) and to permanent disability in 2 patients (morbidity 4.6%). CONCLUSION: Onyx is feasible and safe in the embolization of brain AVMs. Complete obliteration can be achieved in small AVMs. Large AVMs can be adequately reduced in size for additional surgical or radiosurgical treatment.",2007 Jan,2007,AJNR.

15690217,Microsurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformation management: a Siberian experience.,"Cerebral vascular malformations remain among the most difficult neurosurgical entities to treat. We report a retrospective study of the outcome in 95 consecutive patients with angiographically revealed arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Fifty-four patients underwent microsurgical total AVM removal (group I). Forty-one patients who refused open surgery (group II) were managed either by endovascular embolisation (16 cases), radiosurgery (three) or followed up with medical treatment for their symptoms. In the first group pretreatment with the non-selective beta-blocker propranolol before surgery, the current neuronavigation techniques, intraoperative embolisation and AVM nidus colouring in high flow AVM were used for total microsurgical excision of the lesions. All AVM patients but one survived microsurgery. The mortality rate was 1.8% for group I. Six patients with grade IV-V AVM developed new temporal neurological symptoms following surgery. Four of them recovered completely in 3-6 weeks; two patients remained with mild persistent monoparesis and with homonymous hemianopsia postoperatively. In ten of 13 epileptic patients surgery produced a cure. No patient re-bled following surgery. No postoperative normal perfusion pressure breakthrough occurred. In the second group ten patients (24%) developed intracerebral haemorrhages, six of ten patients demonstrated progressive seizures. The mortality rate in group II totalled 17% over 6 years.

29368047,The impact of nTMS mapping on treatment of brain AVMs.,"BACKGROUND: The treatment of brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVMs) is still contrarily discussed. Despite the debatable results of the ARUBA trial, most BAVMs still require treatment depending on the Spetzler-Martin (SM) grading. Since size is measurable and venous drainage is visible, the determination of eloquence is comparably crucial but not fully objective. The present bicentric cohort study aims to examine the influence of preoperative navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) motor and language mapping data on decision-making for or against surgical treatment of BAVMs. METHODS: The influence of data from nTMS on decision-making for or against treatment of BAVMs was examined by confirming/falsifying presumed motor or language eloquence. RESULTS: The results of nTMS mappings changed the SM grading in nine cases. In six cases, the SM grading changed to a lower grade (= falsified eloquence); in three cases, the SM grading changed to a higher grade due to nTMS mappings (= unexpected eloquence). Out of all 34 cases, indication for surgery was supported by nTMS mappings in 15 cases (7 motors, 8 languages). In six cases, the decision against surgery was made based on nTMS mappings (three motors, three languages). CONCLUSION: In 21 of 34 cases (62%), nTMS was a supportive argument. We could show that nTMS motor and language data can be used for a more objective decision-making regarding the treatment of BAVMs and for a more detailed SM grading regarding the rating of eloquence.",2018 Mar,2018,Acta neurochirurgica,160,3,567-578,eng,False,10.1007/s00701-018-3475-2;10.1007/s00701-018-3475-2;10.1007/s00701-018-3475-2,"Case Reports;Journal Article;Multicenter Study;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Algorithms;Brain Mapping/*methods;Child;Clinical Decision-Making/*methods;Cohort Studies;Diffusion Tensor Imaging;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnostic imaging/*therapy;Language;Male;Middle Aged;Movement;Neuronavigation/methods;Neurosurgical Procedures;Postoperative Complications/epidemiology/therapy;Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation/*methods;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult,Brain AVM;Motor and language mapping;Spetzler-Martin grading;nTMS

We demonstrate the use of augmented reality in the localization of arterial feeders and draining veins in relation to bordering normal structures (Video 1). A 66-year-old man presented with several episodes of severe right frontal headaches. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an AVM along the right frontal pole. Subsequent computed tomography angiography demonstrated arterial supply from the right anterior cerebral artery with venous drainage to the superior sagittal sinus. Due to the size, noneloquent location, and superficial pattern of venous drainage, the patient elected to proceed with microsurgery. A virtual planning platform was used in preparation for surgery. Augmented reality integrated with neuronavigation was used during microsurgical resection. Postoperative angiography showed complete resection of the AVM.

While they can be benign lesions, the presence of retrograde venous drainage and cortical venous reflux makes the natural course of these lesions aggressive high risk of haemorrhage, neurological injury and mortality. Endovascular treatment is often the first line of treatment for dAVF. Both transarterial and transvenous approaches are used to cure dAVF. The selection of treatment approach depends on the angioarchitecture of the dAVF, the location, the direction of venous flow.

17630936,Prevention of intracerebral haemorrhage.,"Nontraumatic intracerebral haemorrhages arise from a wide range of causes falling into two broad groups: discreet vascular ""ictohaemorrhagic"" lesions such as aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations, cavernomas, tumours, and dural fistulae; and more generalised amyloid or hypertension related conditions. It is now possible using family history, associated risk factors and gradient echo MRI to predict cases at high risk of hypertensive or amyloid related haemorrhage. There is considerable potential for prevention of hypertensive haemorrhages by treatment of high risk cases with antihypertensive medication. As yet no effective preventative treatment for amyloid angiopathy related ICH has emerged although a variety of drugs are under investigation. Prevention of haemorrhage from ictohaemorrhagic lesions revolves around removal or obliteration of the lesion.

19482418,High-grade dural arteriovenous fistula simulating a bilateral thalamic neoplasm.,"Dural arteriovenous fistulae (dAVF) provide a diagnostic challenge and must be part of a broad differential in pursuit of a difficult diagnosis or unusual presentation. This case report demonstrates an initially misguided diagnosis of bilateral thalamic neoplasm and demonstrates the importance of continued pursuit until the correct diagnosis is obtained. Moreover, to our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a dAVF simulating a bilateral thalamic neoplasm. We present a patient with a provisional diagnosis of bilateral thalamic neoplasm based on clinical history and an advanced imaging workup including MR spectroscopy. Subsequent biopsy suggested venous congestion, hypoxia, and edema without neoplasia.

Vascular contractility studies of the rat middle cerebral artery after chronic survival.,"In vitro isometric small vessel myograph experiments and pathological investigations were performed on rat middle cerebral arteries. Thirty-four animals provided 68 normal vessels, six further rats had the endothelial layer mechanically removed from their 12 arteries. Eighteen animals received gamma knife irradiation to the middle cerebral arteries. Fifteen of these received 50 Gray, and three 25 Gray dose to the 50% isodose and the contralateral vessels offered 20 Gray and 15 Gray irradiated specimens. Survival times varied from 12 weeks to 18 months. In the acute stage, abolition of potassium-induced relaxation occurred as early as 24 h after irradiation whilst in one year this reaction seemed to recover and remained active to 18 months. The contraction response to prostaglandin F2 alpha was diminished at six weeks in the 50 Gray-irradiated vessels. However, from one year further reduction was seen and by 18 months this response was totally abolished. We demonstrated reduction of contractile capability of the irradiated normal vessels while the vessels remained patent. When using low irradiation dose there were no pathological changes even at 18 months, but marked physiological changes could be demonstrated.

Instead of intra-venous injection of ICG, we describe a case of intraoperative video angiography with intra-arterial injection of ICG in cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) surgery. During the surgery, we injected ICG through a catheter placed in the internal carotid artery in each step. The technique was feasible and useful to distinguish feeders from normal arteries and to observe changes in flow dynamics. Intra-arterial injection of ICG had better phase contrast than intra-venous injection of ICG and better spatial resolution than digital subtraction angiography.

25749839,Glioblastoma after AVM radiosurgery. Case report and review of the literature.,"BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is considered to be a relatively safe procedure in cerebral arteriovenous malformation management. There are very few reported cases of SRS-associated/induced malignancies. METHODS: We show the case of a 21-year-old female who presented with a 21-mm(3) ruptured AVM in the right mesial frontocallosal region. Embolization and/or radiosurgery was proposed. She preferred radiosurgery. The AVM was treated with CyberKnife(®) SRS. RESULTS: She presented behavior changes 6 years after SRS. MRI showed a right subcortical frontal lesion with increased perfusion, more consistent with high-grade glioma. The lesion's center was within the irradiated region of the previous SRS, having received an estimated radiation dose of 4 Gy. Pathological examination noted a hypercellular tumor showing astrocytic tumor cells with moderate pleomorphism in a fibrillary background, endothelial proliferation, and tumor necrosis surrounded by perinecrotic pseudopalisades. Numerous mitotic figures were seen. The appearances were those of glioblastoma, WHO grade IV, with neuronal differentiation. SRS-associated/-induced GBM after treatment of a large AM is exceptional. SRS-associated/-induced malignancies are mostly GBMs and occur on average after a latency of 9.4 years, within very low-dose peripheral regions as well as the full-dose regions; 33.3 % of patients were under 20 years at the time of SRS, and in 66 % the lesion treated was a vascular pathology. CONCLUSION: Although it is unlikely that the risk of radiation-induced cancer will change the current standard of practice, patients must be warned of this potential possibility before treatment.",2015 May,2015,Acta neurochirurgica,157,5,889-95,eng,False,10.1007/s00701-015-2377-9;10.1007/s00701-015-2377-9,Case Reports;Journal Article;Review,"Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Glioblastoma/*etiology;Humans;Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",
25480885,Cone-beam CT angiography (Dyna CT) for intraoperative localization of cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"BACKGROUND: Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the brain are commonly treated in multimodality fashion, with endovascular embolization followed by surgical extirpation being one of the most effective strategies. Modern endovascular suites enable rotational angiography, also known as cone-beam CT angiography (CBCT-A), using the full capability of modern C-arm digital angiography systems. This imaging modality offers a superior image quality to current options such as digital subtraction angiography, MRI, or CT angiography. Preoperative planning can be greatly aided by the resolution of angioarchitecture seen in CBCT-A images. Furthermore, these images can be used for intraoperative neuronavigation when integrated with widely used frameless stereotactic systems. The utility and outcome of the use of CBCT-A for preoperative planning and intraoperative localization of AVMs was evaluated. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of 16 patients in which CBCT-A was performed, including radiological review and all clinical data. RESULTS: CBCT-A was successfully employed in all cases including those with (n=9) and without (n=7) rupture. Complete resection confirmed by postoperative angiography was achieved in all cases.

12654454,Quantifying the degree of conformity in radiosurgery treatment planning.,"PURPOSE: To compare different parameters used to quantify the quality of a treatment plan and to evaluate the dose conformity and coverage clinically achieved using gamma knife radiosurgery. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Various existing parameters for coverage and conformity are reviewed. Additionally, a modified conformity index (CI) has been defined as the ratio of the volume within the target irradiated to at least the prescription isodose over the total volume enclosed by the prescription isodose. These parameters are calculated for all the 551 evaluable patient treatment plans. RESULTS: The median CI for all targets is 0.75, with a median target coverage of 94.6%. Regardless of the conformity parameter chosen, the conformity is seen to vary depending on the type of tumor and its location, reflecting the treatment planning philosophy. For tumors with volumes smaller than about 1 cm(3), the conformity parameter is also seen to be dependent on the target volume. CONCLUSION: With gamma knife radiosurgery, it is possible to achieve highly conformal dose distributions. A single parameter for the quantification of a plan, though desirable, is not realistic, because of the competing components of high dose to the target and low dose to normal tissue. Thus, we propose the use of the CI, together with the target volume coverage.",2003 Apr 1,2003,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",55,5,1409-19,eng,False,S0360301602045996;10.1016/s0360-3016(02)04599-6,Comparative Study;Journal Article,"Adenoma/surgery;Brain Neoplasms/secondary/surgery;Cobalt Radioisotopes/therapeutic use;Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery;Meningeal Neoplasms/surgery;Meningioma/surgery;Neuroma, Acoustic/surgery;Pituitary Neoplasms/surgery;Radiometry;*Radiosurgery;*Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted;Radiotherapy, Conformal",

15987539,Long-term results after fractionated radiation therapy for large brain arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVE: To study the results after fractionated radiotherapy of large arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). METHODS: Twenty-eight patients harboring large AVMs were treated between 1980 and 1985 with fractionated radiotherapy with up to 3.5 Gy per fraction twice a week to a total dose of 41 to 50 Gy. All but 5 patients were examined with an angiogram at least 4 years after the treatment. RESULTS: Two AVMs (8%) were obliterated after the treatment. Eight patients died: five as a result of hemorrhages, two of unknown causes, and one as a result of lung carcinoma. Five patients deteriorated slightly, three moderately, and four severely after the treatment. The longer the observation time, the higher the incidence of neurological deterioration. The AVMs were significantly larger in the four patients who developed a severe deficit after the treatment. The annual hemorrhage rate was 6% after the treatment, suggesting that radiation did not protect from hemorrhage unless the AVM was occluded. AVMs with a pretreatment rupture had a annual hemorrhage rate of 12%, compared with 1% in the unruptured cases. CONCLUSION: The obliteration rate after fractionated radiotherapy with a dose per fraction of 2 to 4 Gy to a total dose of up to 50 Gy was low. The clinical outcome suggests that the radiation treatment may have caused significant side effects. Although the risk for hemorrhage in previously ruptured large AVMs is high, the use of fractionated radiotherapy using low doses per fraction cannot be recommended.",2005 Jul,2005,Neurosurgery,57,1,42-9; discussion 42-9,eng,False,10.1227/01.neu.0000163095.56638.26,Clinical Trial;Comparative Study;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/*surgery;Brain Diseases/diagnosis/*surgery;Humans;Longitudinal Studies;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/*methods;Radiotherapy Dosage;Retrospective Studies;Statistics, Nonparametric;*Treatment Outcome",
38231447,Stereotactic radiosurgery for brain arteriovenous malformations in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.,"OBJECTIVE: Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) present different characteristics from sporadic AVMs, and they have lower initial bleeding rates. Conservative management is usually preferred for the treatment of these lesions. In this case study, we present the largest series of HHT patients treated with stereotactic radiosurgery to date. METHODS: We identified eight patients with HHT and 14 AVMs. We retrospectively collected clinical, radiographic, and treatment characteristics of the patients and each AVM. RESULTS: Most patients in our sample presented with small AVMs. The median volume of these AVMs was 0.22 cm(3) (IQR 0.08-0.59). Three out of eight patients presented with initial intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The majority of lesions had low (12/14) Spetzler-Martin grades (I-II). Median maximum and margin doses used for treatment were 36.2 (IQR 35.25-44.4) and 20 (IQR 18-22.5) Gy, respectively. The overall obliteration rate after SRS was 11/14, and the median time to obliteration across all 11 obliterated AVMs was 35.83 months (IQR, 17-39.99). Neurological status was favorable with all patients having a mRS of 0 or 1 at the last follow-up. Symptomatic radiation-induced changes (RIC) after SRS were low (7.1%), and there were no permanent RIC. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with HHT who present with multiple brain AVMs are generally well served by SRS. Obliteration can be achieved in the majority of HHT patients and with a low complication rate. In the current study, initial hemorrhage rates prior to SRS were noticeable which supports the decision to treat these AVMs. Future studies are needed to better address the role of SRS for HHT patients harboring ruptured and unruptured AVMs.",2024 Jan 17,2024,Acta neurochirurgica,166,1,21,eng,False,10.1007/s00701-024-05923-4;21;10.1007/s00701-024-05923-4;5923;10.1007/s00701-024-05923-4,Journal Article,"Humans;*Telangiectasia, Hereditary Hemorrhagic/complications/surgery;*Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;*Arteriovenous Malformations;Brain",Hereditary hemorrhagic;Intracranial arteriovenous malformation;Intracranial hemorrhages;Radiosurgery;Telangiectasia

Microsurgical resection has been recommended as the optimal treatment for AVMs in general, but there is no dedicated literature on the outcomes of resection of pediatric rolandic AVMs. Here, the study objective was to review the outcomes of microsurgical resection of pediatric rolandic AVMs in the modern era, together with the utilization of surgical adjuncts including navigation, intraoperative angiography, and neurophysiological monitoring. METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective review of patients 18 years of age and younger with cerebral AVMs microsurgically treated between January 2000 and May 2016 at The Hospital for Sick Children. Only those patients with an AVM whose nidus was located within the rolandic region were analyzed. A descriptive analysis was performed to identify patient demographics, preoperative AVM characteristics, and postoperative obliteration rates and neurological complications. RESULTS: A total of 279 AVMs were evaluated in the study period. Twenty-three of these AVMs were rolandic, and the median age in the 11 microsurgically treated cases was 11 years (range 1-17 years). AVM hemorrhage was the most common presentation, occurring in 8 patients (73%). Lesions were either Spetzler-Martin grade II (n = 8, 73%) or grade III (n = 3, 27%). The postoperative obliteration rate of AVMs was 100%. The mean imaging follow-up duration was 33 months (range 5-164 months). There was no documented recurrence of an AVM during follow-up. One patient developed a transient postoperative hemiparesis, while another patient developed right fingertip hyperesthesia. CONCLUSIONS: Microsurgical resection of rolandic pediatric AVMs yields excellent AVM obliteration with minimal neurological morbidity in selected patients.

30888012,Neurophysiological Monitoring During Arteriovenous Malformation Embolization.,"BACKGROUND: Neurophysiological monitoring (NPM) is frequently performed during arteriovenous malformation (AVM) embolization. However, the ability of NPM to predict neurological deficits or improve surgical decision making in this setting has not been studied. OBJECTIVE: To review our use of NPM during AVM embolization to better define its utility. METHODS: We retrospectively examined AVM embolization cases from 2004 to 2017. We recorded patient and AVM characteristics as well as outcomes. We then reviewed NPM results from each case, including somatosensory evoked potentials and electroencephalogram. Our primary outcome was postoperative neurological deficit, and secondary outcomes were discharge and 30-d modified Rankin Score (mRS). RESULTS: There were 173 embolizations in 74 patients. Mean patient age was 40 yr. There were 8 (5%) transient and 2 (1.3%) permanent neurological complications. Among those with neurological complications, 3 had NPM changes during the operation (positive predictive value [PPV] = 50%). This improved to 67% for permanent NPM change. Three patients had NPM changes but did not suffer clinical deficits postoperatively (negative predictive value = 90%). The predictive value of the test was improved for discharge but not 30-d mRS, and the test performance improved dramatically with increased pretest probabilities (likelihood ratio [LR](+) = 14.5, LR(-) = 0.715). CONCLUSION: We present a large series of AVM embolization operations performed with NPM. The PPV of NPM changes was moderate but improved dramatically with increased pretest probabilities. The rate of permanent neurological complications was among the lowest reported in the literature, suggesting NPM may lead to improved intraoperative decision making.",2019 Nov 1,2019,"Operative neurosurgery (Hagerstown, Md.)",17,5,503-508,eng,False,10.1093/ons/opz028;5386562;10.1093/ons/opz028,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aphasia, Broca/diagnosis/epidemiology;Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology/*therapy;Child;Clinical Decision-Making;Electroencephalography;Embolization, Therapeutic/*methods;Endovascular Procedures;Evoked Potentials, Somatosensory;Female;Hearing Loss/diagnosis/epidemiology;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/*therapy;Intraoperative Neurophysiological Monitoring/*methods;Male;Median Nerve;Microsurgery;Middle Aged;Muscle Weakness/diagnosis/epidemiology;Nervous System Diseases/*diagnosis/epidemiology;Neurophysiological Monitoring/methods;Paresis/diagnosis/epidemiology;Postoperative Complications/*diagnosis/epidemiology;Predictive Value of Tests;Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Sensitivity and Specificity;Somatosensory Cortex;Tibial Nerve;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",Arteriovenous malformation;Embolization;Neuroendovascular;Neurophysiological monitoring

15028139,"""Tangential"" resection of medial temporal lobe arteriovenous malformations with the orbitozygomatic approach.","OBJECTIVE: Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the medial temporal lobe are usually resected through subtemporal-transcortical approaches that provide a trajectory that is perpendicular to the plane of the AVM. The pterional approach is sometimes used for AVMs in the uncus and amygdala, but it is not recommended for AVMs in the hippocampal region because it provides a ""tangential"" approach with limited access to posterior feeding arteries and draining veins. The orbitozygomatic approach enhances exposure along this tangential trajectory and was used in a consecutive series of 10 patients to determine its advantages. METHODS: During a 5.7-year period, 43 patients underwent resection of temporal lobe AVMs, 10 of which were located in the medial temporal lobe (amygdala and uncus [Region A] or hippocampus, parahippocampus, and fusiform gyrus [Region B]). AVMs were evenly distributed by region and by hemispheric dominance and included two Spetzler-Martin Grade IV lesions. An orbitozygomatic approach was used in all cases. RESULTS: Complete resection was accomplished in nine patients, and one patient underwent multimodality management with postoperative stereotactic radiosurgery. Good outcomes (Rankin outcome score <or=2) were observed in all patients, and six patients were improved neurologically at late follow-up (mean, 1.3 yr). No permanent language deficits were produced by this approach. CONCLUSION: The orbitozygomatic approach maximizes the exposure of the tangential approach to medial temporal lobe AVMs and has advantages over traditional lateral approaches. It provides early access to critical feeding arteries from the anterior choroidal artery, posterior cerebral artery, and posterior communicating artery; it minimizes temporal lobe retraction and risk to the vein of Labbé; and it avoids transcortical incisions or lobectomy that might impact language and memory function. For these reasons, it may be the optimal approach for small- and medium-sized compact AVMs in the dominant medial temporal lobe.",2004 Mar,2004,Neurosurgery,54,3,645-51; discussion 651-2,eng,False,10.1227/01.neu.0000109043.56063.ba,Comparative Study;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Amygdala/blood supply/surgery;Cerebral Angiography;Child;Combined Modality Therapy;Craniotomy/*methods;Dominance, Cerebral/physiology;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Hippocampus/blood supply/surgery;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Angiography;Male;Middle Aged;Neurologic Examination;Orbit/surgery;Parahippocampal Gyrus/blood supply/surgery;Radiosurgery;Temporal Lobe/*blood supply;Treatment Outcome;Zygoma/surgery",

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term imaging and clinical outcomes of GKS in AVM patients who had undergone previous partial embolization and compare the results with patients treated with GKS alone. METHODS: A total of 215 embolized AVMs were analyzed. The mean patient age was 32.9 years. The mean volume of the nidus was 4.6 mL (range, 0.1-29.4 mL), and the mean prescription dose was 19.6 Gy (range, 4-28 Gy). This group was compared with 729 nonembolized AVMs. RESULTS: After embolization and GKS, angiographically confirmed total obliteration of the AVMs was significantly lower (33%) compared with patients in whom GKS was used alone (60.9%; P < .001). However, the mean nidus size was larger and the Spetzler-Martin grade was higher for the embolized AVMs compared with the nonembolized AVMs. Radiation-induced changes occurred more often in the embolized (43.4%) than the nonembolized (33.4%) AVMs (P = .028). Permanent neurological deficits associated with radiation-induced changes occurred in 2.7% of the embolized compared with 1.3% of the nonembolized patients (P = .14). CONCLUSION: In our retrospective and historical series, the long-term results suggest that the obliteration rate is significantly lower in embolized AVMs compared with nonembolized AVMs, also because of the fact that the combined treatment is applied to higher grade AVMs; the percentage of grade III-V AVMs was 58.6% and 48.8% for nonembolized AVMs.",2012 Dec,2012,Neurosurgery,71,6,1139-47; discussion 1147-8,eng,True,10.1227/NEU.0b013e3182720280;10.1227/NEU.0b013e3182720280,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Child;Child, Preschool;Embolization, Therapeutic/*methods;Enbucrilate;Female;Humans;Longitudinal Studies;Magnetic Resonance Angiography;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Radiosurgery/*methods;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",

In this paper, we present intra-operative correction of brain-shift using 3D ultrasound. METHODS: The method is based on image registration of vessels extracted from pre-operative MRA and intra-operative power Doppler-based ultrasound and is fully integrated in the neuronavigation software. RESULTS: We have performed correction of brain-shift in the operating room during surgery and provided the surgeon with updated information. Here, we present data from seven clinical cases with qualitative and quantitative error measures. CONCLUSION: The registration algorithm is fast enough to provide the surgeon with updated information within minutes and accounts for large portions of the experienced shift.

23290419,Glioblastoma with the appearance of arteriovenous malformation: pitfalls in diagnosis.,"OBJECTIVES: Very few cases of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) associated with gliomas were reported so far in the literature. METHODS: Here, we report a rare case of a glioblastoma with an AVM-like lesion and review the existing literature. RESULTS: We report an unusual case of a 72-year old woman, who presented with a progressive history of aphasia, memory deficit, and headache. Initial MRI imaging was suggestive of a high-grade glioma for which a pterional craniotomy was performed. Intraoperatively, the lesion resembled a vascular malformation. Total extirpation of the lesion was verified by intraoperative MR imaging. Initial histopathological analysis revealed an AVM. Due to the discrepancy between the radiologic and histopathologic findings, the patient was monitored at close intervals. Two month later, multiple lesions were visible on MRI imaging, thus, supporting the diagnosis of malignant glioma. Therefore, after reinvestigating the histopathological sections and cutting the paraffin block in additional serial sections, in only 5% of the section a glioblastoma was discerned which was surrounded by an AVM-like lesion.

20644435,Image-guided resection of embolized cerebral arteriovenous malformations based on catheter-based angiography.,"OBJECTIVE: We introduce a technique that enables the use of catheter angiography during image-guided surgery for the resection of previously embolized arteriovenous malformations. METHODS: We used models to test the possibility of matching specific anatomic points 1:1 and the accuracy of merging catheter-based 3-dimensional angiography with standard computed tomographic angiography. RESULTS: After obtaining excellent accuracy matching the 2 modalities, we merged both studies into the image-guidance platform. After embolizing a patient's arteriovenous malformation with Onyx, we successfully used the merged study to navigate during surgical resection of the lesion. No complications resulted from this technique, which increases contrast by only 15 cm and radiation exposure by 4 seconds. CONCLUSION: Catheter-based angiography can be used during image guidance to reduce the artifact from metal particles after embolization. Excellent accuracy was obtained in merging 3-dimensional angiography with computed tomographic angiography. Further studies are needed to evaluate catheter-based 3-dimensional angiography as a single method for navigation during neurovascular surgery.",2010 Aug,2010,Neurosurgery,67,2,471-5,eng,False,10.1227/01.NEU.0000372205.53792.E4;00006123-201008000-00040;10.1227/01.NEU.0000372205.53792.E4,Journal Article,"Angiography, Digital Subtraction;Carotid Artery, Internal/diagnostic imaging/surgery;Catheters;Cerebral Angiography;Contrast Media;Embolization, Therapeutic;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Intracranial Embolism/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Angiography;Neuronavigation/methods;Neurosurgical Procedures/*methods;Phantoms, Imaging;Surgery, Computer-Assisted/*methods;Tomography, X-Ray Computed",

25794338,Endovascular transvenous cure for ruptured brain arteriovenous malformations in complex cases with high Spetzler-Martin grades.,"OBJECT: Ruptured cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) with deep localization and high Spetzler-Martin grades are associated with considerable challenges regarding nidus eradication treatment. The authors report their experience with curative endovascular transvenous embolization in a series of patients harboring ""untreatable"" lesions. METHODS: Between January 2008 and June 2013, a transvenous endovascular embolization protocol was implemented at the authors' institution for consecutive patients with ruptured brain AVMs that were considered incurable by classic endovascular and surgical techniques. Therapeutic decision making was based on Spetzler-Martin grades, AVM location, type of venous drainage, and angioarchitectural evaluation. Complete exclusion of the nidus was the objective of treatment. RESULTS: Twenty patients (10 male and 10 female, mean age 36.7 ± 17.7 years) were included. Initial Spetzler-Martin grades were III-V for 90.0% of the patients. The lesions were deeply seated in 80% and in eloquent locations in 90% of cases. The preprocedural modified Rankin Scale score was 0-2 for 12 of the 20 patients (60.0%), 3 for 2 patients (10.0%), and 4 for 6 patients (30.0%). The postprocedural clinical status was unchanged for all patients. The procedure was technically feasible in all cases. Procedure-related mortality was 0%. Ninety percent of the patients were independent in their everyday lives (modified Rankin Scale Scores 0-2) at the 6-month follow-up. In all cases but one (95%) the embolization was curative, confirmed by selective DSA at 6 months and 18 months postintervention.

31401680,De novo distal middle cerebral artery aneurysm post-excision of intracerebral arteriovenous malformation in an 8-year old.,"Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are frequently associated with concurrent aneurysms. These aneurysms are commonly haemodynamically related to the AVM and can be classified into extranidal or intranidal in reference to the AVM nidus. An aneurysm arising from an artery that does not angiographically contribute to the blood flow to the AVM is uncommon. A distal middle cerebral artery (dMCA) aneurysm itself is also a rare presentation, especially in paediatric population. We present a rare case of dMCA aneurysm that was noted after successful surgical management of a ruptured AVM in an 8-year-old child and its management. BACKGROUND: About 10-30% of patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) have an associated artery aneurysm. The majority of these aneurysms are flow-related to the malformation. These aneurysms can be classified into extranidal or intranidal in reference to the AVM nidus Rammos et al Am J Neuroradiol 37:1966-1971, [1]. An aneurysm arising from a different artery that does not angiographically contribute to the blood flow associated with the AVM is less common and would generally be regarded as unrelated to the AVM. Distal cerebral artery aneurysm itself is also a rare presentation, comprising of 1-7% of all middle cerebral artery aneurysm. In children, mycotic infection and dissection are the two most common causes for aneurysm in this location. Unlike in adults, berry aneurysms are uncommon in children. We describe a young patient who was found to have distal middle cerebral artery (dMCA) aneurysm in follow-up DSA (Digital Subtraction Angiogram) after the initial successful surgical treatment for a cerebral frontal AVM. In this particular case, endovascular repair is thought to be the best strategy to treat the aneurysm. However, there still remains a lack of consensus of the best management strategy (surgery or endovascular) in treating flow-related aneurysms in general. This is usually based on an individual case scenario and the treatment is tailored depending on various factors including the expertise of the treating team.",2019 Nov,2019,Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for,35,11,2211-2218,eng,False,10.1007/s00381-019-04328-4;10.1007/s00381-019-04328-4;10.1007/s00381-019-04328-4,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Aortic Dissection/*diagnostic imaging/therapy;Angiography, Digital Subtraction;Cerebral Angiography;Child;Computed Tomography Angiography;Craniotomy;Embolization, Therapeutic;Female;Humans;Intracranial Aneurysm/*diagnostic imaging/therapy;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/*surgery;Intracranial Hemorrhages/etiology/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Angiography;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Middle Cerebral Artery/*diagnostic imaging;Neuronavigation;Neurosurgical Procedures;Postoperative Complications/*diagnostic imaging/therapy;Rupture, Spontaneous;Tomography, X-Ray Computed",Cerebral arteriovenous malformation;Distal middle cerebral artery aneurysm
25712917,Augmented reality in neurovascular surgery: feasibility and first uses in the operating room.,"PURPOSE: The aim of this report is to present a prototype augmented reality (AR) intra-operative brain imaging system. We present our experience of using this new neuronavigation system in neurovascular surgery and discuss the feasibility of this technology for aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), and arteriovenous fistulae (AVFs). METHODS: We developed an augmented reality system that uses an external camera to capture the live view of the patient on the operating room table and to merge this view with pre-operative volume-rendered vessels. We have extensively tested the system in the laboratory and have used the system in four surgical cases: one aneurysm, two AVMs and one AVF case. RESULTS: The developed AR neuronavigation system allows for precise patient-to-image registration and calibration of the camera, resulting in a well-aligned augmented reality view. Initial results suggest that augmented reality is useful for tailoring craniotomies, localizing vessels of interest, and planning resection corridors. CONCLUSION: Augmented reality is a promising technology for neurovascular surgery. However, for more complex anomalies such as AVMs and AVFs, better visualization techniques that allow one to distinguish between arteries and veins and determine the absolute depth of a vessel of interest are needed.",2015 Nov,2015,International journal of computer assisted radiology and surgery,10,11,1823-36,eng,False,10.1007/s11548-015-1163-8;10.1007/s11548-015-1163-8;10.1007/s11548-015-1163-8,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Arteriovenous Fistula/*surgery;Cerebral Angiography;Craniotomy;Feasibility Studies;Female;Humans;Intracranial Aneurysm/*surgery;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Neuronavigation/*methods;Neurosurgical Procedures/methods;Operating Rooms;Tomography, X-Ray Computed;Vascular Surgical Procedures/methods",Aneurysm;Arteriovenous fistulae;Arteriovenous malformations;Augmented reality;Image-guided surgery;Neurovascular surgery;Visualization
22858682,Intra-arterial intraoperative computed tomography angiography guided navigation: a new technique for localization of vascular pathology.,"BACKGROUND: Precise intraoperative surgical localization of small distal aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), and cranial base dural arteriovenous fistulae may be challenging. Current neuronavigational techniques are based on imaging techniques with limited sensitivity to detect vascular lesions that are small. We introduce the technique of intraoperative computed tomography angiography (iCTA) with an intra-arterial injection for surgical navigation. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether iCTA integrated with a navigation platform is accurate and useful for precise localization of small vascular lesions that are challenging to treat. METHODS: This study included 8 patients: 2 with aneurysms, 3 with small cortical AVMs, and 3 with cranial base dural arteriovenous fistulae. iCTA with intra-arterial contrast injection was performed in all patients for precise localization of the small vascular lesion to facilitate craniotomy planning and microsurgical approach. All operative reports, inpatient and outpatient records, and radiographic studies available were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: : The iCTA was used to target 2 aneurysms, 3 small subcortical AVMs, and 3 dural arteriovenous fistulae. This technique was most helpful to localize the 3 AVMs and the distal M4 aneurysm precisely. Craniotomy planning was accurate in all instances; no complications related to the technique were noted, and all patients had uneventful postoperative recoveries. CONCLUSION: iCTA is an effective and accurate novel technique that can enhance the safety of surgical treatment for small intra-axial vascular pathology.

26615787,The Retrosigmoid Petrosal Fissure Transpeduncular Approach to Central Pontine Lesions.,"BACKGROUND: The advent of improved surgical instruments and neuronavigation and descriptions of safe-entry zones have allowed neurosurgeons to resect brainstem lesions with an acceptable morbidity. The authors describe the technique of petrosal fissure dissection to the lateral transpeduncular safe-entry zone at the middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP) for resection of deep-seated central pontine pathologies. This approach allows the surgeon to obtain less cerebellar retraction and a more direct, more shallow, and shorter approach compared with the approach without opening this fissure. METHODS: An illustrative case is used to highlight the technique of dissecting the petrosal fissure to obtain a direct surgical corridor to the MCP. Anatomic dissections are used to define better the relative relationships of this fissure to the MCP and adjacent structures. RESULTS: Dissection of the petrosal fissure provides a direct trajectory to the lateral transpeduncular entry zone at the MCP and can enhance exposure of this structure, while minimizing morbidity to the corticospinal tract and cerebellum during approaches to central pontine pathologies. CONCLUSIONS: For resection of lesions within the pons via the retrosigmoid craniotomy, dissection of the petrosal fissure allows for a more direct and shorter route to the central pontine and lateral pontine lesion compared with an approach without expansion of this potential space.",2016 Mar,2016,World neurosurgery,87,,235-41,eng,False,S1878-8750(15)01545-4;10.1016/j.wneu.2015.11.025;S1878-8750(15)01545-4;10.1016/j.wneu.2015.11.025,Case Reports;Journal Article,Adult;Brain Stem/surgery;Cerebellum/*surgery;Cranial Nerve Diseases/surgery;Craniotomy/methods;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery;Microsurgery;Neuronavigation;Neurosurgical Procedures/*methods;Petrous Bone/*surgery;Pons/*surgery;Postoperative Complications/epidemiology;Pyramidal Tracts/surgery,Brainstem surgery;Cerebellopontine fissure;Middle cerebellar peduncle;Safe-entry zone

20802361,Expression of endothelial adhesion molecules after radiosurgery in an animal model of arteriovenous malformation.,"BACKGROUND: Endothelial adhesion molecules may be important in the response of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) to radiosurgery. In addition to a putative role in the occlusive process after radiosurgery, they may serve as potential targets for biological strategies to accelerate intravascular thrombosis. OBJECTIVE: To determine the temporal expression of E-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 in an animal model of AVMs. METHODS: Forty-one Sprague-Dawley rats underwent surgical creation of a carotid-to-jugular anastomosis. Radiosurgery (25 Gy) was delivered to the model ""nidus"" after 6 weeks, and the tissue was harvested 1 to 84 days after radiosurgery. Control groups received sham irradiation. Immunofluorescence was used to study the expression of E-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. RESULTS: Endothelial E-selectin expression was limited to regions receiving radiosurgery. E-selectin expression reached maximal expression at 24 hours after radiosurgery and was sustained for another 24 hours before gradually reducing to baseline at 84 days post-radiosurgery (P < .01). Vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression remained at the baseline level for the first week; a 50% increase was observed at 21 days after radiosurgery, which was sustained for another 3 weeks before returning to the baseline at 84 days after radiosurgery (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Radiosurgery stimulates early expression of E-selectin and delayed up-regulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 on the endothelial surface of the AVM model nidus. Cell adhesion molecule expression may play an important role in the process leading to vascular obliteration after irradiation. These molecular alterations may be harnessed to promote thrombosis in the irradiated vasculature using a vascular targeting agent.",2010 Oct,2010,Neurosurgery,67,4,976-83; discussion 983,eng,False,10.1227/NEU.0b013e3181ee36bc;10.1227/NEU.0b013e3181ee36bc,Journal Article,"Animals;Arteriovenous Malformations/*pathology/*surgery;Disease Models, Animal;E-Selectin/metabolism;Endothelium/*metabolism;Gene Expression Regulation/physiology;Male;Radiosurgery/*methods;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Time Factors;Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/*metabolism",

Though generally safe, a multitude of intraprocedural complications that potentially lead to disastrous clinical outcomes may arise. It is crucial for the operators to be well versed with the various techniques that are available to overcome any procedure-specific complications. METHODS: We present 2 cases in which we encountered premature intravascular detachment of the microcatheter tip and coil migration while treating a dural arteriovenous fistula and aneurysm, respectively. We used a stentriever to remove the detached microcatheter tip and suction using the reperfusion catheter to remove the migrated coil, both techniques that have not been reported in the literature thus far.

Two patients who had an incidental finding of an AVM associated with papilloedema are described here. The first was a 13-year-old male who presented after an accidental kick to the eyes. Examination revealed bilateral papilloedema. He gave a 2-year history of intermittent headache. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an unruptured AVM in the temporal lobe. Lumbar puncture revealed elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure. Visual acuity and visual fields were normal. He was treated with acetazolamide and improved within a few weeks. He subsequently underwent stereotactic radiosurgery to the AVM. He discontinued acetazolamide due to adverse side effects and there was no recurrence of headache and papilloedema. The second patient was a 14-year-old male who had polyarticular juvenile chronic arthritis and received low-dose steroids and methotrexate. Bilateral papilloedema was discovered during routine ophthalmology surveillance and he was otherwise asymptomatic neurologically. Brain MRI revealed an AVM in the posterior fossa. He had three embolization procedures, which have resulted in significant reduction in lesion size.

36374476,"Intracranial dural arteriovenous fistula: a comprehensive review of the history, management, and future prospective.","Dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVF) are abnormal acquired intracranial vascular malformations consisting of pathological connections located within the dura between the pial arteries and the veno vasora, comprising the walls of the dural sinuses, bridging veins, or transosseous emissary veins. Dural arteriovenous fistulas are distinguished from arteriovenous malformations by their arterial supply from the vessels that perfuse the dura mater and lack of a parenchymal nidus. They are most commonly situated at the transverse and cavernous sinuses. The mechanism of development behind dural arteriovenous fistula can be explained by the molecular and anatomical factors. Multiple classification systems have been proposed throughout history including; Djindjian and Merland, Cognard, and Borden classification systems. The aggressiveness of the clinical course in intracranial dural arteriovenous fistula can be predicted through the angiographic patterns of venous drainage, more specifically, the presence of cortical venous drainage, the presence of venous ectasia, and the aggressiveness of clinical presentation. Intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas might be discovered incidentally. However, if symptomatic, the clinical presentation ranges from mild neurological deficits to severe, lethal intracranial hemorrhage. Angiography is the imaging of choice to investigate, diagnose, and plan treatment for intracranial dural arteriovenous fistula. The management algorithm of intracranial dural arteriovenous fistula can be broadly divided into conservative, surgical, endovascular, and/or radiosurgical options. With the advent of endovascular therapies, surgery has fallen out of favor for managing intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas.

17707490,Multiple intracranial cavernous malformations: clinical features and treatment.,"BACKGROUND: Although patients with MCMs have increasingly been found in clinics, little has been focused on them. Thus, we intended to investigate these patients' clinical presentations, family history, radiological characters, and treatment strategy. METHODS: A retrospective review of the files and family investigations were conducted for 30 patients with MCMs. All patients underwent MRI examination. Symptomatic patients underwent the surgical treatment with image-guided technique. RESULTS: There were 19 male and 11 female patients with a total 79 lesions. The common presentations were seizures, hemorrhages, or focal neurological deficits. Nine patients had positive or doubtful family history. The FLAIR sequence of MRI showed the highest sensitivity in the detection of CM lesions. In 27 symptomatic patients with 69 lesions, total removal was achieved in 19 patients with 48 lesions. In the other 8 patients with 21 lesions, 13 lesions were removed. Preoperative symptoms were improved in 21 patients and unchanged in 5. Preoperative neurological deficits temporarily worsened in one, and a new onset of seizure occurred in other one; but both gradually improved during the follow-up period. Among 3 patients with asymptomatic MCMs, one patient had hemorrhage during the follow-up period and underwent surgical operation. CONCLUSIONS: Because a high frequency of family CM occurs in MCMs, a detailed family investigation is mandatory for each patient with MCM. Selection of higher sensitive MRI sequence would contribute to detection of more CM lesions.

The treatment choice for DAVFs depends on the type of fistula, the severity of symptoms, DAVF angioarchitecture, and the efficacy and safety of treatments. The use of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in DAVFs started in the late 1970s. There is a delay before the fistula gets obliterated after SRS and there is a risk of hemorrhage from the fistula till the fistula gets obliterated. Initial reports described the role of SRS in small DAVFs without severe symptoms, which were inaccessible by endovascular or surgical measures or in combination with embolization in larger DAVFs. SRS can be appropriate for indirect cavernous sinus DAVF fistulas (Barrow type B, C, and D). Borden types II and III and Cognard types IIb-V DAVFs have a high risk of hemorrhage and are traditionally considered less favorable to be treated with SRS as immediate treatment is required to decrease the risk of hemorrhage. However, recently SRS has been tried in these high-grade DAVF as a monotherapy. Factors that have a positive impact on the obliteration rates of DAVF following SRS are the location of DAVF with the cavernous sinus DAVF having much better obliteration rates than DAVF located at other locations, Borden Type I or Cognard Types III or IV DAVFs, absence of CVD, hemorrhage at the time of initial presentation, and target volume lesser than 1.5 mL.",2023 Mar-Apr,2023,Neurology India,71,Supplement,S109-S114,eng,False,10.4103/0028-3886.373634;ni_2023_71_7_109_373634;10.4103/0028-3886.373634,Journal Article,"Humans;Treatment Outcome;*Radiosurgery;*Embolization, Therapeutic;*Central Nervous System Vascular Malformations/diagnosis;*Arteriovenous Fistula/radiotherapy/surgery;Retrospective Studies",Dural AV fistula;Gamma Knife;SRS

Six months after the operation, the patient presented with new complaints of left arm tremor namely Holmes' tremor. Neurological examination also revealed left-sided internuclear ophthalmoplegia, left-sided mild paresis, and increased deep tendon reflexes of the left upper extremity, truncal ataxia, and dysarthria. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed a postoperative cavity and gliosis at the level of the superior and inferior colliculus in the right tegmentum and right red nucleus with extension to the substantia nigra. Fahn-Tolosa-Marin tremor rating scale (TRS) for his left upper extremity (Part A, score 6) was 11 for the proximal and the distal arm. After the failure of medical treatment, the patient underwent right globus pallidum internus and ventral intermediate thalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation. There were no side effects related to the stimulation. Final TRS months after operation was 3 for the proximal and 4 for the distal arm.",2013 Jul,2013,"Journal of neurological surgery.

19238639,Rotational flat-panel computed tomography in diagnostic and interventional neuroradiology.,"Originally aimed at improving standard radiography by providing higher absorption efficiency and a wider dynamic range than available with X-ray film or film-screen combinations, flat-panel detector technology has become widely accepted for neuroangiographic imaging. In particular flat-panel detector computed tomography (FD-CT) which uses rotational C-arm-mounted flat-panel detector technology is capable of volumetric imaging with high spatial resolution. As ""Angiographic CT"" FD-CT may be helpful during many diagnostic and neurointerventional procedures, i.e. intracranial stenting for cerebrovascular stenoses, stent-assisted coil embolization of wide-necked cerebral aneurysms and embolizations of arteriovenous malformations. By providing morphologic, CT-like images of the brain within the angio suite, FD-CT is able to rapidly visualize periprocedural hemorrhage and may thus improve rapid complication management without the need for patient transfer. In addition, myelography and postmyelographic FD-CT imaging can be carried out using a single machine. Spinal interventions, such as kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty might also benefit from FD-CT. This paper briefly reviews the technical principles of FD technology and then focuses on possible applications in diagnostic and interventional neuroradiology.",2008 Oct,2008,RoFo : Fortschritte auf dem Gebiete der Rontgenstrahlen und der Nuklearmedizin,180,10,891-8,eng,False,10.1055/s-2008-1027741;10.1055/s-2008-1027741,Journal Article,"Central Nervous System Diseases/*diagnostic imaging/therapy;Central Nervous System Vascular Malformations/diagnostic imaging/therapy;Cerebral Angiography/*instrumentation;Embolization, Therapeutic/instrumentation;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/*instrumentation;Imaging, Three-Dimensional/*instrumentation;Intracranial Aneurysm/diagnostic imaging/therapy;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/therapy;Neuronavigation/*instrumentation;Sensitivity and Specificity;Spinal Stenosis/diagnostic imaging/therapy;Spondylosis/diagnostic imaging/therapy;Stents;Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*instrumentation;Vertebroplasty/instrumentation",
20421146,Integration of functional MRI and white matter tractography in stereotactic radiosurgery clinical practice.,"PURPOSE: To study the efficacy of the integration of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging tractography data into stereotactic radiosurgery clinical practice. METHODS AND MATERIALS: fMRI and tractography data sets were acquired and fused with corresponding anatomical MR and computed tomography images of patients with arteriovenous malformation (AVM), astrocytoma, brain metastasis, or hemangioma and referred for stereotactic radiosurgery. The acquired data sets were imported into a CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery system and used to delineate the target, organs at risk, and nearby functional structures and fiber tracts. Treatment plans with and without the incorporation of the functional structures and the fiber tracts into the optimization process were developed and compared. RESULTS: The nearby functional structures and fiber tracts could receive doses of >50% of the maximum dose if they were excluded from the planning process. In the AVM case, the doses received by the Broadmann-17 structure and the optic tract were reduced to 700 cGy from 1,400 cGy and to 1,200 cGy from 2,000 cGy, respectively, upon inclusion into the optimization process. In the metastasis case, the motor cortex received 850 cGy instead of 1,400 cGy; and in the hemangioma case, the pyramidal tracts received 780 cGy instead of 990 cGy. In the astrocytoma case, the dose to the motor cortex bordering the lesion was reduced to 1,900 cGy from 2,100 cGy, and therefore, the biologically equivalent dose in three fractions was delivered instead. CONCLUSIONS: Functional structures and fiber tracts could receive high doses if they were not considered during treatment planning. With the aid of fMRI and tractography images, they can be delineated and spared.",2010 Sep 1,2010,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",78,1,257-67,eng,False,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2009.10.064;S0360-3016(09)03546-9;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2009.10.064,Case Reports;Evaluation Study;Journal Article,"Adult;Astrocytoma/diagnostic imaging/pathology/surgery;*Brain Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/pathology/secondary/surgery;Brain Stem Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/pathology/surgery;Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/diagnostic imaging/secondary/surgery;Diffusion Tensor Imaging/methods;Female;Hemangioma, Cavernous, Central Nervous System/diagnostic;Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/pathology/surgery;Lung Neoplasms/pathology;Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods;Male;Middle Aged;Motor Cortex/anatomy & histology/diagnostic imaging/radiation effects;Pyramidal Tracts/anatomy & histology/diagnostic imaging/radiation effects;Radiation Injuries/*prevention & control;Radiography;Radiosurgery/*methods;Radiotherapy Dosage;Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted/methods;Visual Pathways/anatomy & histology/diagnostic imaging/radiation effects",
19795964,Misleading functional magnetic resonance imaging mapping of the cortical hand representation in a 4-year-old boy with an arteriovenous malformation of the central region.,"Functional MR imaging is dependent on the hemodynamic response function of the brain. Cerebrovascular anomalies may lead to hemodynamic artifacts, contorting the true localization of neural activation. This is illustrated in the case of a 4-year-old boy with an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) of the left central region undergoing extensive functional mapping prior to surgical removal. Intraoperative electrophysiological recording confirmed presurgical results of magnetoencephalography (MEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) examinations, detecting the sensorimotor hand representation within the brain tissue into which the AVM extended, whereas the activation demonstrated by functional MR (fMR) imaging was proven to be falsely localized by that modality, which showed it to be posterior to the affected central region. Thus, this case demonstrates that functional mapping can be performed even in very young patients and that combining fMR imaging with TMS and MEG is especially important in patients with vascular lesions, in whom fMR imaging can be misleading due to changes in blood flow.",2009 Oct,2009,Journal of neurosurgery.

32534263,Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber Syndrome Associated with Multiple Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformations: Usefulness of Gamma Knife Stereotactic Radiosurgery in This Syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome (KTWS) is characterized by the presence of a combined vascular malformation of capillaries, veins, and lymphatic vessels; congenital venous abnormalities; and limb hypertrophy. Its association with neurovascular abnormalities is infrequent, and the presence of intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is extremely rare. CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case of a 48-year-old male diagnosed with KTWS who spontaneously presented with a cerebral hemorrhage. Computed tomography scan and angio-computed tomography studies revealed bleeding associated with AVM rupture. In the conventional arteriography study, 10 small (<1 cm) AVMs were observed. The patient presented a good clinical recovery. These multiple small lesions were not considered susceptible to surgical or endovascular treatments. Therefore all lesions were treated with Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery since it attains the highest dose drop and minimal irradiation of the healthy parenchyma. One year after the treatment, the lesions have shrunk. CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral AVMs are extremely rare in KTWS cases; however, their presence can have serious consequences if they are treated. We find it advisable to include brain imaging tests, such as nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, to diagnose and monitor KTWS. Furthermore, a Gamma Knife may be useful when multiple AVMs are present.",2020 Sep,2020,World neurosurgery,141,,425-429,eng,False,S1878-8750(20)31270-5;10.1016/j.wneu.2020.06.012;S1878-8750(20)31270-5;10.1016/j.wneu.2020.06.012,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Cerebral Hemorrhage/diagnosis/*surgery;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*complications/diagnosis/*surgery;Kaplan-Meier Estimate;Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber Syndrome/*complications/diagnosis/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods;Male;Middle Aged;Tomography, X-Ray Computed/methods",Arteriovenous malformations;Gamma Knife;Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome;Stereotactic radiosurgery
22986598,Transvenous coil embolization of an intraorbital arteriovenous fistula: case report and review of the literature.,"BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE: Purely intraorbital arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs), which are rare vascular malformations that clinically mimic carotid-cavernous fistulas (CCFs), involve a fistula from the ophthalmic artery to 1 of the draining ophthalmic veins. We describe a case of an intraorbital AVF treated with transvenous endovascular coil embolization via the inferior petrosal sinus (IPS) route and review the literature on this rare entity. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: An 81-year-old woman sought treatment after 7 days of progressive left-sided visual acuity loss, chemosis, and lateral rectus palsy. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated dilated vascularity in the left orbit raising suspicions for a CCF. Cerebral angiography showed a purely intraorbital AVF with a fistula between the left ophthalmic artery and superior ophthalmic vein (SOV). Transvenous selective catheterization of the fistula was performed by successfully navigating the ipsilateral IPS to the cavernous sinus and SOV. The fistula was then embolized using detachable coils. The patient was discharged the next day. Three weeks after embolization, her ocular symptoms and findings had resolved. CONCLUSION: Intraorbital AVFs are a rare type of AVF that can be treated by direct surgical ligation, transarterial embolization, or transvenous embolization. We successfully navigated the IPS, which is frequently stenotic or occluded secondary to chronically increased fistulous drainage, and utilized this route to embolize the fistula with detachable coils.",2013 Jan,2013,Neurosurgery,72,1,E130-4; discussion E134,eng,False,10.1227/NEU.0b013e31827242cb;10.1227/NEU.0b013e31827242cb,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Aged, 80 and over;Arteriovenous Fistula/*surgery;Cerebral Angiography;Constriction, Pathologic/surgery;Cranial Sinuses/surgery;Diplopia/etiology;Embolization, Therapeutic/*methods;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Angiography;Neuronavigation;Ophthalmic Artery/surgery;Orbit/*surgery;Treatment Outcome;Vision Disorders/etiology",
24411044,Vaginal cesarean section for second-trimester therapeutic abortion.,"OBJECTIVE: Pregnancy does not increase the risk of bleeding from a brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM), but once an AVM has bled during pregnancy, the rate of rebleeding during the same pregnancy is high. Therefore, termination of the pregnancy is an option for patients in whom the AVM is located in an eloquent area. We report a woman with an intracerebral hemorrhage from a brain AVM who underwent a second-trimester therapeutic abortion by vaginal cesarean section. CASE REPORT: A 30-year-old multiparous woman visited our emergency department at 17 weeks of gestation complaining of a sudden-onset headache with vomiting. She had no history of headaches or seizures. Based on the clinical presentation, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, we made a clinical diagnosis of Spetzler-Martin Grade III AVM. Before undergoing stereotactic radiosurgery as a primary treatment, we advised her to terminate her pregnancy and performed a vaginal cesarean section at 19 weeks of gestation. Two months later, the patient underwent gamma knife surgery for the underlying lesion, without complications. Follow-up angiography and magnetic resonance imaging showed that the AVM had disappeared completely. CONCLUSION: Although its indications are limited, vaginal cesarean section is a useful option for terminating a pregnancy that compensates for the disadvantages of dilatation and curettage and systemic abortifacients.",2013 Dec,2013,Taiwanese journal of obstetrics & gynecology,52,4,564-7,eng,False,S1028-4559(13)00182-4;10.1016/j.tjog.2013.10.019;S1028-4559(13)00182-4;10.1016/j.tjog.2013.10.019,Case Reports;Journal Article,"*Abortion, Therapeutic;Adult;Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/*surgery;Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology/*surgery;Cesarean Section/*methods;Female;Humans;Pregnancy;Pregnancy Trimester, Second;Radiosurgery;Vagina/surgery",arteriovenous malformation;pregnancy termination;stereotactic radiosurgery;vaginal cesarean section;vaginal hysterotomy
22922676,Angioarchitecture determines obliteration rate after radiosurgery in brain arteriovenous malformations.,"BACKGROUND: Radiosurgery as a potential treatment modality for brain arteriovenous malformations (AVM) has 60% to 90% obliteration rates. OBJECTIVE: To test whether AVM angioarchitecture determines obliteration rate after radiosurgery. METHODS: This study was a retrospective analysis of 139 patients with AVM who underwent radiosurgery. Multiple angioarchitectural characteristics were reviewed on conventional angiogram on the day of radiosurgery: enlargement of feeding arteries, flow-related or intranidal aneurysms, perinidal angiogenesis, arteriovenous transit time, nidus type, venous ectasia, focal pouches, venous rerouting, and presence of a pseudophlebitic pattern. The radiation plan was reviewed for nidus volume and eloquence of AVM location. A chart review was performed to determine clinical presentation and previous treatment. Outcome was dichotomized into complete/incomplete obliteration, and various statistics were performed, examining whether outcome status was associated with the investigated factors. RESULTS: Marginal dose ranged from 15 to 25 Gy (mean, 18.8 Gy), with lower doses prescribed in eloquent locations. Sizes of AVMs ranged from 0.08 to 21 cm (mean, 3.78 ± 4.19 cm). Complete AVM obliteration was achieved in 92 patients (66%) and was related to these independent factors: noneloquent location (odds ratio [OR], 3.20), size (OR, 0.88), low flow (OR, 3.47), no or mild arterial enlargement (OR, 3.32), and absence of perinidal angiogenesis (OR, 2.61). Concerning the 3 last angioarchitectural characteristics, if no or only a single factor was present in an individual patient (n = 92 patients), obliteration was observed in 74 (80%); if 2 or 3 factors were present (n = 47), obliteration was observed in 18 patients (38%; OR, 6.62). CONCLUSION: Angioarchitectural factors that indicate high flow are associated with a lower rate of AVM obliteration after radiosurgery.",2012 Dec,2012,Neurosurgery,71,6,1071-8; discussion 1079,eng,True,10.1227/NEU.0b013e31826f79ec;10.1227/NEU.0b013e31826f79ec,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Angiography, Digital Subtraction;Arteriovenous Malformations/*physiopathology/*surgery;Brain/pathology;Brain Neoplasms/*surgery;Child;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Neovascularization, Pathologic/*pathology;Particle Accelerators;Predictive Value of Tests;Radiosurgery/*methods;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",
30544301,A novel method to determine the natural course of unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations without the need for follow-up information.,"OBJECTIVEThere is a strong clinical need to accurately determine the average annual hemorrhage risk in unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). This need motivated the present initiative to use data from a uniquely large patient population and design a novel methodology to achieve a risk determination with unprecedented accuracy. The authors also aimed to determine the impact of sex, pregnancy, AVM volume, and location on the risk for AVM rupture.METHODSThe present study does not consider any specific management of the AVMs, but only uses the age distribution for the first hemorrhage, the shape of which becomes universal for a sufficiently large set of patients. For this purpose, the authors collected observations, including age at first hemorrhage and AVM size and location, in 3425 patients. The average annual risk for hemorrhage could then be determined from the simple relation that the number of patients with their first hemorrhage at a specific age equals the risk for hemorrhage times the number of patients at risk at that age. For a subset of the patients, the information regarding occurrence of AVM hemorrhage after treatment of the first hemorrhage was used for further analysis of the influence on risk from AVM location and pregnancy.RESULTSThe age distribution for the first AVM hemorrhage was used to determine the average annual risk for hemorrhage in unruptured AVMs at adult ages (25-60 years). It was concluded to be 3.1% ± 0.2% and unrelated to AVM volume but influenced by its location, with the highest risk for centrally located AVMs. The hemorrhage risk was found to be significantly higher for females in their fertile years.CONCLUSIONSThe present methodology allowed the authors to determine the average annual risk for the first AVM hemorrhage at 3.1% ± 0.2% without the need for individual patient follow-up. This methodology has potential also for other similar types of investigations. The conclusion that centrally located AVMs carry a higher risk was confirmed by follow-up information. Follow-up information was also used to conclude that pregnancy causes a substantially greater AVM hemorrhage risk. The age distribution for AVM hemorrhage is incompatible with AVMs present at birth having the same hemorrhage risk as AVMs in adults. Plausibly, they instead develop in the early years of life, possibly with a lower hemorrhage risk during that time period.",2018 Dec 1,2018,Journal of neurosurgery,129,Suppl1,10-16,eng,False,2018.7.GKS181278;10.3171/2018.7.GKS181278;2018.7.GKS181278;10.3171/2018.7.GKS181278,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Cerebral Hemorrhage/diagnosis/epidemiology;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Humans;Infant;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnosis/epidemiology/therapy;Male;Middle Aged;Prognosis;Risk Assessment/methods;Young Adult",AVM;AVM = arteriovenous malformation;GKS = Gamma Knife surgery;hemorrhage;risk;stereotactic radiosurgery;vascular disorders
29191526,Clinical Application of an Open-Source 3D Volume Rendering Software to Neurosurgical Approaches.,"BACKGROUND: Preoperative recognition of the anatomic individualities of each patient can help to achieve more precise and less invasive approaches. It also may help to anticipate potential complications and intraoperative difficulties. Here we describe the use, accuracy, and precision of a free tool for planning microsurgical approaches using 3-dimensional (3D) reconstructions from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: We used the 3D volume rendering tool of a free open-source software program for 3D reconstruction of images of surgical sites obtained by MRI volumetric acquisition. We recorded anatomic reference points, such as the sulcus and gyrus, and vascularization patterns for intraoperative localization of lesions. Lesion locations were confirmed during surgery by intraoperative ultrasound and/or electrocorticography and later by postoperative MRI. RESULTS: Between August 2015 and September 2016, a total of 23 surgeries were performed using this technique for 9 low-grade gliomas, 7 high-grade gliomas, 4 cortical dysplasias, and 3 arteriovenous malformations. The technique helped delineate lesions with an overall accuracy of 2.6 ± 1.0 mm. 3D reconstructions were successfully performed in all patients, and images showed sulcus, gyrus, and venous patterns corresponding to the intraoperative images. All lesion areas were confirmed both intraoperatively and at the postoperative evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: With the technique described herein, it was possible to successfully perform 3D reconstruction of the cortical surface.

METHODS: We performed intraoperative resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (irs-fMRI) in 24 patients under anesthesia before and after lesion resection. Correlation matrices were established for each session (a total 48 of sessions). We analyzed the changes in overall FC and in FC of the healthy and operated hemispheres between the first and second sessions. We tested the correlation between changes in FC and clinical outcomes and the duration, rate, and total dosage of anesthesia. We also performed a group analysis to detect topographic changes in RSNs in patients under anesthesia. A single-subject analysis was performed to detect clinically relevant RSNs in each patient. RESULTS: FC decreased significantly in the second session, as did interhemispheric connectivity. The decrease in the pathological hemisphere was significant and significantly greater than the decrease in the intrahemispheric connectivity of the healthy hemisphere. The change in FC was not correlated with clinical outcome or with the duration, rate, or dosage of anesthesia. Group analysis showed topographic changes in RSNs, especially in high-level networks such as default mode and salience networks. Identification of clinically relevant networks was also possible. CONCLUSIONS: FC and RSNs could be identified under anesthesia and used for extended brain mapping. Further studies are needed to optimize the depth of hypnosis to stabilize FC between sessions.",2020 Jan,2020,World neurosurgery,133,,e197-e204,eng,False,S1878-8750(19)32344-7;10.1016/j.wneu.2019.08.188;S1878-8750(19)32344-7;10.1016/j.wneu.2019.08.188,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Brain Neoplasms/*diagnostic imaging/surgery;Child, Preschool;Connectome/*methods;Female;Glioma/*diagnostic imaging/surgery;Hemangioma, Cavernous/*diagnostic imaging/surgery;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnostic imaging/surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods;Male;Middle Aged;Neuronavigation/*methods;Radiography, Interventional/*methods;*Surgery, Computer-Assisted;Young Adult",Functional connectivity;Intraoperative brain mapping;Resting state fMRI
33004601,"Brain arteriovenous malformations: A review of natural history, pathobiology, and interventions.","Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are anomalous direct shunts between cerebral arteries and veins that convalesce into a vascular nidus. The treatment strategies for AVMs are challenging and variable. Intracranial hemorrhage and seizures comprise the most common presentations of AVMs. However, incidental AVMs are being diagnosed with increasing frequency due to widespread use of noninvasive neuroimaging. The balance between the estimated cumulative lifetime hemorrhage risk vs the risk of intervention is often the major determinant for treatment. Current management options include surgical resection, embolization, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), and observation. Complete nidal obliteration is the goal of AVM intervention. The risks and benefits of interventions vary and can be used in a combinatorial fashion. Resection of the AVM nidus affords high rates of immediate obliteration, but it is invasive and carries a moderate risk of neurologic morbidity. AVM embolization is minimally invasive, but cure can only be achieved in a minority of lesions. SRS is also minimally invasive and has little immediate morbidity, but AVM obliteration occurs in a delayed fashion, so the patient remains at risk of hemorrhage during the latency period. Whether obliteration can be achieved in unruptured AVMs with a lower risk of stroke or death compared with the natural history of AVMs remains controversial. Over the past 5 years, multicenter prospective and retrospective studies describing AVM natural history and treatment outcomes have been published. This review provides a contemporary and comprehensive discussion of the natural history, pathobiology, and interventions for brain AVMs.",2020 Nov 17,2020,Neurology,95,20,917-927,eng,False,10.1212/WNL.0000000000010968;WNL.0000000000010968;10.1212/WNL.0000000000010968,Journal Article;Review,"Arteriovenous Fistula/complications/etiology/pathology/*therapy;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous;*Outcome Assessment, Health Care",
34998042,Paediatric Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformation: Outcomes from a Singapore Children's Hospital.,"OBJECTIVES: Paediatric brain arteriovenous malformation (bAVM) is a rare and distinct clinical entity. There is a growing body of literature that support the success of multimodality approaches for this difficult condition. The authors aim to firstly, describe our institutional experience with a consecutive series of patients and next, corroborate our results with current literature. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a single institution, retrospective study conducted over a 20-year period. Patients less than 19 years old with bAVM were included. Variables of interest included patient demographics, clinical presentation, neuroimaging features, bAVM characteristics and treatment modality. Functional outcomes were measured with modified Rankin scale (mRS). RESULTS: There were 58 paediatric bAVMs, presenting at a mean age of 8.7 ± 4.2 years, and followed up for a mean duration of 7.7 years. Thirty-six patients (62.1%) underwent microsurgical resection, 10 patients had stereotactic radiosurgery (17.2%) and 2 patients had endovascular treatment (3.4%). 50 patients (86.2%) had a favourable outcome at 1-year follow up. Microsurgical resection and SRS had similar obliteration rates (resection 83.3%; SRS 80.0%) and recurrence (resection 10.0%; SRS 12.5%). There were 6 cases of bAVM recurrence (12.8%).

38468045,Fractal-Based Analysis of Arteriovenous Malformations (AVMs).,"Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are cerebrovascular lesions consisting of a pathologic tangle of the vessels characterized by a core termed the nidus, which is the ""nest"" where the fistulous connections occur. AVMs can cause headache, stroke, and/or seizures. Their treatment can be challenging requiring surgery, endovascular embolization, and/or radiosurgery as well. AVMs' morphology varies greatly among patients, and there is still a lack of standardization of angioarchitectural parameters, which can be used as morphometric parameters as well as potential clinical biomarkers (e.g., related to prognosis).In search of new diagnostic and prognostic neuroimaging biomarkers of AVMs, computational fractal-based models have been proposed for describing and quantifying the angioarchitecture of the nidus. In fact, the fractal dimension (FD) can be used to quantify AVMs' branching pattern. Higher FD values are related to AVMs characterized by an increased number and tortuosity of the intranidal vessels or to an increasing angioarchitectural complexity as a whole. Moreover, FD has been investigated in relation to the outcome after Gamma Knife radiosurgery, and an inverse relationship between FD and AVM obliteration was found.Taken altogether, FD is able to quantify in a single and objective value what neuroradiologists describe in qualitative and/or semiquantitative way, thus confirming FD as a reliable morphometric neuroimaging biomarker of AVMs and as a potential surrogate imaging biomarker. Moreover, computational fractal-based techniques are under investigation for the automatic segmentation and extraction of the edges of the nidus in neuroimaging, which can be relevant for surgery and/or radiosurgery planning.",2024,2024,Advances in neurobiology,36,,413-428,eng,False,10.1007/978-3-031-47606-8_21;10.1007/978-3-031-47606-8_21,Journal Article,Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/surgery;Fractals;Retrospective Studies;Prognosis;Biomarkers,AVM;Angioarchitecture;Arteriovenous malformation;Box counting;Fractal dimension;Gamma Knife radiosurgery;Minkowski dimension;Outcome
29454128,Preoperative 3-Dimensional Angiography Data and Intraoperative Real-Time Vascular Data Integrated in Microscope-Based Navigation by Automatic Patient Registration Applying Intraoperative Computed Tomography.,"OBJECTIVE: To establish a workflow integrating preoperative 3-dimensional (3D) angiography data and intraoperative real-time vascular information in microscope-based navigation for aneurysm and arteriovenous malformation (AVM) surgery. METHODS: In 7 patients (3 with AVMs and 4 with aneurysms), preoperative 3D rotational angiography or computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance angiography data were navigated applying a 32-slice movable CT scanner for low-dose registration scanning. The 3D vasculature was segmented and visualized by microscope-based navigation along with navigated intraoperative real-time imaging data from indocyanin green angiography and duplex ultrasonography. RESULTS: Automatic registration applying intraoperative CT resulted in high accuracy (registration error, 0.80 ± 0.79 mm). The effective radiation dose of the registration CT scans (0.28-0.42 mSv) was only approximately one-sixth of a standard diagnostic head CT scan. The 3D vessel architecture could be visualized accurately in the operating microscope heads-up display and on the navigation screens in the same projection as the view angle of the surgeon, both facilitating orientation in 3D space, providing a better understanding of anatomy. In addition, intraoperative real-time modalities could be coregistered with high precision, providing further information during the course of the vascular procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Registration CT imaging facilitates integrating preoperative and intraoperative vascular image data with a low registration error and low radiation exposure for the patient, improving the understanding of 3D vascular anatomy during surgery with easier identification of feeding vessels in AVMs, and of the projection and configuration of aneurysms.",2018 May,2018,World neurosurgery,113,,e414-e425,eng,False,S1878-8750(18)30315-2;10.1016/j.wneu.2018.02.045;S1878-8750(18)30315-2;10.1016/j.wneu.2018.02.045,Journal Article,"Adult;Aged;Automation;Cerebral Angiography/*methods;Computer Systems;Female;Fluorescent Dyes;Humans;*Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Indocyanine Green;Intracranial Aneurysm/*diagnostic imaging/surgery;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Intraoperative Care/*methods;Magnetic Resonance Angiography/instrumentation/*methods;Male;Middle Aged;Multidetector Computed Tomography/instrumentation/*methods;Neuronavigation/instrumentation/*methods;Patient Positioning/*methods;Preoperative Care/*methods;Radiation Dosage;Ultrasonography, Doppler, Duplex;Workflow",3-dimensional rotational angiography;Aneurysm and arteriovenous malformation surgery;Duplex ultrasonography;Indocyanin green angiography;Intraoperative computed tomography;Navigation registration
24639144,Functional brain mapping of patients with arteriovenous malformations using navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation: first experience in ten patients.,"BACKGROUND: Intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVM) are known to be potent inductors of functional plasticity, and their vasculature makes standard functional imaging difficult. Here we conducted functional mapping of both primary motor cortex and speech related areas in patients with AVM using navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS), which has been recently proven as a reliable noninvasive modality of preoperative functional brain mapping. METHOD: nTMS mapping was performed in ten patients with unruptured intracranial AVMs located in or near eloquent areas. Motor mapping was conducted for six patients with AVMs near the rolandic region, and speech mapping was performed for four patients with left perisylvian AVMs. After the examination, all patients were treated with surgery, radiosurgery or observed with best medical treatment on case-by-case basis. RESULTS: Motor mapping allowed for delineation of the primary motor cortex, even if the anatomy was severely obscured by the AVM in all cases with rolandic AVMs. No plastic relocation of the primary motor cortex was observed. Repetitive stimulation of the left ventral precentral gyrus led to speech impairments in all four cases that underwent speech mapping. Right hemispheric involvement was observed in one out of four cases and potentially indicated plastic changes. No side effects were observed. CONCLUSION: nTMS allowed for detailed delineation of eloquent areas even within hypervascularized cortical areas. Our observations indicate that nTMS functional mapping is feasible not only in tumorous brain lesions, but also in AVMs.",2014 May,2014,Acta neurochirurgica,156,5,885-95,eng,False,10.1007/s00701-014-2043-7;10.1007/s00701-014-2043-7,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adult;Aged;Arteriovenous Fistula/*physiopathology;Brain Mapping/*methods;Evoked Potentials, Motor/physiology;Female;Frontal Lobe/*physiopathology;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*physiopathology;Male;Middle Aged;Motor Cortex/*physiopathology;Neuronavigation/*methods;Pilot Projects;Speech/physiology;Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation/*methods;Young Adult",
25175441,Smoking is a negative predictor of arteriovenous malformation posttreatment obliteration: analysis of vascular risk factors in 774 patients.,"OBJECT: Cigarette smoking has been well established as a risk factor in vascular pathology, such as cerebral aneurysms. However, tobacco's implications for patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are controversial. The object of this study was to identify predictors of AVM obliteration and risk factors for complications. METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database for all patients with AVMs treated using surgical excision, staged endovascular embolization (with N-butyl-cyanoacrylate or Onyx), stereotactic radiosurgery (Gamma Knife or Linear Accelerator), or a combination thereof between 1994 and 2010. Medical risk factors, such as smoking, abuse of alcohol or intravenous recreational drugs, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and coronary artery disease, were documented. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to detect predictors of periprocedural complications, obliteration, and posttreatment hemorrhage. RESULTS: Of 774 patients treated at a single tertiary care cerebrovascular center, 35% initially presented with symptomatic hemorrhage and 57.6% achieved complete obliteration according to digital subtraction angiography (DSA) or MRI. In a multivariate analysis a negative smoking history (OR 1.9, p = 0.006) was a strong independent predictor of AVM obliteration. Of the patients with obliterated AVMs, 31.9% were smokers, whereas 45% were not (p = 0.05). Multivariate analysis of obliteration, after controlling for AVM size and location (eloquent vs noneloquent tissue), revealed that nonsmokers were more likely (0.082) to have obliterated AVMs through radiosurgery. Smoking was not predictive of treatment complications or posttreatment hemorrhage. Abuse of alcohol or intravenous recreational drugs, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease had no discernible effect on AVM obliteration, periprocedural complications, or posttreatment hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral AVM patients with a history of smoking are significantly less likely than those without a smoking history to have complete AVM obliteration on follow-up DSA or MRI. Therefore, patients with AVMs should be strongly advised to quit smoking.",2014 Sep,2014,Neurosurgical focus,37,3,E3,eng,False,10.3171/20145.FOCUS14121;10.3171/20145.FOCUS14121,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/*epidemiology/*surgery;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Humans;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Logistic Models;Male;Middle Aged;Postoperative Complications/epidemiology;Postoperative Hemorrhage/epidemiology;Predictive Value of Tests;Prospective Studies;Radiosurgery/*adverse effects;Retrospective Studies;Risk Factors;Smoking/*epidemiology/psychology;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",AVM = arteriovenous malformation;DSA = digital subtraction angiography;SM = Spetzler-Martin;SRS = stereotactic radiosurgery;arteriovenous malformation;hemorrhage;smoking

In contrast to previous similar cases, his history included no evidence of trigeminal neuralgia or sensory loss. Right vertebral artery angiography revealed a doubled superior cerebellar artery feeding the angioma nidus. The patient refused radiotherapy and preferred surgical treatment. Intraoperatively, a close relationship between arterial feeders and rootlets of the trigeminal nerve was observed. Complete removal of the malformation was achieved and confirmed angiographically. The postoperative course was complicated by subdural hygroma that required repeated drainage and eventually a shunting procedure.

We describe two patients that developed aggressive, symptomatic large cysts at more than 4 and 12years after GKS for VS, although the tumor control for these patients had been acceptable at 3 and 11years, respectively. During the surgery, a reddish lesion, which was distinct from the surrounding tumor, was observed. The microscopic examination of the reddish lesion revealed dilated capillary vessels and hemorrhage, which was compatible with late radiation changes; these were usually seen in arteriovenous malformations following radiosurgery.

30862580,(18)F-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography-Magnetic Resonance Monitoring of Brain Metabolic Changes in a Case of Arteriovenous Malformation-Related Steal Phenomenon Symptoms.,"BACKGROUND: Unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) represent a complex disease in young healthy adults. Most often AVMs are clinically silent but also can display a neurologic syndrome due to hypoperfusion/hypometabolism in perilesional brain tissue called steal phenomenon. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 34-year-old woman was admitted to a secondary neurologic center complaining of a right hemiparesis and secondarily generalized seizures. Computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed a left prerolandic AVM without signs of acute or previous bleedings. Digital subtraction angiography confirmed a left juxta-central AVM, with a diffuse pattern, fed by hypertrophic rolandic branches from the left middle cerebral artery. An (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance imaging scan was performed 3 days after the critical episode. A significant hypometabolism in parenchymal regions ipsilaterally to the AVM was detected. Two embolization sessions were performed by means of N-butyl cyanoacrylate glue. At the end of the second procedure, a decrease of the shunt-flow and AVM size was observed. Six months later, (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance imaging scan showed persistent hypometabolism located in the AVM area, with a significant improvement of the cortical hemispheric hypometabolism. The patient was asymptomatic and was sent to stereotactic radiosurgery to complete the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In clinical practice, irritative symptoms in patients with unruptured AVMs could lead to erroneous evaluations. In case of fluctuating clinical syndromes, like our case, establishing that symptoms are related to a steal phenomenon is usually difficult.",2019 Jun,2019,World neurosurgery,126,,276-279,eng,False,S1878-8750(19)30590-X;10.1016/j.wneu.2019.02.167;S1878-8750(19)30590-X;10.1016/j.wneu.2019.02.167,Journal Article,"Adult;Embolization, Therapeutic;Female;Fluorodeoxyglucose F18;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnostic imaging/metabolism/therapy;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Positron-Emission Tomography;Subclavian Steal Syndrome/*diagnostic imaging/metabolism;Tomography, X-Ray Computed;Treatment Outcome",(18)F-FDG PET/MRI;AVM;Embolization;Steal phenomenon
25175430,Management of intracranial aneurysms associated with arteriovenous malformations.,"Intracranial or brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVMs) are some of the most interesting and challenging lesions treated by the cerebrovascular neurosurgeon. It is generally believed that the combination of BAVMs and intracranial aneurysms (IAs) is associated with higher hemorrhage rates at presentation and higher rehemorrhage rates and thus with a more aggressive course and natural history. There is wide variation in the literature on the prevalence of BAVM-associated aneurysms (range 2.7%-58%), with 10%-20% being most often cited in the largest case series. The risk of intracranial hemorrhage in patients with unruptured BAVMs and coexisting IAs has been reported to be 7% annually, compared with 2%-4% annually for those with BAVM alone. Several different classification systems have been applied in an attempt to better understand the natural history of this combination of lesions and implications for treatment. Independent of the classification used, it is clear that a few subtypes of aneurysms have a direct hemodynamic correlation with the BAVM itself. This is exemplified by the fact that the presence of a distal flow-related or an intranidal aneurysm appears to be associated with an increased hemorrhage risk, when compared with an aneurysm located on a vessel with no direct supply to the BAVM nidus. Debate still exists regarding the etiology of the association between those two vascular lesions, the subsequent implications for patients' risk of hemorrhagic stroke, and finally the determination of which patients warrant treatment and when. The ultimate goals of the treatment of a BAVM associated with an IA are to prevent hemorrhage, avoid stepwise neurological deterioration, and eliminate the mortality risk associated with recurrent hemorrhagic events. The treatment is only justifiable if the risks associated with an intervention are lower than or equivalent to the long-term risks of disability or mortality caused by the lesion itself. When faced with this difficult decision, a few questions need to be answered by the treating neu-rosurgeon: What is the mode of presentation? What is the symptomatic lesion? Which one of the lesions bled? What is the relationship between the BAVM and IA? Is it possible to safely treat both BAVM and IA? The objective of this review is to discuss the demographics, natural history, classification, and strategies for management of BAVMs associated with IAs.",2014 Sep,2014,Neurosurgical focus,37,3,E11,eng,False,10.3171/2014.6.FOCUS14165;10.3171/2014.6.FOCUS14165,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Cerebral Angiography;*Disease Management;*Endovascular Procedures;Female;Humans;*Intracranial Aneurysm/complications/epidemiology/surgery;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/epidemiology/surgery;Intracranial Hemorrhages/etiology;Male;*Microsurgery;Middle Aged;Retrospective Studies;Risk Factors;Tomography, X-Ray Computed",ARUBA = A Randomized Trial of Unruptured Arteriovenous Malformations;AVM = arteriovenous malformation;BAVM = brain AVM;IA = intracranial aneurysm;IVH = intraventricular hemorrhage;NPPB = normal perfusion pressure breakthrough;SRS = stereotactic radiosurgery;brain arteriovenous malformation;flow-related aneurysm;intranidal aneurysm;management strategies;review
24983727,Endovascular transarterial embolization of cerebral arteriovenous malformation with ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer.,"Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) have an estimated 2-4% annual risk of hemorrhage. Treatment options for AVMs include microsurgical resection, stereotactic radiosurgery, and endovascular embolization. As endovascular technology and techniques continue to advance and mature, endovascular embolization is becoming an increasingly vital component of AVM treatment not only as a presurgical treatment to reduce microsurgical risks, but also as a stand-alone curative method in some cases. This case illustrates the successful and curative transarterial embolization of a right frontal AVM in a 17-year-old boy with ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer (Onyx).

26145824,Visual Field Preservation in Surgery of Occipital Arteriovenous Malformations: A Prospective Study.,"OBJECTIVE: We reviewed our prospective study of patients with occipital arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) to assess whether the display of optic radiation diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) during neuronavigation-guided surgery can reduce the severity of postoperative visual field deficits (VFDs) and to evaluate the factors associated with visual field preservation. METHODS: Forty-six consecutive patients with occipital AVMs were randomized in our study. DTI of the optic radiation was displayed during neuronavigation surgery in 24 patients. The other 22 patients were treated surgically without neuronavigation. Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores and visual fields were evaluated preoperatively, immediately after surgery, and at the last follow-up. RESULTS: The patients' baseline characteristics and AVM features were statistically similar between the 2 surgical groups. The postoperative obliteration rate was 100%. The postoperative mRS scores did not differ between the 2 groups (P > 0.05). Preexisting VFDs were more common (P = 0.00004) in patients who bled than in those with unruptured AVMs. The application of DTI-incorporated neuronavigation reduced the frequency and severity of postoperative VFDs (P = 0.013 and 0.001, respectively). Visual fields were more likely to be preserved in patients with an AVM >5 mm from the optic radiation (P = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: A history of hemorrhage is an independent risk factor for VFDs associated with occipital AVMs. Although not showing superiority in postoperative mRS, functional MRI navigation-guided surgery may help to radically resect occipital AVMs and preserve patient visual fields. A 5-mm distance from the optic radiation may be a suitable safety margin for visual field preservation.",2015 Nov,2015,World neurosurgery,84,5,1423-36,eng,False,S1878-8750(15)00817-7;10.1016/j.wneu.2015.06.069;S1878-8750(15)00817-7;10.1016/j.wneu.2015.06.069,"Journal Article;Randomized Controlled Trial;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Adolescent;Adult;Child;Diffusion Tensor Imaging;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Intracranial Hemorrhages/complications;Male;Middle Aged;Neuronavigation;Neurosurgical Procedures/adverse effects/*methods;Occipital Lobe/*surgery;Postoperative Complications/*epidemiology/physiopathology/prevention & control;Prognosis;Prospective Studies;Risk Factors;Treatment Outcome;Visual Field Tests;Visual Fields/*physiology;Young Adult,Arteriovenous malformation;Diffusion tensor imaging;Functional MRI;Microsurgery;Neuronavigation;Visual field deficits
16611106,Endovascular treatment of pulmonary and cerebral arteriovenous malformations in patients affected by hereditary haemorrhagic teleangiectasia.,"Hereditary Haemorrhagic Teleangiectasia (HHT) is a vascular disorder of angiogenesis transmitted in an autosomal dominant pattern, characterised by heterogeneity in clinical manifestations. One of the most important organ involved is lung, including pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVM). PAVM occur in 20 to 30% of the HHT population and recently are considered a marker of disease. PAVM are direct artery-to-vein connections with low pressure and without an interveining capillary bed. PAVM are classified as simple (supplied by one feeding artery) or complex (receiving blood supply from two or more feeding artery). According to the international reports, treatment it's recommendable for all PAVM with feeding vessels 3mm or larger, in order to reduce the risk of cerebral ischaemia and neurologic manifestations frequently attributed to paradoxical embolisation. Transcatheter embolotherapy of PAVM is a form of treatment based on occlusion of the feeding artery to a PAVM by using platinum coils or detachable balloons. The technique of coil embolisation involves the exact localisation of PAVM by pulmonary angiography followed by superselective percutaneous caheterisation of feeding artery obtained by using a dedicated 7F guiding catheter, which coaxially allocates a 5F hydrophilic catheter advanced in order to perform both superselective angiography of feeding artery and embolisation itself. Inside the 5F catheter the platinum coils are advanced using a .035'' guide-wire and released until an optimal occlusion of feeding artery is achieved. At the end of the procedure angiographic control is performed in order to verify the occlusion of feeding artery. The use of platinum coils is preferable over detachable balloons when feeding artery are greater than 7 mm in diameter and have irregular anatomical configuration. On the other hand, the principal advantage of using detachable balloons is that the balloon itself can be deflated and repositioned if necessary. Transcatheter embolotherapy is technically safe and clinically effective and may represent the primary choice of treatment in HHT patients. On the other hand the most common complications of this treatment (pleurisy and air embolism) can be prevented by using some tips during the embolisation procedure like ""anchor technique,"" ""scaffold technique"" and ""balloon assisted technique."" Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (CAVM) are present in 10-20% of patients with HHT and multiple in 50% of cases. Cortical surface is the most frequent localisation. Angiography is needed to diagnose all CAVM and to clarify the angioarchitecture of the lesion. In HHT CAVM are usually either micro-AVM, with a nidus not bigger than 1 cm, or small AVM, with a nidus between 1 and 3 cm. Quite frequently there are lesions characterised by arteriovenous fistulas. In the three patterns of CAVM usually found in HHT, small AVM are the most risky for bleeding although the risk is lower than that associated with sporadic ones. It is estimated from 0.38 to 0.69% per year in spite of the general incidence of bleeding in sporadic CAVM that ranges from 2 to 4% per year. In HHT patients, at present, the precise indications and timing of treatment are not established. Trend is to treat small AVM and AVF and to follow-up micro-AVM with MRI and angiography. As for sporadic CAVM, treatment of small AVM is usually referred to stereotactic radiosurgery. Endovascular embolisation is proposable if the lesion is easily reachable by microcatheterism and the position of the microcatheter is safe. Glue is used for embolisation and the technique is briefly discussed.",2006,2006,Current pharmaceutical design,12,10,1243-8,eng,False,10.2174/138161206776361237,Journal Article;Review,"Angiography;Arteriovenous Malformations/etiology/*therapy;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/etiology/*therapy;Pulmonary Circulation/*physiology;Telangiectasia, Hereditary Hemorrhagic/*complications",

27188382,Brain arteriovenous malformations.,"An arteriovenous malformation is a tangle of dysplastic vessels (nidus) fed by arteries and drained by veins without intervening capillaries, forming a high-flow, low-resistance shunt between the arterial and venous systems. Arteriovenous malformations in the brain have a low estimated prevalence but are an important cause of intracerebral haemorrhage in young adults. For previously unruptured malformations, bleeding rates are approximately 1% per year. Once ruptured, the subsequent risk increases fivefold, depending on associated aneurysms, deep locations, deep drainage and increasing age. Recent findings from novel animal models and genetic studies suggest that arteriovenous malformations, which were long considered congenital, arise from aberrant vasculogenesis, genetic mutations and/or angiogenesis after injury. The phenotypical characteristics of arteriovenous malformations differ among age groups, with fistulous lesions in children and nidal lesions in adults. Diagnosis mainly involves imaging techniques, including CT, MRI and angiography. Management includes observation, microsurgical resection, endovascular embolization and stereotactic radiosurgery, alone or in any combination. There is little consensus on how to manage patients with unruptured malformations; recent studies have shown that patients managed medically fared better than those with intervention at short-term follow-up. By contrast, interventional treatment is preferred following a ruptured malformation to prevent rehaemorrhage. Management continues to evolve as new mechanistic discoveries and reliable animal models raise the possibility of developing drugs that might prevent the formation of arteriovenous malformations, induce obliteration and/or stabilize vessels to reduce rupture risk.

However, some cases deteriorate even after non-conservative treatment, and there has been no standard of treatment for this disease so far. In order to build a better treatment strategy, we review literature, present our case and propose an algorithm for managing CPA. METHODS: Following the PRISMA principle, we systemically reviewed literature discussing CPA. A case successfully managed with multi-modal treatment is also illustrated. RESULTS: A total of 23 articles with 74 cases of CPA were found. Thirty-three patients received single-modal management. These 33 cases include 24 receiving endovascular intervention, 7 receiving indirect revascularization, and 2 receiving radiotherapy. Three of the 33 patients deteriorated clinically, and 1 expired. We present a 6-year-old boy with left hemispheric CPA receiving indirect revascularization, followed by 2 consecutive courses of stereotactic radiosurgery targeting arteriovenous shunts in the left basal ganglia and arteriovenous shunts around the olfactory groove. In the follow-up period of more than 4 years, good collateral formation, improved perilesional perfusion, CPA shrinkage, and symptom relief were all achieved. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our literature review and case, we propose an algorithm for the management of CPA and emphasize that multi-modal treatment is necessary for most CPA cases.",2022 Nov,2022,World neurosurgery,167,,e360-e369,eng,False,S1878-8750(22)01109-3;10.1016/j.wneu.2022.08.009;S1878-8750(22)01109-3;10.1016/j.wneu.2022.08.009,Case Reports;Journal Article;Review,Male;Humans;Child;Cerebral Angiography;*Cerebrovascular Disorders/surgery;Brain;Basal Ganglia;Head;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/therapy,Algorithm;Cerebral proliferative angiopathy;Endovascular intervention;Indirect revascularization;Management;Radiotherapy
15574228,Intrinsic arteriovenous malformation of the trigeminal nerve in a patient with trigeminal neuralgia: case report.,"OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Intrinsic arteriovenous malformation (AVM) of the trigeminal nerve is extremely uncommon and may be associated with trigeminal neuralgia. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 55-year-old man experienced severe lightning pain in the second and third divisions of the left trigeminal nerve territory. Vertebral angiography demonstrated an AVM fed by the superior cerebellar artery. Magnetic resonance imaging with three-dimensional spoiled gradient recalled acquisition at steady state revealed an AVM intrinsic to the left trigeminal nerve and a small arterial loop causing compression at the root entry zone of the trigeminal nerve. INTERVENTION: Intraoperative inspection revealed an indentation of the root entry zone caused by a small arterial loop but not by the AVM. The offending artery was displaced to decompress the root entry zone using a prosthesis without resection of the AVM. The patient was relieved of the neuralgia immediately after surgery without further neurological deficit. He has been free of trigeminal neuralgia during a follow-up period of 2 years and is scheduled to undergo stereotactic radiosurgery for the treatment of the AVM. CONCLUSION: Intrinsic AVM of the trigeminal nerve may cause trigeminal neuralgia. However, as in the present case, a coexistent vascular lesion rather than the intrinsic AVM could be a cause of the neuralgia.",2004 Dec,2004,Neurosurgery,55,6,1433,eng,False,,Case Reports;Journal Article,Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/*diagnosis;Male;Middle Aged;Trigeminal Nerve/*blood supply;Trigeminal Neuralgia/*complications,
25739432,Endovascular embolization of brain arteriovenous malformations with Eudragit-E.,"Eudragit-E was originally developed as a non-adhesive liquid embolic material in the late 1990s and is a copolymer of methyl and butyl methacrylate and dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate that is dissolved in ethanol and iopamidol. This material has been used for endovascular embolization of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) for some time but is currently not widely used. Because safety and feasibility of Eudragit-E has not been well documented, we here report our experience using this material for treating 22 human brain AVMs. From June 1998 to February 2014, 30 endovascular procedures using Eudragit-E were performed to treat 22 patients, including 14 men and 8 women with a mean age of 41.1 years (15-70 years). The mean follow-up period was 56 months (12-129 months), and the Spetzler-Martin grades were I (4 patients), II (9 patients), III (5 patients), and IV (4 patients). Residual AVMs were treated with stereotactic radiosurgery or surgery. The rate of complete obliteration with embolization alone was 27.3%. The overall obliteration rate after endovascular embolization with/without subsequent stereotactic radiosurgery or surgery was 72.7%. Eudragit-E caused two cases of cerebral infarction. One case of intracerebral hemorrhage due to postoperative hemodynamic changes also occurred. The rate of complications directly related to embolization was 10.0%. The safety and effectiveness of Eudragit-E embolization were satisfactory.",2015,2015,Neurologia medico-chirurgica,55,3,253-60,eng,False,10.2176/nmc.oa.2014-0287;nmc-55-253;10.2176/nmc.oa.2014-0287,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;*Embolization, Therapeutic;*Endovascular Procedures;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/*therapy;Male;Methylmethacrylates/*therapeutic use;Middle Aged;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",

A provocative test may be beneficial in some cases to protect against ischemic complications. We report the case of a 57-year-old man who developed an intracerebral hematoma in the left internal temporal lobe and who had an AVM with a varix in the ambient cistern, which was primarily fed by a branch of the left anterior choroidal artery (AChA) and the posterior lateral choroidal artery, and drained into the basal vein. Therefore, we planned endovascular obliteration of the AChA, followed by gamma knife radiosurgery for the residual posterior component. The patient underwent a superselective provocative test with a 3 mg of propofol under general anesthesia using motor-evoked potential monitoring. The feeder embolization was performed as planned after the provocative test, and the patient exhibited no neurological deficits, such as hemiparesis, during the procedure.",2016 Sep,2016,Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National,25,9,e153-7,eng,False,S1052-3057(16)30112-4;10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2016.05.034;S1052-3057(16)30112-4;10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2016.05.034,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Cerebral Angiography;Endovascular Procedures/*methods;Evoked Potentials, Motor/*drug effects/physiology;Humans;Hypnotics and Sedatives/*pharmacology;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Propofol/*pharmacology",Motor-evoked potentials;cerebral arteriovenous malformations;embolization;superselective provocative test
18786684,[Unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations].,"Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) often become symptomatic in young adults with a variety of neurological symptoms such as epileptic seizures, recurrent headaches, progressive neurological deficits or sudden intracranial hemorrhage. However, recent epidemiological data suggest a large number of AVMs are found without signs of hemorrhage and a relatively low rupture risk of less than 1% per year. Continuous technical progress has led to several specific treatment options for brain AVMs including endovascular embolization, microneurosurgery, and stereotactic radiotherapy, either alone or in any combination. Depending on AVM topography and vascular anatomy, interventional treatment strategies have shown successful occlusion rates ranging between 50 and 100% and a relatively low average procedural morbidity of 10% overall. For unruptured brain AVMs, however, the clinical benefit of invasive treatment remains as yet to be determined. To address this issue, A randomized trial of unruptured brain AVMs (ARUBA) is currently underway evaluating long-term outcome of best possible standard interventional therapy as compared to the natural history risk in a prospective multidisciplinary international study (www.arubastudy.org).",2008 Oct,2008,Revue neurologique,164,10,787-92,fre,False,10.1016/j.neurol.2008.07.017;S0035-3787(08)00472-4;10.1016/j.neurol.2008.07.017,English Abstract;Journal Article;Review,"Adult;Central Nervous System Vascular;Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology;Embolization, Therapeutic;Humans;Neurosurgical Procedures;Radiosurgery",
12963503,Arteriovenous malformations of the cerebral circulation that rupture in pregnancy.,"Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) have a poorly defined natural history, more so in the pregnant population. Presentation during the pregnancy is usually as a result of haemorrhage following rupture. Whether pregnancy alters the natural tendency to rupture remains controversial, but empirical data suggest that this is the case. The most important complication following rupture in pregnancy is the possibility of a subsequent re-haemorrhage. In those patients with high operative risk or inoperable lesions, a conservative management course should be adopted during the pregnancy allowing stereotactic radiosurgery or embolisation options to be pursued after delivery (see Management algorithm). Precautions during labour are recommended, biased towards caesarean section. In those patients in whom a lesion is deemed operable (low risk), surgery may improve the risks of poor outcome provided treatment risks are low. Factors such as AVM morphology, local expertise and support facilities (including those for endovascular therapy) are essential considerations if outcome is to improve on the natural history of the condition. Preoperative endovascular embolisation can be included when considering surgical excision.",2003 Sep,2003,Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology : the journal of the Institute of,23,5,484-9,eng,False,KF4GUJ51RB2AABYX;10.1080/0144361031000153684,Journal Article;Review,"Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology;Female;Humans;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/therapy;Pregnancy;*Pregnancy Complications, Cardiovascular/diagnosis/therapy;Rupture, Spontaneous;Subarachnoid Hemorrhage/etiology",
18518718,Venous-predominant parenchymal arteriovenous malformation: a rare subtype with a venous drainage pattern mimicking developmental venous anomaly.,"OBJECT: Considerable confusion exists in the literature regarding the classification of cerebrovascular malformations and their clinical significance. One example is provided by the atypical developmental venous anomaly (DVA) with arteriovenous shunt, because it remains controversial whether these lesions should be classified as DVAs or as atypical cases of other subtypes of cerebrovascular malformations. The purpose of this study was to clarify the classification of these challenging vascular lesions in an effort to suggest an appropriate diagnosis and management strategy. METHODS: The authors present a series of 15 patients with intracranial vascular malformations that were angiographically classified as atypical DVAs with arteriovenous shunts. This type of vascular malformation shows a fine arterial blush without a distinct nidus and early filling of dilated medullary veins that drain these arterial components during the arterial phase on angiography. Those prominent medullary veins converge toward an enlarged main draining vein, which together form the caput medusae appearance of a typical DVA. RESULTS: Based on clinical, angiographic, surgical, and histological findings, the authors propose classifying these vascular malformations as a subtype of an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), rather than as a variant of DVA or as a combined vascular malformation. CONCLUSIONS: Correct recognition of this AVM subtype is required for its proper management, and its clinical behavior appears to follow that of a typical AVM.

Despite numerous retrospective studies, only one randomized controlled trial has been conducted, comparing the role of medical management alone to medical management plus surgical and/or radiosurgical intervention in patients with unruptured AVMs: A Randomized Trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformations (ARUBA). To great controversy, ARUBA concluded that medical management alone was superior to intervention for unruptured AVMs, which was subsequently challenged by various single-institution and multi-center studies analyzing outcomes of ARUBA-eligible patients. This review summarizes studies returned from a PubMed database search querying, 'ARUBA,' 'ARUBA-eligible,' 'surgery unruptured AVM,' and ""radiosurgery unruptured AVM"". The rates of the primary endpoint of symptomatic stroke or death were low among the analyzed studies (0-12.2%, mean 8.0%) and similar to the medically managed arm of ARUBA (10.1%). Likewise, the percentage of patients with impaired functional outcomes (modified Rankin score ≥2) in the reviewed studies was low (5.9%-13.1%; mean: 9.9%) and comparable to the 14.0% observed in the medically management arm of ARUBA.

CASE REPORT: A 32-year-old woman with an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) located in the primary motor cortex underwent surgery using functional neuronavigation. Blood-oxygenation-level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI) and diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) were used for preoperative mapping of primary motor areas and the corticospinal tracts, respectively. The BOLD fMRI activations and DTT tractograms were integrated into the neuronavigation system and visualized intraoperatively throughout the operation. Furthermore, stereoscopic visualizations of the angioarchitecture based on 3D MRI angiograms were used to rehearse the surgical approach to the feeder vessels. Finally, intraoperative ultrasound was used to locate and clip the feeding vessels. CONCLUSION: The AVM was carefully resected with the aid of the above-mentioned imaging techniques, and the intuitive usefulness of the techniques was further substantiated by the rewarding postoperative outcome.",2009 Apr,2009,Minimally invasive neurosurgery : MIN,52,2,83-5,eng,False,10.1055/s-0028-1124104;10.1055/s-0028-1124104,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Adult;Brain Mapping/methods;Cerebral Arteries/diagnostic imaging/pathology/surgery;Cerebral Veins/diagnostic imaging/pathology/surgery;Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*pathology/*surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods;Monitoring, Intraoperative/methods;Motor Cortex/*pathology/*surgery;Neuronavigation/*methods;Neurosurgical Procedures/instrumentation/methods;Postoperative Complications/etiology/prevention & control;Preoperative Care/*methods;Pyramidal Tracts/anatomy & histology/surgery;Surgical Instruments;Treatment Outcome;Ultrasonography;Vascular Surgical Procedures/instrumentation/methods",
30165208,The Real Impact of an Intraoperative Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Equipped Operative Theatre in Neurovascular Surgery: The Sapienza University Experience.,"The fundamental role of technological instruments in contemporary Neurosurgery is undisputed, and intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) represents one of the best examples. The use of a modern high-field magnet and the possibility to match the MRI with an operative microscope and an integrated neuronavigation system has led to successful results in the surgical treatment of different diseases. At our institute, we have performed surgery routinely with the aid of intraoperative MRI over the last 15 years. The aim of this article is to report our experience in the management of neurovascular lesions with the use of this device. We experienced that intraoperative MRI enhanced the surgical experience, leading to an improved postoperative outcome in the treatment of different lesions, such as arteriovenous malformations, dural arteriovenous fistulas, intracranial cavernous angiomas, and intracranial aneurysms. There are several advantages provided by the use of intraoperative MRI. The use of intraoperative MRI coupled with the planning station and the neuronavigation system allows one to obtain preoperative 3-dimensional reconstructions of the vessels, which aids the definition of the anatomy of each neurovascular lesion. Furthermore, the possibility performing an intraoperative scan allows a comparison with preoperative images and, subsequently, the updating of the surgical strategy. Intraoperative diffusion-weighted imaging can detect possible territorial ischemia that would be amenable to intensive treatment. Although increased costs, increased surgical times, increased anesthesiology times, and the possible increased risk of surgical infection may represent some major limitation, the use of intraoperative MRI-equipped operative theaters with integrated neuronavigation systems can prove extremely helpful in the management of neurovascular conditions.",2018 Dec,2018,World neurosurgery,120,,190-199,eng,False,S1878-8750(18)31907-7;10.1016/j.wneu.2018.08.124;S1878-8750(18)31907-7;10.1016/j.wneu.2018.08.124,Journal Article;Review,"Brain Ischemia/diagnostic imaging/surgery;Central Nervous System Vascular Malformations/diagnostic imaging/surgery;Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging/instrumentation;Equipment Design;Hemangioma, Cavernous, Central Nervous System/diagnostic imaging/surgery;Hospitals, University;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional/instrumentation;Intracranial Aneurysm/diagnostic imaging/surgery;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Intraoperative Period;*Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Neuronavigation/*instrumentation;*Operating Rooms;*Surgical Equipment",AVMs;Brain aneurysms;Cavernous angiomas;DAVFs;Intraoperative MRI

32015188,Overview of the current concepts in the management of arteriovenous malformations of the brain.,"BACKGROUND: There is a lack of consensus in the management of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the brain since ARUBA (A Randomised trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous malformations) trial showed that medical management is superior to interventional therapy in patients with unruptured brain AVMs. The treatment of brain AVM is associated with significant morbidity. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: A review was done to determine the behaviour of brain AVMs and analyse the risks and benefits of the available treatment options. A search was done in the literature for studies on brain AVMs. Descriptive analysis was also done. RESULTS: The angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor and inflammatory cytokines are involved in the growth of AVMs. Proteinases such as matrix metalloproteinase-9 contribute to the weakening and rupture of the nidus. The risk factors for haemorrhage are prior haemorrhage, deep and infratentorial AVM location, exclusive deep venous drainage and associated aneurysms. The advancements in operating microscope and surgical techniques have facilitated microsurgery. Stereotactic radiosurgery causes progressive vessel obliteration over 2-3 years. Endovascular embolisation can be done prior to microsurgery or radiosurgery and for palliation. CONCLUSIONS: Spetzler-Martin grades I and II have low surgical risks. The AVMs located in the cerebellum, subarachnoid cisterns and pial surfaces of the brainstem can be treated surgically. Radiosurgery is preferable for deep-seated AVMs. A combination of microsurgery, embolisation and radiosurgery is recommended for deep-seated and Spetzler-Martin grade III AVMs. Observation is recommended for grades IV and V.",2020 Apr,2020,Postgraduate medical journal,96,1134,212-220,eng,False,10.1136/postgradmedj-2019-137202;postgradmedj-2019-137202;10.1136/postgradmedj-2019-137202,Journal Article;Review,Conservative Treatment/*methods;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*therapy;Neurosurgical Procedures/*methods;Risk Adjustment,epilepsy;neuropathology;neurosurgery;stroke;vascular medicine;vascular surgery
31503327,Interventions for treating brain arteriovenous malformations in adults.,"BACKGROUND: Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are the single most common cause of intracerebral haemorrhage in young adults. Brain AVMs also cause seizure(s) and focal neurological deficits (in the absence of haemorrhage, migraine or an epileptic seizure); approximately one-fifth are incidental discoveries. Various interventions are used in an attempt to eradicate brain AVMs: neurosurgical excision, stereotactic radiosurgery, endovascular embolization, and staged combinations of these interventions. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2006, and last updated in 2009. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness and safety of the different interventions, alone or in combination, for treating brain AVMs in adults compared against either each other, or conservative management, in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane Stroke Group Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched 7 January 2019), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 1) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE Ovid (1980 to 14 January 2019), and Embase OVID (1980 to 14 January 2019). We searched international registers of clinical trials, the contents pages of relevant journals, and bibliographies of relevant articles (November 2009). We also contacted manufacturers of interventional treatments for brain AVMs (March 2005). SELECTION CRITERIA: We sought RCTs of any intervention for brain AVMs (used alone or in combination), compared against each other or against conservative management, with relevant clinical outcome measures. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: One author screened the results of the updated searches for potentially eligible RCTs for this updated review. Both authors independently read the potentially eligible RCTs in full and confirmed their inclusion according to the inclusion criteria. We resolved disagreement by discussion. We assessed the risk of bias in included studies and applied GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: We included one trial with 226 participants: A Randomized trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformations (ARUBA), comparing intervention versus conservative management for unruptured brain AVMs (that had never bled). The quality of evidence was moderate because we found just one trial that was at low risk of bias other than a high risk of performance bias due to participants and treating physicians not being blinded to allocated treatment. Data on functional outcome and death at a follow-up of 12 months were provided for 218 (96%) of the participants in ARUBA. In this randomized controlled trial (RCT), intervention compared to conservative management increased death or dependency (modified Rankin Scale score ≥ 2, risk ratio (RR) 2.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28 to 4.98; 1 trial, 226 participants; moderate-quality evidence) and the proportion of participants with symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (RR 6.75, 95% CI 2.07 to 21.96; 1 trial, 226 participants; moderate-quality evidence), but there was no difference in the frequency of epileptic seizures (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.06; 1 trial, 226 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Three RCTs are ongoing. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found moderate-quality evidence from one RCT including adults with unruptured brain AVMs that conservative management was superior to intervention with respect to functional outcome and symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage over one year after randomization.

34129969,Management of Acute Hemorrhage Caused by Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformation During Pregnancy-Case Series and Literature Review.,"OBJECTIVE: Acute hemorrhage caused by cerebral arteriovenous malformation (cAVM) during pregnancy is uncommon but life-threatening for both mother and fetus and presents a great challenge to clinical management. However, there is still no consensus on the treatment strategy and the treatment timing of acute hemorrhage from cAVM during pregnancy. The aim of this study was to amalgamate reported case series and our cases regarding the clinical management of pregnant patients under this special condition. METHODS: We report a case series of 3 pregnant patients with acute hemorrhage caused by cAVM in our hospital. A systematic PubMed search of the English-language literature published between 1970 and 2020 was carried out. Clinical information including patients' age, gestational age, imaging studies, treatment strategy, treatment timing, delivery mode, and outcomes were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: The rebleed rate is about 7.1% and the mortality from rebleeding is up to 25%. Treatment modalities included radical surgery, endovascular embolization, radiosurgery/stereotactic radiosurgery, palliative surgery, and conservative treatment. There were no maternal deaths in either the intrapartum intervention group and the postpartum intervention subgroup of gestational age <34 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: A high rebleed rate and high mortality from rebleeding indicate that the intervention of ruptured cAVM should not be delayed. Intervention of ruptured cAVM within 2 weeks after initial hemorrhage is advisable in patients at gestational age <34 weeks, whereas termination of pregnancy as soon as possible followed by timely intervention of ruptured cAVM is practicable in patients at gestational age ≥34 weeks.",2021 Aug,2021,World neurosurgery,152,,e688-e699,eng,False,S1878-8750(21)00827-5;10.1016/j.wneu.2021.06.002;S1878-8750(21)00827-5;10.1016/j.wneu.2021.06.002,Case Reports;Journal Article;Review,"Adult;Arteriovenous Fistula/complications/*therapy;Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology/therapy;Embolization, Therapeutic/methods;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/*therapy;Pregnancy;Pregnancy Complications/*therapy",Cerebral arteriovenous malformation;Pregnancy;Treatment strategy;Treatment timing
32442730,Changes in Clinical Presentation and Treatment Over Time in Patients with Unruptured Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations.,"OBJECTIVE: Treatment of unruptured intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) has become controversial since the ARUBA (A Randomized Trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformations) study was published in 2014. We sought to analyze changes in the demographics, clinical presentation, and treatment strategies in 2 patient cohorts from the same institution separated by 40 years. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the electronic medical records for a consecutive series of patients with unruptured intracranial AVMs seen at the Mayo Clinic between 2003 and 2017 and compared them with a previously published historical cohort from the same institution seen between 1974 and 1985. RESULTS: There were 273 patients in the contemporary cohort, of which discovery of the AVM was incidental in 123 (45.1%), a 3.5-fold increase compared with the 13.1% out of 168 patients in the historical cohort (P < 0.0001). Consequently, the percentage of patients with seizures as the presenting symptom leading to the diagnosis of AVM decreased from 57.7% in the historical cohort to 28.9% in the contemporary cohort (P < 0.0001). Interventional treatment was utilized in 220 (81.5%) contemporary patients compared with 49 (29.2%) historical patients (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to 40 years ago, more patients are presenting with incidentally discovered intracranial AVMs and are undergoing interventional treatment.

38714978,A comprehensive analysis of patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformation with headache: assessment of risk factors and treatment effectiveness.,"BACKGROUND: Due to the high mortality and disability rate of intracranial hemorrhage, headache is not the main focus of research on cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM), so research on headaches in AVM is still scarce, and the clinical understanding is shallow. This study aims to delineate the risk factors associated with headaches in AVM and to compare the effectiveness of various intervention treatments versus conservative treatment in alleviating headache symptoms. METHODS: This study conducted a retrospective analysis of AVMs who were treated in our institution from August 2011 to December 2021. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was employed to assess the risk factors for headaches in AVMs with unruptured, non-epileptic. Additionally, the effectiveness of different intervention treatments compared to conservative management in alleviating headaches was evaluated through propensity score matching (PSM). RESULTS: A total of 946 patients were included in the analysis of risk factors for headaches. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified that female (OR 1.532, 95% CI 1.173-2.001, p = 0.002), supply artery dilatation (OR 1.423, 95% CI 1.082-1.872, p = 0.012), and occipital lobe (OR 1.785, 95% CI 1.307-2.439, p < 0.001) as independent risk factors for the occurrence of headaches. There were 443 AVMs with headache symptoms. After propensity score matching, the microsurgery group (OR 7.27, 95% CI 2.82-18.7 p < 0.001), stereotactic radiosurgery group(OR 9.46, 95% CI 2.26-39.6, p = 0.002), and multimodality treatment group (OR 8.34 95% CI 2.87-24.3, p < 0.001) demonstrate significant headache relief compared to the conservative group. However, there was no significant difference between the embolization group (OR 2.24 95% CI 0.88-5.69, p = 0.091) and the conservative group. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified potential risk factors for headaches in AVMs and found that microsurgery, stereotactic radiosurgery, and multimodal therapy had significant benefits in headache relief compared to conservative treatment. These findings provide important guidance for clinicians when developing treatment options that can help improve overall treatment outcomes and quality of life for patients.",2024 May 7,2024,The journal of headache and pain,25,1,72,eng,False,10.1186/s10194-024-01774-7;72;10.1186/s10194-024-01774-7;1774;10.1186/s10194-024-01774-7,Journal Article,"Humans;Female;*Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/therapy;Male;*Headache/etiology/therapy;Adult;Retrospective Studies;Risk Factors;Middle Aged;Young Adult;Conservative Treatment/methods;Treatment Outcome;Embolization, Therapeutic/methods;Adolescent",Arteriovenous malformation;Conservative treatment;Headache;Intervention treatments
11334299,Cerebral arteriovenous malformations: comparison of novel magnetic resonance angiographic techniques and conventional catheter angiography.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential of novel magnetic resonance (MR) angiographic techniques for the assessment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations. METHODS: Forty patients who were about to undergo stereotactic radiosurgery were prospectively recruited. Three-dimensional, sliding-slab interleaved ky (SLINKY), time-of-flight acquisition was performed, as was a dynamic MR digital subtraction angiography (DSA) procedure in which single thick slices (6-10 cm) were obtained using a radiofrequency spoiled Fourier-acquired steady-state sequence (1 image/s). Sixty images were acquired, in two or three projections, during passage of a 6- to 10-ml bolus of gadolinium chelate. Subtraction and postprocessing were performed, and images were viewed in an inverted cine mode. SLINKY time-of-flight acquisition was repeated after the administration of gadolinium. Routine stereotactic conventional catheter angiography was performed after MR imaging. All images were assessed (in a blinded randomized manner) for Spetzler-Martin grading and determination of associated vascular pathological features. RESULTS: Forty-one arteriovenous malformations were assessed in 40 patients. Contrast-enhanced (CE) SLINKY MR angiography was the most consistent MR imaging technique, yielding a 95% correlation with the Spetzler-Martin classification defined by conventional catheter angiography; MR DSA exhibited 90% agreement, and SLINKY MR angiography exhibited 81% agreement. CE SLINKY MR angiography provided improved nidus delineation, compared with non-CE SLINKY MR angiography. Dynamic information from MR DSA significantly improved the observation of early-draining veins and associated aneurysms. CONCLUSION: CE SLINKY MR angiographic assessment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations offers significant advantages, compared with the use of non-CE SLINKY MR angiography, including improved nidus demonstration. MR DSA shows promise as a noninvasive method for dynamic angiography but is presently restricted by limitations in both temporal and spatial resolution.",2001 May,2001,Neurosurgery,48,5,973-82; discussion 982-3,eng,False,,Comparative Study;Evaluation Study;Journal Article,"Adult;Aged;Angiography, Digital Subtraction/standards;*Cerebral Angiography/standards;Cerebral Veins/diagnostic imaging/pathology;Female;Humans;Intracranial Aneurysm/complications;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/classification/complications/*diagnosis;Magnetic Resonance Angiography/*methods/standards;Male;Middle Aged;Phlebography/standards",
31434094,Effect of A Randomized trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformation on Interventional Treatment Rates for Unruptured Arteriovenous Malformations.,"BACKGROUND: In 2013, investigators from A Randomized Trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformations (AVM; ARUBA) reported that interventions to obliterate unruptured AVMs caused more morbidity and mortality than medical management. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether interventions for unruptured AVM decreased after publication of ARUBA results. METHODS: We used the Nationwide Readmissions Database to assess trends in interventional AVM management in patients ≥18 years of age from 2010 through 2015. Unruptured brain AVMs were identified using International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code 747.81 and excluding any patient with a diagnosis of intracranial hemorrhage. Our primary outcome was interventional AVM treatment, identified using ICD-9-CM procedure codes for surgical resection, endovascular therapy, and stereotactic radiosurgery. Join-point regression was used to assess trends in the incidence of interventional AVM management among adults from 2010 through 2015. RESULTS: There was no significant U.S. population level change in unruptured brain AVM intervention rates before versus after ARUBA (p = 0.59), with the incidence of AVM intervention ranging from 8.0 to 9.2 per 10 million U.S. residents before the trial publication to 7.7-8.3 per 10 million afterwards.

30107248,"Management of Concomitant Moyamoya Disease, Arterial Venous Malformation, and Intracranial Aneurysm: Case Illustration, Literature Review, and Management Algorithm.","BACKGROUND: Moyamoya disease (MMD), arterial venous malformations (AVMs), and intracranial aneurysms are distinct cerebrovascular disease processes that most commonly occur in isolation. The literature on the treatment algorithm of each individual condition is well established. An association between MMD and intracranial aneurysms is also known, but MMD in association with AVM is rare. CASE DESCRIPTIONS: The authors discuss various dilemmas in the multimodality management of these conditions when they coexist with an illustrative case of a 46-year-old woman who presented following a stroke, with 1) left-sided MMD, 2) left-sided frontal AVM, and 3) an aneurysm arising from the A1 segment of the right anterior cerebral artery. These were managed respectively by 1) the left external carotid artery to M2 segment of middle cerebral artery bypass using an autologous radial artery graft and left indirect superior temporal artery-encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis, 2) stereotactic radiosurgery, and 3) endovascular coiling of the aneurysm. Three years following intervention, cerebral angiography showed a patent bypass, complete obliteration of the AVM, and no residual filling of the coiled aneurysm. CONCLUSIONS: Our strategy of surgical revascularization for MMD, radiosurgery for AVM, and endovascular coiling for aneurysm resulted in a positive long-term clinical outcome.

11956940,Versatile intraoperative MRI in neurosurgery and radiology.,"BACKGROUND: Several models for the application of intra-operative magnetic resonance imaging (IMRI) have recently been reported, most of them unique. Two fundamental issues need to be addressed: optimal use of the scanner to ensure a wide base for research, development and clinical application, and an organisational model that facilitates such use. METHOD: While in our setting the IMRI project was initiated by the neurosurgeons, the need for wider use of the facilities was recognised since the beginning of the planning phase in 1996. An organisational model was developed that allowed for development of neurosurgical applications, radiological imaging, and radiological interventions and for the research and development work of the vendor. A resistive 0.23 T MR scanner was installed in a dedicated operating room environment. Unique to this scanner is the ability to turn off the magnet, allowing for normal OR activities and devices, and to turn on the magnet as needed with a relatively short six-minute ramp up time. A staged surgical technique was perfected, allowing for transfer of data to the neuronavigator outside the scanner during surgery. In neurosurgery, IMRI was used as one part of a neuronavigational system that included ultrasound imaging, intra-operative cortical stimulation during awake procedures, electrocorticography and two neuronavigators. FINDINGS: 34 neurosurgical cases included 27 brain tumour resections, 5 brain tumour biopsies, 1 extirpation of an arterio-venous malformation, and 1 haematoma evacuation. The scanner could also be used for normal clinical imaging where obese patients, children, claustophobic patients and postoperative control examinations were the major groups. The radiologists performed 110 interventions, including bone and abdominal biopsies, nerve root infiltrations and local pain therapies, with the optical needle tracking system under continuous MRI guidance. The organisational model allowed frequent use of the facilities for both neurosurgery and radiology and continuous development of the facilities. Intra-operative ultrasound was used in 20 tumour resections and in two open brain biopsies. This resulted in reduction of the number of MR imaging sessions during surgery. Five of the 27 resections were performed as awake craniotomies with cortical stimulation. For two of the resections, electrocorticography and depth electrode registrations were used. Furthermore, various non-MRI-compatible instruments and devices were used. INTERPRETATION: Intra-operative MRI is an imaging tool that can be useful especially in the context of neuronavigation. A scanner that can be turned off during surgery is particularly appropriate for neurosurgery. The concept of joint use of such facilities with other clinicians is mutually worthwhile.",2002 Mar,2002,Acta neurochirurgica,144,3,271-8; discussion 278,eng,False,10.1007/s007010200035,Journal Article,"Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Biopsy/instrumentation;Brain/pathology/surgery;Brain Diseases/diagnosis/*surgery;Brain Neoplasms/pathology/surgery;Cerebral Hemorrhage/surgery;Equipment Design;Female;Finland;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*instrumentation;Male;Middle Aged;Monitoring, Intraoperative/*instrumentation;Neuronavigation/*instrumentation;Operating Rooms/organization & administration;Patient Care Team",
28054837,Radiosurgery Alters the Endothelial Surface Proteome: Externalized Intracellular Molecules as Potential Vascular Targets in Irradiated Brain Arteriovenous Malformations.,"Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is an established treatment for brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) that drives blood vessel closure through cellular proliferation, thrombosis and fibrosis, but is limited by a delay to occlusion of 2-3 years and a maximum treatable size of 3 cm. In this current study we used SRS as a priming tool to elicit novel protein expression on the endothelium of irradiated AVM vessels, and these proteins were then targeted with prothrombotic conjugates to induce rapid thrombosis and vessel closure. SRS-induced protein changes on the endothelium in an animal model of AVM were examined using in vivo biotin labeling of surface-accessible proteins and comparative proteomics. LC-MS/MS using SWATH acquisition label-free mass spectrometry identified 280 proteins in biotin-enriched fractions. The abundance of 56 proteins increased after irradiation of the rat arteriovenous fistula (20 Gy, ≥1.5-fold). A large proportion of intracellular proteins were present in this subset: 29 mitochondrial and 9 cytoskeletal. Three of these proteins were chosen for further validation based on previously published evidence for surface localization and a role in autoimmune stimulation: cardiac troponin I (TNNI3); manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2); and the E2 subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDCE2). Immunostaining of AVM vessels confirmed an increase in abundance of PDCE2 across the vessel wall, but not a measurable increase in TNNI3 or SOD2. All three proteins co-localized with the endothelium after irradiation, however, more detailed subcellular distribution could not be accurately established. In vitro, radiation-stimulated surface translocation of all three proteins was confirmed in nonpermeabilized brain endothelial cells using immunocytochemistry. Total protein abundance increased modestly after irradiation for PDCE2 and SOD2 but decreased for TNNI3, suggesting that radiation primarily affects subcellular distribution rather than protein levels. The novel identification of these proteins as surface exposed in response to radiation raises important questions about their potential role in radiation-induced inflammation, fibrosis and autoimmunity, but may also provide unique candidates for vascular targeting in brain AVMs and other vascular tissues.",2017 Jan,2017,Radiation research,187,1,66-78,eng,False,10.1667/RR14518.1;10.1667/RR14518.1,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Animals;Arteriovenous Malformations/*metabolism/pathology/*radiotherapy;Brain/*pathology/radiation effects;Cell Line;Endothelial Cells/metabolism/*radiation effects;Intracellular Space/metabolism/*radiation effects;Male;Protein Transport/radiation effects;Proteome/*metabolism;*Radiosurgery;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley",
11807652,Multiple arteriovenous malformations with hemorrhage.,"BACKGROUND: A rare case of a left temporal arteriovenous malformation (AVM) with bleeding 10 days after removal of another hemorrhagic AVM in the frontal lobe is reported. METHOD: A 47-year-old man had an attack of headache and vomiting and was admitted to our hospital. On admission, a CT scan showed subcortical hemorrhage in the left frontal lobe. Left carotid angiography revealed four AVMs and a vertebro-basilar angiogram demonstrated a vascular malformation. FINDINGS: First, a hemorrhagic AVM was removed with a hematoma. Following the operation, left carotid angiograms continued to show, AVMs, particularly a temporal AVM with increased blood flow, and after 10 days this hemorrhaged. This was surgically resected and the remaining small AVMs were treated by stereotactic radiosurgery. INTERPRETATION: The patient had a high risk of hemorrhage. Adding hemodynamic stress to this situation, hemorrhage would have been expected to occur at an early time after the initial intervention for hemorrhagic AVM. Considering the risk of hemorrhage, other AVMs should undergo surgery as soon as possible after resection of hemorrhagic AVM.",2002 Jan,2002,Acta neurochirurgica,144,1,97-101,eng,False,10.1007/s701-002-8279-0,Case Reports;Journal Article,Cerebral Angiography;Cerebral Hemorrhage/*etiology/pathology;Frontal Lobe/*pathology;Hemodynamics;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/*pathology/surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Risk Factors;Temporal Lobe/pathology,
30735875,Curative Embolization of Arteriovenous Malformations.,"Arteriovenous malformations have a significant cumulative risk for hemorrhage. Treatment options include observation, microsurgical resection, stereotactic radiosurgery, embolization, and multimodal treatment. Treatment selection and timing are based on arteriovenous malformation (AVM) features including size, location in eloquent versus noneloquent parenchyma, pattern of venous drainage, surgical access, rupture status, and previous treatments. Spetzler-Martin grading is the most commonly used classification system used to select treatment, with grades I and II lesions amenable to surgical resection alone, grade III lesions typically treated via a multimodal approach entailing preoperative embolization followed by microsurgical resection, and grades IV and V lesions generally observed unless ruptured. Embolization in the treatment of AVMs is thus most commonly used as a preoperative or, occasionally, preradiosurgical adjunct. The concept of curative AVM embolization is an attractive one that has emerged within the past few decades, with increasing clinical evidence for its safety and efficacy in recent years. Obliteration rates for curative AVM embolization will be improved by innovation in endovascular techniques and technologies.",2019 Sep,2019,World neurosurgery,129,,467-486,eng,False,S1878-8750(19)30266-9;10.1016/j.wneu.2019.01.166;S1878-8750(19)30266-9;10.1016/j.wneu.2019.01.166,Journal Article;Review,"Arteriovenous Fistula/*therapy;Embolization, Therapeutic/*methods;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*therapy",AVMs;Arteriovenous malformations;Curative;Embolization;Spetzler-Martin;Transarterial;Transvenous
29582977,Surgical technique and nuances in ruptured versus unruptured arteriovenous malformation surgery.,"Because of the more frequent use of noninvasive imaging methods, arteriovenous malformation (AVM) are gaining more attention. Population based studies reveal that about 35% to 50% of patients with AVM initially present with hemorrhage. Prior hemorrhage is the most consistent risk factor for future hemorrhage, other risk factors include deep venous drainage pattern, deep location, and so on. Surgical interventions, including surgical excision, intravascular intervention, and stereotactic radiation, have been developed with the aim to eliminate this source of hemorrhage. Among these methods, surgical excision was considered to be the gold standard for low grade intracranial AVMs. In ruptured AVMs, it is standard to wait several weeks to allow for patient recovery, hematoma liquefaction, and inflammatory reactions to subside, except for the life threatening hemorrhage. By separating the nidus from adjacent brain (the combined effects of the hematoma cavity and encephalomalacia), the hematoma creates a space for operator and facilitates AVM resection actually. There are some surgical nuances in ruptured versus unruptured AVM surgery. Detailed preoperative preparation is necessary to evaluate the general situation, neurological status, AVM architecture characteristic before surgery. Essential assistant technique, reasonable strategy and meticulous operative skill are crucial for the safety and validity of AVM resection.",2018 Aug,2018,Journal of neurosurgical sciences,62,4,478-483,eng,False,10.23736/S0390-5616.18.04413-2;S0390-5616.18.04413-2;10.23736/S0390-5616.18.04413-2,Journal Article;Review,Arteriovenous Fistula/complications/*surgery;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/*surgery;Intracranial Hemorrhages/etiology;Neurosurgical Procedures/*methods,
23683076,Benefit of cone-beam computed tomography angiography in acute management of angiographically undetectable ruptured arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECT: Ruptured arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are a frequent cause of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). In some cases, compression from the associated hematoma in the acute setting can partially or completely occlude an AVM, making it invisible on conventional angiography techniques. The authors report on the successful use of cone-beam CT angiography (CBCT-A) to precisely identify the underlying angioarchitecture of ruptured AVMs that are not visible on conventional angiography. METHODS: Three patients presented with ICH for which they underwent examination with CBCT-A in addition to digital subtraction angiography and other imaging modalities, including MR angiography and CT angiography. All patients underwent surgical evacuation due to mass effect from the hematoma. Clinical history, imaging studies, and surgical records were reviewed. Hematoma volumes were calculated. RESULTS: In all 3 cases, CBCT-A demonstrated detailed anatomy of an AVM where no lesion or just a suggestion of a draining vein had been seen with other imaging modalities. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated enhancement in 1 patient; CT angiography demonstrated a draining vein in 1 patient; 2D digital subtraction angiography and 3D rotational angiography demonstrated a suggestion of a draining vein in 2 cases and no finding in the third. In the 2 patients in whom CBCT-A was performed prior to surgery, the demonstrated AVM was successfully resected without evidence of a residual lesion. In the third patient, CBCT-A allowed precise targeting of the AVM nidus using Gamma Knife radiosurgery. CONCLUSIONS: Cone-beam CT angiography should be considered in the evaluation and subsequent treatment of ICH due to ruptured AVMs. In cases in which the associated hematoma compresses the AVM nidus, CBCT-A can have higher sensitivity and anatomical accuracy than traditional angiographic modalities, including digital subtraction angiography.",2013 Oct,2013,Journal of neurosurgery,119,4,1015-20,eng,False,10.3171/2013.4.JNS1390;10.3171/2013.4.JNS1390,Journal Article,"Adult;Aneurysm, Ruptured/*diagnostic imaging/surgery;Cerebral Angiography/*methods;Child, Preschool;Cone-Beam Computed Tomography/*methods;Craniotomy;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*diagnostic imaging/surgery;Male;Middle Aged;Treatment Outcome",

17450369,Incidence of vascular malformations in spontaneous intra-cerebral haemorrhage in children.,"AIM: To assess the incidence of vascular malformations in children presenting with non-traumatic intra-cerebral haemorrhage and outline the need for radiological investigations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1993 and 2002, 26 children presented with spontaneous intra-cerebral haemorrhage at a mean age of 26 months (range 1-192 months). RESULTS: Twenty-two children had, as first treatment, surgical removal of the haematoma and any malformation found. One patient with no evidence of vascular malformation had conservative treatment, two had embolisation and one had stereotactic radiosurgery of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). The diagnosis of vascular malformation was confirmed histologically and/or radiologically in 16 (61%) patients. Of these 16 patients, 7 were AVMs, 1 thrombosed middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysm, 1 cavernous angioma, 6 aggregates of abnormal vessels, 1 vein of Galen aneurysm. Pre-operatively, 12 patients had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and 7 were positive for vascular malformation (1 false positive) with no false negatives. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was performed pre-operatively in 7 patients, 4 were positive with no false negatives. There were no re-bleeds at the follow-up period. Five (19%) patients died from the haemorrhage, 7 (27%) had severe neurological deficit and 14 (54%) had no neurological deficit. Residual malformation after surgery requiring additional treatment was found in 3 (16%) patients. All patients with confirmed malformations were followed-up with DSA. CONCLUSION: MRI/MRA has high sensitivity and specificity in identifying vascular malformations in children presenting acutely with spontaneous intra-cerebral haemorrhage. This may prove useful when pre-operative DSA is not promptly available. After acute clot evacuation, there is high incidence of residual malformation and such patients should be followed-up with DSA.",2007 Aug,2007,Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for,23,8,881-6,eng,False,10.1007/s00381-007-0322-9,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Angiography, Digital Subtraction;Behavior;Cerebral Hemorrhage/diagnostic imaging/*epidemiology/pathology;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Humans;Infant;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Neurosurgical Procedures;Recurrence;Retrospective Studies;Risk;Seizures/etiology;Tomography, X-Ray Computed;Treatment Outcome;Unconsciousness/etiology",
20642886,Endovascular treatment accounts for a change in brain arteriovenous malformation natural history risk.,"This study estimated the risk and rates of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in patients harbor-ing brain arteriovenous malformation (BAVM) after endovascular embolization. One hundred and forty-four consecutive patients with BAVM treated with endovascular embolization between 1998 and 2003 were retrospectively reviewed. The risk of ICH subsequent to endovascular embolization was studied using Kaplan-Meier curves. We reviewed 144 patients with BAVM treated with endovascular embolization. Two hundred and sixty-nine procedures were performed, 69 were performed with silk sutures, 18 with coils, 137 with NBCA and 36 with Onyx18. Twenty-three (16.0%) patients were treated with additional gamma-knife radiosurgery and one (0.7%) with additional surgical AVM excision. Complete obliteration of BAVMs was achieved in 20 patients (13.9%). During a mean follow-up of 5.9 years for the ICH group and 6.9 years for the non-ICH group, hemorrhages occurred in 11 (17.7%) of the ICH patients and in nine (11%) of the non-ICH group (p>0.1). The annual risk of hemorrhage was 3.0% and 1.6%, respectively. In the multivariate regression model, the adjusted relative risk (RR) for hemorrhage at initial presentation was 1.6 (95% CI 1.2-3.2; p>0.1). Deep venous drainage, male sex, age or AVM size were not significantly associated with subsequent hemorrhage. ICH and non-ICH groups did not differ in progression to subsequent ICH after endovascular embolization (log-rank X (2) =1.339, p>0.1) in survival analyses. The overall annual hemorrhage risk for all patients after endovascular embolization was 2.1%.

24448188,Proton beam stereotactic radiosurgery for pediatric cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"BACKGROUND: For cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) determined to be high risk for surgery or endovascular embolization, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is considered the mainstay of treatment. OBJECTIVE: To determine the outcomes of pediatric patients with AVMs treated with proton SRS. METHODS: We reviewed the records of 44 consecutively treated pediatric patients (younger than 18 years of age) who underwent proton SRS at our institution from 1998 to 2010. The median target volume was 4.5 ± 5.9 mL (range, 0.3-29.0 mL) and the median maximal diameter was 3.6 ± 1.5 cm (range, 1-6 cm). Radiation was administered with a median prescription dose of 15.50 ± 1.87 CGE to the 90% isodose. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 52 ± 25 months, 2 patients (4.5%) had no response, 24 patients (59.1%) had a partial response, and 18 patients (40.9%) experienced obliteration of their AVM. The median time to obliteration was 49 ± 26 months, including 17 patients who underwent repeat proton radiosurgery. Four patients (9%) experienced hemorrhage after treatment at a median time of 45 ± 15 months. Univariate analysis identified modified AVM scale score (P = .045), single fraction treatment (0.04), larger prescription dose (0.01), larger maximum dose (<0.001), and larger minimum dose (0.01) to be associated with AVM obliteration.

20950972,Complication risk of endovascular embolization for cerebral arteriovenous malformation.,"OBJECTIVE: The embolic agents currently used for the treatment of AVMs are n-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA) and ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer (ONYX). The purpose of this study was to examine the overall NBCA and ONYX embolization-related complication rate. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 147 consecutive patients with cerebral AVMs treated mainly with endovascular NBCA and ONYX embolization. Demographics, including age, sex, presenting symptoms, and angiographic factors including AVM size, deep venous drainage, and involvement of eloquent cortex were recorded. Number of pedicles embolized, the obliteration rate, and any complications were recorded. Complications were classified as the following: bleeding and ischemic complications. The ischemic complications were also classified as transient neurologic deficit, and permanent deficits. Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores were collected pre- and postembolization on all patients. Univariate regression analysis of determinants of complications was performed. RESULTS: We reviewed 147 patients with BAVM (58.5% male; mean age±SD at treatment: 27.5±11.1 years) treated with endovascular embolization. Two hundred twenty embolization, 144 NBCA and 76 ONYX embolizations were performed. Complete obliteration of BAVMs were achieved in 29 patients (19.7%). Additional gamma-knife radiosurgery were performed for 32 (21.8%) patients. There were 5 Spetzler-Martin grade I (3.4%), 20 grade II (13.6%), 54 grade III (36.7%), 44 grade IV (30%), and 24 grade V (16.3%) AVMs. There were a total of 7 (4.8% per patient, 3.2% per procedure) complications. There were bleeding complications in 2 patients (1.4% per patient, 0.9% per procedure), transient neurologic deficits in 4 (2.7% per patient, 1.8% per procedure) and 1 permanent deficit (0.7% per patient, 0.5% per procedure). Of the 147 patients, 141 (95.9%) were mRS 0-2, 6 (4.1%) were mRS=3 at discharge.

17974613,Neurologic complications of arteriovenous malformation embolization using liquid embolic agents.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Embolization of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is commonly used to achieve nidal volume reduction before microsurgical resection or stereotactic radiosurgery. The purpose of this study was to examine the overall neurologic complication rate in patients undergoing AVM embolization and analyze the factors that may determine increased risk. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all patients with brain AVMs embolized at 1 center from 1995 through 2005. Demographics, including age, sex, presenting symptoms, and clinical condition, were recorded. Angiographic factors including maximal nidal size, presence of deep venous drainage, and involvement of eloquent cortex were also recorded. For each embolization session, the agent used, number of pedicles embolized, the percentage of nidal obliteration, and any complications were recorded. Complications were classified as the following: none, non-neurologic (mild), transient neurologic deficit, and permanent nondisabling and permanent disabling deficits. The permanent complications were also classified as ischemic or hemorrhagic. Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores were collected pre- and postembolization on all patients. Univariate regression analysis of factors associated with the development of any neurologic complication was performed. RESULTS: Four hundred eighty-nine embolization procedures were performed in 192 patients. There were 6 Spetzler-Martin grade I (3.1%), 26 grade II (13.5%), 71 grade III (37.0%), 57 grade IV (29.7%), and 32 grade V (16.7%) AVMs. Permanent nondisabling complications occurred in 5 patients (2.6%) and permanent disabling complications or deaths occurred in 3 (1.6%). In addition, there were non-neurologic complications in 4 patients (2.1%) and transient neurologic deficits in 22 (11.5%). Five of the 8 permanent complications (2.6% overall) were ischemic, and 3 of 8 (1.6% overall) were hemorrhagic. Of the 178 patients who were mRS 0-2 pre-embolization, 4 (2.3%) were dependent or dead (mRS >2) at follow-up.

15645150,Image-guided microneurosurgical management of small cerebral arteriovenous malformations: the value of navigated computed tomographic angiography.,"In small arteriovenous malformations (AVM) with large hematomas, surgery remains the main therapeutic option. However, intraoperative identification of the AVM, feeders, and draining veins could be difficult in the environment of substantial intracerebral blood. In those selected cases, we use navigated computed tomographic angiography (CTA) for the microneurosurgical management. It is our objective to report our initial experiences. Prior to operation a conventional CTA with superficial skin fiducials placed on a patient's head was acquired for diagnostic and neuronavigation purposes. Image data were transferred to a neuronavigation device with integrated volume rendering capacities which allows a three-dimensional reconstruction of the vascular tree and the AVM to be created. In all patients the AVM was removed successfully after having been localized with CTA-based neuronavigation. Navigated CTA is helpful for the operative management of small AVMs with large hematomas. The technique allows feeding arteries to be distinguished from draining veins thereby allowing the nidus of the AVM to be identified despite the presence of substantial intracerebral blood. CTA can be easily implemented into commercial neuronavigation systems.",2005 Jan,2005,Neuroradiology,47,1,66-72,eng,False,10.1007/s00234-004-1307-y,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Adult;Aged;Cerebellar Diseases/surgery;Cerebral Angiography/*methods;Cerebral Hemorrhage/surgery;Child;Child, Preschool;Contrast Media;Female;Hematoma/surgery;Hematoma, Subdural/surgery;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/methods;Imaging, Three-Dimensional/methods;Intracranial Aneurysm/surgery;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Iohexol/*analogs & derivatives;Male;Microsurgery/*methods;Neuronavigation/*methods;Surgery, Computer-Assisted/*methods;Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*methods",
19409010,Pathogenesis and radiobiology of brain arteriovenous malformations: implications for risk stratification in natural history and posttreatment course.,"Brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVMs) are an important cause of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in young adults. Biological predictors of future ICH risk are lacking, and controversy exists over previous studies of natural history risk among predominantly ruptured BAVM cohorts. Recent studies have suggested that the majority of BAVMs are now diagnosed as unruptured lesions, and that the risk according to natural history among these lesions may be less than previously assumed. In the first part of this review, the authors discuss available data on the natural history of BAVMs and highlight the need for future studies that aim to develop surrogate biomarkers of disease progression that accurately predict future risk of ICH in BAVMs. The etiology of BAVM remains unknown. Recent studies have suggested a role for genetic factors in the pathogenesis of sporadic BAVM, which is further supported by reports of familial occurrence of BAVM and association with known systemic genetic disorders (such as Osler-Weber-Rendu disease, Sturge-Weber disease, and Wyburn-Mason syndrome). Molecular characterization of BAVM tissue demonstrates a highly angiogenic milieu with evidence of increased endothelial cell turnover. Taken together with a number of reports of de novo BAVM formation, radiographic growth after initial BAVM diagnosis, and regrowth after successful treatment of BAVM, these findings challenge the long-held assumption that BAVMs are static lesions of congenital origin. In the second part of this review, the authors discuss available data on the origins of BAVM and offer insights into future investigations into genetics and endothelial progenitor cell involvement in the pathogenesis of BAVM. Current treatment options for BAVM focus on removal or obliteration of the lesion in an attempt to protect against future ICH risk, including microsurgical resection, endovascular embolization, and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). In the third part of this review, the authors discuss available data on SRS in BAVMs and highlight the need for future studies on the radiobiology of BAVMs, especially in regard to biomarker detection for tracking SRS response during the latency period. Insights from future investigations in BAVM may not only prove important for the development of novel therapies and relevant biomarkers for BAVM, but could also potentially benefit a variety of other disorders involving new vessel formation in the CNS, including stroke, tumors, moyamoya disease, and other cerebrovascular malformations.",2009 May,2009,Neurosurgical focus,26,5,E9,eng,False,10.3171/2009.2.FOCUS0926;10.3171/2009.2.FOCUS0926,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't;Review","Angiogenic Proteins/genetics/metabolism;Cerebral Arteries/*abnormalities/*diagnostic imaging/physiopathology;Cerebral Veins/*abnormalities/*diagnostic imaging/physiopathology;Endothelial Cells/metabolism/pathology;Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/genetics/*physiopathology/surgery;Neovascularization, Pathologic/genetics;Neurosurgical Procedures/methods/trends;Radiography;Risk Factors;Vascular Surgical Procedures/methods/trends",

22663933,Hemorrhage risk after partial endovascular NBCA and ONYX embolization for brain arteriovenous malformation.,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate for hemorrhage risk of partially endovascularly embolized brain arteriovenous malformation (BAVM). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 147 consecutive patients with BAVM-treated mainly with endovascular N-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA) and ONYX embolization. In Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, the index date was the dated of initial endovascular embolization; cases were censored at time of subsequent intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), or loss to follow-up, and multivariate proportional-hazards regression models included age of presentation (≤30 years old), clinical presentations, and other potential confounders. RESULTS: We reviewed 147 patients with BAVM (58.8% male; mean age±SD at treatment: 27.5±11.1 years) treated with endovascular embolization. One hundred and forty-four NBCA and 76 ONYX embolizations were performed. Complete obliteration of BAVMs was achieved in 29 patients (19.7%). Thirty-two (21.8%) patients were treated with additional Gamma-knife radiosurgery. During 499.5 years of follow-up, 15 partially treated patients suffered a further hemorrhage, which caused four deaths. The crude annual risk of hemorrhage was 3.0% and the annual death rate was 0.8%. Among partially treated patients with hemorrhage at initial presentation, the risk of hemorrhage was 3.8%, while the risk of hemorrhage for patients without hemorrhage at initial presentation was 2.5%. The annual rate of subsequent hemorrhage was 2.6% for non-ICH and 4.2% for ICH in the partial NBCA embolization group compared with 2.4% for non-ICH and 2.4% for ICH in the partial ONYX embolization group.

31096254,Leksell Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Cavernous Malformations.,"Cavernous malformations (CM) represent a distinct subgroup of brain vascular malformations that are characterized by small sinusoidal vascular channels with hyaline degeneration and old blood pigments. Because of the increasing availability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) they are detected much more frequently in the present era. CM may be solitary or found in the context of a familial variant that results in an increasing number of CM developing as the patient ages. Because of the variable risk of subacute bleeding, their management options have been controversial. The annual risk of an incidentally detected CM bleeding is <0.5% each year. Leksell radiosurgery is used for a subgroup of patients who have repeatedly bled. In general, CM best considered for stereotactic radiosurgery are deep seated and do not pre-sent to a pial or ependymal surface where microsurgical corridors for removal are feasible. When radiosurgery is used for patients at high risk for both re-bleeding as well as microsurgical resection, the risk of bleeding can be reduced from as high as 33% each year to <0.5% each year after a 2-year latency interval. The target lies within the hemosiderin rim detected during the MRI that is part of planning.

20023542,Endovascular treatment increases but gamma knife radiosurgery decreases angiogenic activity of arteriovenous malformations: an in vivo experimental study using a rat cornea model.,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the angiogenic potentials of embolized, gamma knife-treated or untreated cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), using a rat cornea angiogenesis model. METHODS: Tissue samples from cerebral AVM patients who were either untreated or had previously been treated with embolization or gamma knife radiosurgery and who had undergone operations for hemorrhage at the Neurosurgery Department or the Neurological Sciences Institute of Marmara University were used. For the macroscopic evaluation of angiogenesis, tissue samples were inoculated in a micropocket created on the rat eye, and the level of angiogenic activity was graded macroscopically for 15 days, with glioblastoma multiforme and normal brain artery tissues serving as positive and negative controls, respectively. For the other part of the experiment, eyes of another set of rats were inoculated with the study samples only using the same cornea angiogenesis model, in which microvessel count and vascular endothelial growth factor assessment was done at days 3, 7, 11, and 15. RESULTS: Based on our macroscopic findings in the cornea angiogenesis model, embolized AVMs exhibited the highest angiogenic activity, followed by untreated AVMs and gamma knife-treated AVMs. Evaluations of vascular endothelial growth factor expression and microvessel counts showed a similar relation among the 3 tissue groups with regard to the level of angiogenic activity, supporting the results of macroscopic examinations. CONCLUSION: This study, for the first time, provides experimental semiquantitative data to compare the angiogenic potentials of embolized and gamma knife-treated AVM tissues. Embolization may increase angiogenic activity, and gamma knife radiosurgery may decrease it when compared with activity in previously untreated AVMs. These data can be useful to understand why recurrence of AVMs after angiographically demonstrated endovascular occlusion is common but after gamma knife occlusion is rare.",2010 Jan,2010,Neurosurgery,66,1,121-9; discussion 129-30,eng,False,10.1227/01.NEU.0000363154.88768.34;00006123-201001000-00013;10.1227/01.NEU.0000363154.88768.34,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adolescent;Adult;Animals;Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/pathology/*surgery;Blood Vessels/metabolism/pathology;Cerebral Angiography/methods;Chi-Square Distribution;Cornea/pathology/physiopathology;Disease Models, Animal;Embolization, Therapeutic/methods;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Neovascularization, Pathologic/etiology/pathology/*surgery;Radiosurgery/*methods;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Retrospective Studies;Time Factors;Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism;Young Adult",
26430846,Live-cell imaging to detect phosphatidylserine externalization in brain endothelial cells exposed to ionizing radiation: implications for the treatment of brain arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECT Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is an established intervention for brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). The processes of AVM vessel occlusion after SRS are poorly understood. To improve SRS efficacy, it is important to understand the cellular response of blood vessels to radiation. The molecular changes on the surface of AVM endothelial cells after irradiation may also be used for vascular targeting. This study investigates radiation-induced externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS) on endothelial cells using live-cell imaging. METHODS An immortalized cell line generated from mouse brain endothelium, bEnd.3 cells, was cultured and irradiated at different radiation doses using a linear accelerator. PS externalization in the cells was subsequently visualized using polarity-sensitive indicator of viability and apoptosis (pSIVA)-IANBD, a polarity-sensitive probe. Live-cell imaging was used to monitor PS externalization in real time. The effects of radiation on the cell cycle of bEnd.3 cells were also examined by flow cytometry. RESULTS Ionizing radiation effects are dose dependent. Reduction in the cell proliferation rate was observed after exposure to 5 Gy radiation, whereas higher radiation doses (15 Gy and 25 Gy) totally inhibited proliferation. In comparison with cells treated with sham radiation, the irradiated cells showed distinct pseudopodial elongation with little or no spreading of the cell body. The percentages of pSIVA-positive cells were significantly higher (p = 0.04) 24 hours after treatment in the cultures that received 25- and 15-Gy doses of radiation. This effect was sustained until the end of the experiment (3 days). Radiation at 5 Gy did not induce significant PS externalization compared with the sham-radiation controls at any time points (p > 0.15). Flow cytometric analysis data indicate that irradiation induced growth arrest of bEnd.3 cells, with cells accumulating in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. CONCLUSIONS Ionizing radiation causes remarkable cellular changes in endothelial cells. Significant PS externalization is induced by radiation at doses of 15 Gy or higher, concomitant with a block in the cell cycle.

24013265,Clinical features and endovascular treatment of intracranial arteriovenous malformations in pediatric patients.,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to characterize clinical features and evaluate the clinical outcome of endovascular embolization treatment intracranial arteriovenous malformations in pediatric patients. METHODS: A cohort of children (age ≤ 18 years) with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) from 2000 to 2012 was included. Predictors studied included patient gender, age, and angioarchitectural features, including AVM location, nidus morphology and size, venous drainage, and associated aneurysms. Treatment method, complications and outcomes were recorded. The features of AVMs were evaluated before the treatment. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-seven children (77 males, mean age 13.2 years) were included; 90/127 (70.9 %) children were presented with hemorrhage. AVM size and deep venous drainage were independently associated with hemorrhage; 66/127 patients (52 %) treated with endovascular embolization. Complete obliteration at the end of all endovascular procedures was achieved in 14/66 patients (21.2 %), with an average of 78 % (range, 20-100 %) volume reduction. A mean of 2.9 (range, 1-9) feeding pedicles was embolized per patient. Overall, nine complications occurred in a total of 123 procedures (7.3 %). There was no procedure-related death in this study population. There was no significant difference between patients with and without complications in terms of AVM grade, demographic characteristics, or embolization features. CONCLUSIONS: AVM size and deep venous drainage were independently associated with hemorrhage in pediatric patients.

23259821,Characteristics and long-term outcome of 251 patients with dural arteriovenous fistulas in a defined population.,"OBJECT: Management of dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) has changed during the last decades due to increased knowledge of their pathophysiology and natural history as well as advances in treatment modalities. The authors describe the characteristics and long-term outcome of a large consecutive series of patients with DAVFs. METHODS: Altogether 251 patients with 261 DAVFs were treated in 2 of the 5 neurosurgery departments at Helsinki and Kuopio University Hospitals between 1944 and 2006. Clinical data and radiological examinations were reviewed to assess patients' overall long-term clinical outcome. RESULTS: The detection rate of DAVFs increased markedly in the 1970s and again in the 1990s when digital subtraction angiography was introduced. The incidence of DAVFs in a defined southern Finnish population was 0.51 per 100,000 individuals per year, which represents 32% of all the brain arteriovenous malformations. In the early part of the series, DAVFs were treated by proximal ligation of the feeding arteries. Later, most of the patients underwent preoperative embolization and subsequent craniotomy, and since 2000 stereotactic radiosurgery has been increasingly used in the treatment of DAVFs. Fifty-nine percent of the 261 fistulas were totally occluded. Treatment-related major complications were seen in 21 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The advances in diagnostic methods (digital subtraction angiography, CT, and MRI) increased the detection rate of DAVFs, and as treatment modalities developed, the results of treatment and outcome of patients markedly improved with the introduction of endovascular techniques and stereotactic radiosurgery. Microsurgery is of limited use in DAVFs resistant to other treatment modalities.",2013 May,2013,Journal of neurosurgery,118,5,923-34,eng,False,10.3171/2012.11.JNS111604;10.3171/2012.11.JNS111604,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Angiography, Digital Subtraction;Central Nervous System Vascular Malformations/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*surgery;Child;Child, Preschool;*Disease Management;Female;Finland/epidemiology;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Incidence;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Longitudinal Studies;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Neurosurgical Procedures;Prognosis;Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Tomography, X-Ray Computed;Young Adult",
20489509,Through the choroidal fissure: a quantitative anatomic comparison of 2 incisions and trajectories (transsylvian transchoroidal and lateral transtemporal).,"BACKGROUND: We compared the transsylvian transchoroidal (TSTC) approach with the lateral transtemporal (LTT) approach. Both approaches proceed through the choroidal fissure but through different incisions and along different trajectories. METHODS: Four fixed, silicon-injected heads (8 sides) were used. Nine strategic anatomic points within the dissections were compared between the TSTC and LTT approaches in 7 other silicon-injected heads (14 sides). Neuronavigation was used to gather coordinates from selected points of both approaches to calculate surgical angles and distances to common targets. RESULTS: The surgical angle of the TSTC approach for the inferior choroidal point was wider compared with the LTT approach (P < .05). The surgical angles for the P2a-P2p point were similar for both approaches. In the TSTC approach, the P2-P3 point angle was smaller than in the LTT approach (P < .05). The TSTC approach provided (except for the P2-P3 point) significantly shorter distances to all defined anatomic targets compared with the LTT approach. When the posterior cerebral artery was the target in the TSTC approach, the hippocampus was retracted 3 to 8 mm compared with 8 to 13 mm in the LTT approach. CONCLUSION: We quantitatively described anatomic features of the TSTC approach and compared them with the LTT approach. For approaching the mesial temporal region, the TSTC approach offers an adequate surgical angle and shorter or similar distances proximal to P2-P3 and requires less temporal lobe and hippocampal retraction than the LTT approach. Such information can help surgeons select the optimal approach to the mesial temporal lobe and its surrounding structures. The TSTC approach should be considered for lesions located in the medial temporal region.",2010 Jun,2010,Neurosurgery,66,6 Suppl Operative,221-8; discussion 228-9,eng,False,10.1227/01.NEU.0000369920.68166.6C;00006123-201006001-00006;10.1227/01.NEU.0000369920.68166.6C,Comparative Study;Journal Article,"Brain Neoplasms/surgery;Cadaver;Cerebral Cortex/anatomy & histology/surgery;Choroid Plexus/anatomy & histology/surgery;Cranial Fossa, Middle/anatomy & histology/surgery;Hippocampus/anatomy & histology/*surgery;Humans;Intracranial Aneurysm/surgery;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery;Intraoperative Complications/etiology/physiopathology/prevention & control;Lateral Ventricles/anatomy & histology/*surgery;Middle Cerebral Artery/anatomy & histology/surgery;Neuronavigation/*methods/standards;Neurosurgical Procedures/*methods/standards;Posterior Cerebral Artery/anatomy & histology/surgery;Subarachnoid Space/anatomy & histology/surgery;Temporal Lobe/anatomy & histology/*surgery",

18195381,"Intracranial arteriovenous malformation: time-resolved contrast-enhanced MR angiography with combination of parallel imaging, keyhole acquisition, and k-space sampling techniques at 1.5 T.","PURPOSE: To prospectively compare the agreement between digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and time-resolved magnetic resonance (MR) angiography with sensitivity encoding (SENSE) in combination with keyhole acquisition and contrast material-enhanced robust-timing angiography (CENTRA) k-space sampling techniques for the characterization of intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The institutional review board approved the study; informed consent was obtained from all patients (or their parents). Twenty-eight patients (15 male, 13 female; mean age, 38.6 years; age range, 16-61 years) with 29 previously diagnosed, untreated intracranial AVMs who were referred for stereotactic gamma knife radiosurgery were evaluated. Preinterventional imaging included intraarterial DSA and time-resolved MR angiography. The time-resolved MR angiography sequence included SENSE with a 1.5-T imager and was optimized by applying keyhole acquisition and CENTRA techniques. Time-resolved MR angiograms were reviewed by two independent raters and compared with DSA images with regard to arterial feeders, nidus size, and venous drainage. kappa Statistics were applied to determine interobserver and intermodality agreement. RESULTS: MR angiography enabled time-resolved (1.7 seconds per volume) visualization of cerebral vessels from axis to vertex at high spatial resolution (true voxel size, 1 x 1 x 2 mm). All 25 nidi detected at intraarterial DSA were visualized at time-resolved MR angiography. Intermodality agreement was excellent for arterial feeders (kappa = 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.786, 1.000) and venous drainage (kappa = 0.94; 95% CI: 0.814, 1.000) and was good for nidus size (kappa = 0.76; 95% CI: 0.562, 0.950).

28830640,The 'radical combined approach' in cerebral arteriovenous malformation treatment: Technical note.,"AVMs are vessel anomalies where a connection between arterial and venous systems is present and the capillary bed is absent between the two. AVMs tend to present with seizures, headaches, focal neurological deficits and hemorrhage. Hemorrhage is the most common form of presentation. AVM's have a 2-4% annual risk of hemorrhage. Certain studies report this rate as 1%. The greatest discussion in AVM treatment is whether to use interventional treatment or monitor with medical treatment. There are 3 modalities that can be used for interventional treatment; microsurgical resection, endovascular embolization and stereotactic radiosurgery. Combined techniques are also possible. We defined the 'radical combined approach' combines embolization and microsurgery.

32208976,A comparison of arterial spin labelling with catheter angiography in evaluating arteriovenous malformations: a systematic review.,"OBJECTIVES: To compare the performance of arterial spin labelling (ASL) in evaluating arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) against the current gold standard of catheter angiography. METHODS: We systematically reviewed the published literature using EMBASE and Medline. We included studies that compared ASL to catheter angiography in the assessment of AVMs in three outcome domains: detection, angioarchitectural and haemodynamic features. RESULTS: From 314 unique citations, 19 studies representing 289 patients with intracranial AVMs met our inclusion criteria. We did not pool data due to marked heterogeneity in study outcome measures. Seven studies showed high diagnostic performance of ASL in identifying arterial feeders, with sensitivity ranging from 84.6 to 100% and specificity ranging from 93.3 to 100%. Six studies showed strong ability in detecting arteriovenous shunting, with sensitivity ranging from 91.7 to 100% and specificity ranging from 90 to 100%. Seven studies demonstrated that ASL could identify nidal location and size as well as catheter angiography, while five studies showed relatively poorer performance in delineating venous drainage. Two studies showed 100% sensitivity of ASL in the identification of residual or obliterated AVMs following stereotactic radiosurgery. CONCLUSIONS: Despite limitations in the current evidence base and technical challenges, this review suggests that ASL has a promising role in the work-up and post-treatment follow-up of AVMs. Larger scale prospective studies assessing the diagnostic performance of ASL are warranted.

The purpose of this study is to report the angiographic change of AVF components of CAVMs after SRS and outcomes of endovascular embolisation. METHODS: From 2002 to 2012, a total of 523 CAVMs had been treated primarily by SRS with more than 3-year latency. Among these databases, there were 19 patients with 21 AVFs undergoing embolization after SRS. We retrospectively analyzed the angioarchitecture of the CAVM to identify AVFs, morphologic change and outcomes of AVFs after SRS and embolisation. RESULTS: Eight AVFs were in the periphery of CAVMs, the other 13 were in a central location. Eighteen of 21 AVFs remained constant in morphology after SRS, while three feeders of AVFs were associated with radiation arteritis. The causes of failure to identify AVFs before SRS were overlooked (n = 7) or there was superimposition with feeders, nidus and/or venous drains of CAVMs (n = 14). Total fistula occlusion was achieved in all 21 AVFs; residual CAVMs was totally obliterated by embolisation and/or additional SRS in 12 patients. One patient had a small procedure-related intracerebral hemorrhage. Mean follow-up period was 26 months. CONCLUSIONS: Early detection of AVF components of CAVMs prior to SRS may be difficult, particularly those in a central location. However, most AVFs became evident and showed consistency in angiographic morphology after obliteration of the majority nidus parts of CAVMs. Endovascular embolisation is effective in managing these AVF components.",2014 Jan,2014,Acta neurochirurgica,156,1,85-92; discussion 92,eng,False,10.1007/s00701-013-1939-y;10.1007/s00701-013-1939-y,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adult;Aged;Arteriovenous Fistula/epidemiology/pathology/*therapy;Cerebral Angiography/methods;Cerebral Hemorrhage/pathology/radiotherapy/*surgery;*Embolization, Therapeutic/methods;Female;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/pathology/*therapy;Male;Middle Aged;Retrospective Studies;Treatment Outcome",
26721617,The Anterior Subcallosal Approach to Third Ventricular and Suprasellar Lesions: Anatomical Description and Technical Note.,"BACKGROUND: Surgical access to the third ventricle is challenging, given the depth of the operative field and close proximity of vital neural structures that must be traversed. For anterior third ventricular lesions, approach options include anterior transcallosal or transcortical, subfrontal, frontotemporal, or endonasal. The subcallosal approach, a translamina terminalis approach, is unique in that the surgical corridor is just below the corpus callosum, minimizes retraction and preserves corpus callosum integrity. Case examples are provided, and an anatomical study delineating the dimensions of the surgical corridor is performed. METHODS: Two latex-injected cadaver heads were used to describe the subcallosal corridor. A magnetic resonance imaging scan was obtained and registered with neuronavigation for correlative anatomical illustration. Depth, dimensions, and cross-sectional area were measured for the subcommunicating and supracommunicating corridors. RESULTS: The surgical depth for anterior transcallosal, subcallosal, and subfrontal approaches was 7.5 cm, 7.7 cm, and 7.6 cm respectively. The average corridor dimensions for the subcallosal approach were 14.75 × 6.63 mm compared with 8.88 × 5.38 mm for the subcommunicating corridor. Cross-sectional area of the subcommunicating corridor was 30.62 mm(2) compared with 80.42 mm(2) for supracommunicating. This was easily enlarged to 156.62 mm(2) with gentle retraction. CONCLUSIONS: The anterior subcallosal approach is a safe approach for lesions of the third ventricle that avoids splitting the corpus callosum and resecting unnecessary brain and minimizes brain retraction. This corridor is superior to the traditional subfrontal approach in terms of working space and compares favorably to the anterior transcallosal approach without disrupting the corpus callosum.",2016 Mar,2016,World neurosurgery,87,,187-94,eng,False,S1878-8750(15)01681-2;10.1016/j.wneu.2015.12.011;S1878-8750(15)01681-2;10.1016/j.wneu.2015.12.011,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Anatomy, Cross-Sectional;Cadaver;Cerebral Ventricle Neoplasms/complications/pathology/surgery;Corpus Callosum/anatomy & histology/surgery;Craniopharyngioma/surgery;Female;Humans;Hydrocephalus/etiology/surgery;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Memory Disorders/etiology;Middle Aged;Neuronavigation;Neurosurgical Procedures/*methods;Pituitary Gland/anatomy & histology/*surgery;Third Ventricle/anatomy & histology/*surgery;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",Cavernous malformation;Lamina terminalis;Surgical approach;Third ventricle

We describe a new method to improve the speed and reliability of visualizing the flow of contrast images with digital subtraction angiography. METHODS: In line with current practices, digital subtraction angiography was used to produce a sequence of grayscale images. The new method combines the standard grayscale images produced by digital subtraction angiography into a single composite color image that encodes the contrast arrival time at each point of the brain's circulatory system. The algorithm is simple, fast, and easy to implement. RESULTS: The technique allows the flow of contrast from a series of angiography images to be summarized in a single color image. CONCLUSION: This visualization method promises to improve the speed of manual delineation of arteriovenous malformations.

15952682,Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia: state of the art.,"Hereditary haemorrhagic teleangiectasia (HHT) or Rendu-Osler-Weber disease is a genetic autosomal-dominant disorder characterised by the presence of vascular telangiectases in mucocutaneous tissues, visceral organs and the Central Nervous System. Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations have a variable incidence rate ranging between 15-33%, and the safest treatment is transcatheter embolotherapy. Haemmorrhages from the gastrointestinal tract occur in 10-40% of patients with HHT localized in duodenum and colon and can be treated with endoscopy and laser coagulation, but this procedure is not efficacious for vascular anomalies in small intestine since this site cannot be easily reached. The prevalence of cerebrovascular malformations in hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia patients is 5-27%, and there are several types described including telangiectasias, cavernous angiomas, arteriovenous malformations, and aneurysms. Cerebrovascular malformations can be treated by: neurovascular surgery, embolization, and stereotactic radiosurgery, but the appropriate course of action for dealing with asymptomatic cerebrovascular malformations is still debated. The most common symptom in HHT patients is epistaxis, which can sometimes be so profuse that it requires multiple transfusions and iron supplementation. Nose bleeds begin before 10 years of age and become more severe in later decades. A multitude of different treatments are available, tailored to the severity of epistaxis. These include: hormonal therapy with oestrogens, application of fibrine tissue sealant, laser coagulation, embolization and septal dermoplasty using Saunder's technique. Aim of this study is to review diagnostic and therapeutic techniques, since continuous growth and danger of these arteriovenous malformations require early diagnosis, adequate treatment, prolonged follow-up and screening of the family.",2004 Dec,2004,Acta otorhinolaryngologica Italica : organo ufficiale della Societa italiana di,24,6,330-6,eng,False,,Journal Article;Review,"Embolization, Therapeutic/*instrumentation;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis;Laser Therapy/*methods;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Telangiectasia, Hereditary Hemorrhagic/*diagnosis/physiopathology/*therapy",

36314435,Transvenous embolization of vein of galen aneurysmal malformations with coils as a final procedure for cure: A single-institution experience of 18 years.,"INTRODUCTION: Staged, transarterial embolization (TAE) is currently considered the gold standard for the treatment of vein of Galen aneurysmal malformation (VGAM); however, as transarterial access becomes restricted, further staged TAE may become ineffective or carry an increased risk of hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke when attempting complete obliteration. OBJECTIVE: To describe the first consecutive, retrospective series of VGAM treated with transvenous embolization (TVE) with coils alone, as the final treatment in staged endovascular therapy, at a single institution between January 2004 and September 2021. RESULTS: A total of 10 patients with a median age of 5.5 (IQR: 9.25) years were treated with coiling TVE. Patients were treated with a median number of 5 (IQR: 2.75) TAEs prior to the final TVE treatment. Complete or near-complete immediate angiographic obliteration was achieved in eight patients. Immediate post-procedural (within 48 h) hemorrhagic complications were noted in two patients (20%), one of whom passed away while the second suffered from hemiparesis. Stereotactic radiosurgery was performed in two patients with incomplete obliteration after TVE. The median follow-up time after TVE was 17 (IQR: 9) months. At long-term follow up (17 months) for the remaining nine patients, all VGAMs were completely obliterated. Long-term clinical deterioration compared to pre-TVE was noticed in one case. CONCLUSION: Transvenous coil embolization is a technically feasible but risky option, as a final-stage treatment for cure of VGAMs with restricted trans-arterial access. Although TVE with coils remains an effective therapeutic modality, we recommend continuing investigation of safer TVE techniques to achieve cure.",2024 Aug,2024,"Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology,",30,4,463-469,eng,False,10.1177/15910199221135066;10.1177_15910199221135066;10.1177/15910199221135066,Journal Article,"Humans;*Embolization, Therapeutic/methods;Male;Female;Retrospective Studies;Child;*Vein of Galen Malformations/therapy/diagnostic imaging;Child, Preschool;Cerebral Angiography;Infant;Adolescent;Treatment Outcome",coil embolization;transarterial embolization;transvenous embolization;vein of galen aneurysmal malformations
38552890,Pathologic features of brain hemorrhage after radiation treatment: case series with somatic mutation analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Radiation treatment for diseases of the brain can result in hemorrhagic adverse radiation effects. The underlying pathologic substrate of brain bleeding after irradiation has not been elucidated, nor potential associations with induced somatic mutations. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed our department's pathology database over 5 years and identified 5 biopsy specimens (4 patients) for hemorrhagic lesions after brain irradiation. Tissues with active malignancy were excluded. Samples were characterized using H&E, Perl's Prussian Blue, and Masson's Trichrome; immunostaining for B-cells (anti-CD20), T-cells (anti-CD3), endothelium (anti-CD31), macrophages (anti-CD163), α-smooth muscle actin, and TUNEL. DNA analysis was done by two panels of next-generation sequencing for somatic mutations associated with known cerebrovascular anomalies. RESULTS: One lesion involved hemorrhagic expansion among multifocal microbleeds that had developed after craniospinal irradiation for distant medulloblastoma treatment. Three bleeds arose in the bed of focally irradiated arteriovenous malformations (AVM) after confirmed obliteration. A fifth specimen involved the radiation field distinct from an irradiated AVM bed. From these, 2 patterns of hemorrhagic vascular pathology were identified: encapsulated hematomas and cavernous-like malformations. All lesions included telangiectasias with dysmorphic endothelium, consistent with primordial cavernous malformations with an associated inflammatory response. DNA analysis demonstrated genetic variants in PIK3CA and/or PTEN genes but excluded mutations in CCM genes. CONCLUSIONS: Despite pathologic heterogeneity, brain bleeding after irradiation is uniformly associated with primordial cavernous-like telangiectasias and disruption of genes implicated in dysangiogenesis but not genes implicated as causative of cerebral cavernous malformations.

32112802,Brainstem cavernous malformations - no longer a forbidden territory? A systemic review of recent literature.,"BACKGROUND: Due to its eloquent location and potentially devastating neurological consequences, the management of brainstem cavernous malformations (CCMs) attracts considerable debate. There is currently a paucity of Level 1 evidence for their management. The aim of this literature review is to explore the current evidence on the risk-benefit profile of different management options. METHODS: A systemic literature search, following the PRISMA algorithm was performed on publications between 2010 and 2018 using the Pubmed database, with the relevant keywords. Only English articles were included. Articles focusing on spinal CCMs and studies with less than 30 participants were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 222 search results were reviewed and after removal of duplicates and screening of abstracts, 28 clinical papers comprising 30 or more brainstem CCM cases were included in the study. The heterogeneity of the publications precluded a formal meta-analysis of results. The general consensus is that for CCMs presenting with severe symptoms and/or multiple haemorrhages that reach an accessible pial surface, surgery is considered to be the gold-standard treatment, with some authors suggesting the optimal timing to be within two to six weeks of ictus. For those patients with multiple, deep-seated CCM related haemorrhages that do not reach the pial surface, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) can be considered. Conservative treatment is generally considered in incidental cases. Management of brainstem cavernomas of other categories still remains controversial. CONCLUSIONS: Due to their highly eloquent location, brainstem CCMs are challenging lesions to manage. Management must be balanced by the risk-benefit profile and tailored to the individual patients and their treating clinicians. This review provides a comprehensive reference considering all treatment options and provides a basis for evidence-based patient counselling.",2020 Apr,2020,Neuro-Chirurgie,66,2,116-126,eng,False,S0028-3770(20)30032-1;10.1016/j.neuchi.2019.12.006;S0028-3770(20)30032-1;10.1016/j.neuchi.2019.12.006,Journal Article;Systematic Review,"Brain Stem/*abnormalities/*surgery;Hemangioma, Cavernous, Central Nervous System/*surgery;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Neurosurgical Procedures/*methods;Risk Assessment",Brainstem cavernomas;Cavernous malformations;Cerebral cavernomas
25496682,Curative glubran 2 embolization of cerebral arteriovenous malformations patient selection and initial results.,"The liquid embolic agents currently used for embolization of cerebral arteriovenous malformations are Onyx and NBCA. Glubran 2, a cyanoacrylate-based synthetic glue, has recently been applied for embolization of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). We report the clinical results of selected cerebral AVMs treated with Glubran 2 targeting for curative embolization. Between October 2011 and March 2013, 31 patients with cerebral AVMs were selected for curative embolization with Glubran 2. There were 19 men and 12 women with a mean age of 32 years (range 4-65 years). Initial clinical presentation included hemorrhage in 28 and seizures in three patients. AVM location was frontal in eight patients, parietal in four, occipital in eight temporal in six, cerebellar in two and cerebellar vermis in three patients. Follow-up was performed clinically and with angiography examination at three to six months. Clinical outcomes were evaluated based on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). A mean of 2.5 (range, 1-12) feeding pedicles were embolized per patient. Complete angiographic obliteration of AVM was achieved in 27 patients. A hemorrhagic complication was observed in one patient, an ischemic complication in one patient and technical complications in four patients. There was no procedure-related disabling neurological deficit or death at discharge. Additional gamma knife radiosurgery was performed in five patients, including one patient with recurrent AVM. All of the patients had favorable clinical outcomes at three to six month follow-up (mRS≤2). The curative embolization technique with Glubran 2 for selected cerebral AVMs achieved a high initial complete obliteration rate with an acceptable complication frequency.",2014 Dec,2014,"Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology,",20,6,722-8,eng,False,10.15274/INR-2014-10063;IN.v20.i6.p722;10.15274/INR-2014-10063,Journal Article,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Central Nervous System Vascular Malformations/complications/diagnostic;Cerebral Angiography;Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology/therapy;Child;Child, Preschool;Cyanoacrylates/*therapeutic use;Embolization, Therapeutic/*methods;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Patient Selection;Radiosurgery;Retrospective Studies;Seizures/etiology/therapy;Tomography, X-Ray Computed;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",Glubran 2;arteriovenous malformation;cerebral;curative embolization;embolization
17543995,Surgical options in ICH including decompressive craniectomy.,"Intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) accounts for 15 to 20% of strokes. The condition carries a higher morbidity and mortality than occlusive stroke. Despite considerable research effort, no therapeutic modality either medical or surgical has emerged with clear evidence of benefit other than in rare aneurysmal cases. Intracerebral haemorrhages can be divided into those that arise from pre-existing macroscopic vascular lesions - so called ""ictohaemorrhagic lesions"", and those that do not; the latter being the commoner. Most of the research that has been done on the benefits of surgery has been in this latter group. Trial data available to date precludes a major benefit from surgical evacuation in a large proportion of cases however there are hypotheses of benefit still under investigation, specifically superficial lobar ICH treated by open surgical evacuation, deeper ICH treated with minimally invasive surgical techniques, and decompressive craniectomy. When an ICH arises from an ictohaemorrhagic lesion, therapy has two goals: to treat the effects of the acute haemorrhage and to prevent a recurrence. Three modalities are available for treating lesions to prevent recurrence: stereotactic radiosurgery, endovascular embolisation, and open surgical resection. As with ICH without an underlying lesion there is no evidence to support surgical removal of the haemorrhage in most cases. An important exception is ICHs arising from intracranial aneurysms where there is good evidence to support evacuation of the haematoma as well as repair of the aneurysm.",2007 Oct 15,2007,Journal of the neurological sciences,261,1-2,89-98,eng,False,S0022-510X(07)00308-5;10.1016/j.jns.2007.04.040,Journal Article;Review,"Brain/*surgery;Central Nervous System Vascular Malformations/complications;Cerebral Hemorrhage/diagnostic imaging/*surgery;Decompression, Surgical/*methods;Hematoma/diagnostic imaging;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications;Tomography, X-Ray Computed",
26613173,Rescue N-butyl-2 cyanoacrylate embolectomy using a Solitaire FR device after venous glue migration during arteriovenous malformation embolization: technical note.,"One of the procedural risks in arteriovenous malformation (AVM) embolization is possible migration of the embolic agent into the venous drainage with an incomplete nidus occlusion, which may lead to severe hemorrhagic complications. This report presents the case of a 29-year-old man who presented with a deep intraparenchymal hematoma on the left side secondary to the spontaneous rupture of a claustral AVM. Upon resorption of the hematoma, the patient underwent an initial therapeutic session of N-butyl-2 cyanoacrylate endovascular embolization, with the purpose of reducing the AVM volume and flow before performing Gamma Knife radiosurgery. After glue injection into one of the arterial feeders, the control angiography showed a partial migration of the glue cast into the straight sinus, with most of the nidus still visible. Because of the bleeding risk due to possible venous hypertension, it was decided to try to retrieve the glue from the vein by using a stent retriever via jugular access. This maneuver allowed a nearly complete removal of the glue cast, thereby restoring normal venous flow drainage. The patient showed no clinical worsening after the procedure. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of the use of the Solitaire FR device as a rescue glue retriever. This method should be considered by physicians in cases of unintended glue migration into the venous circulation during AVM embolization.",2016 Jul,2016,Journal of neurosurgery,125,1,173-6,eng,False,10.3171/2015.5.JNS15145;10.3171/2015.5.JNS15145,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Adult;Embolectomy/*instrumentation;Embolization, Therapeutic/*adverse effects/methods;Enbucrilate/*adverse effects;Foreign-Body Migration/etiology/*surgery;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*therapy;Intracranial Embolism/etiology/*surgery;Male",AVM = arteriovenous malformation;DSA = digital subtraction angiography;Glubran;N-butyl-2 cyanoacrylate;NBCA = N-butyl-2 cyanoacrylate;Solitaire FR;arteriovenous malformation;bAVM = brain AVM;migration;stent retriever;vascular disorders

OBJECT: To assess our clinical experiences using a novel approach, stereoscopic virtual reality environment, to help neurosurgeons with both surgical training and surgical strategic planning purposes. METHODS: Patient-specific digital imaging data obtained from a variety of different diagnostic sources (computed tomography, computed tomographic angiography, magnetic resonance, functional magnetic resonance, magnetic resonance-diffusion tensor imaging) were collected and then transferred to a workstation setting. These clinical data were obtained from 100 patients who were suffering from either brain vascular malformations or tumors that were located in difficult brain sites. A 3-dimensional volume rendering was produced for each of the 100 clinical cases, which were then subjected to data coregistration and fusion. RESULTS: By using different head positioning systems and craniotomy options, we simulated microscopic visualizations of the lesion through numerous surgical approaches and from various angles of view. This simulation strategy enabled us to carry out an approach selection and eventually to identify the optimum angle of lesion visualization. CONCLUSION: These virtual craniotomies successfully simulated a sampling of different operative environments that have the potential to play a significant role in neurosurgical training and operative planning worthy of further exploration and development.",2010 Sep,2010,Neurosurgery,67,3 Suppl Operative,ons79-84; discussion ons84,eng,False,10.1227/01.NEU.0000383133.01993.96;10.1227/01.NEU.0000383133.01993.96,Journal Article,"Brain Diseases/*surgery;Cerebral Angiography/methods;*Computer Simulation;Female;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional/methods;Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods;Male;Microsurgery;Neuronavigation;Neurosurgical Procedures/*education/*methods;*Stereotaxic Techniques;Surgery, Computer-Assisted/*methods;Tomography, X-Ray Computed/methods",
24307995,A combination of radiosurgery and soluble tissue factor enhances vascular targeting for experimental glioblastoma.,"Radiosurgery for glioblastoma is limited to the development of resistance, allowing tumor cells to survive and initiate tumor recurrence. Based on our previous work that coadministration of tissue factor and lipopolysaccharide following radiosurgery selectively induced thrombosis in cerebral arteriovenous malformations, achieving thrombosis of 69% of the capillaries and 39% of medium sized vessels, we hypothesized that a rapid and selective shutdown of the capillaries in glioblastoma vasculature would decrease the delivery of oxygen and nutrients, reducing tumor growth, preventing intracranial hypertension, and improving life expectancy. Glioblastoma was formed by implantation of GL261 cells into C57Bl/6 mouse brain. Mice were intravenously injected tissue factor, lipopolysaccharide, a combination of both, or placebo 24 hours after radiosurgery. Control mice received both agents after sham irradiation. Coadministration of tissue factor and lipopolysaccharide led to the formation of thrombi in up to 87 ± 8% of the capillaries and 46 ± 4% of medium sized vessels within glioblastoma. The survival rate of mice in this group was 80% versus no survivor in placebo controls 30 days after irradiation. Animal body weight increased with time in this group (r = 0.88, P = 0.0001).

Moreover, few arteriovenous malformation studies report thorough neuropsychological outcome data for assessing post-surgical functioning. This case report provides a longitudinal study of a boy who initially presented for neuropsychological testing at the age of 8 years and 1 month, following polyvinyl alcohol embolization, two craniotomies and resections and stereotactic radiosurgery for a pericallosal arteriovenous malformation involving nearly all of the corpus callosum. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging also indicated absence of the left fornix. Functioning has been assessed over 7 years. Neuropsychological measures identified a consistent pattern of verbally mediated cognitive and memory deficits, with relatively spared visual perceptual and visual motor functioning. No evidence of a split-brain syndrome was found. The findings are consistent with insult to dominant hemisphere language and memory systems, provide an interesting example of neurodevelopmental compensation for significant early brain insult, and may provide insight into functions subserved by the fornix.",2001,2001,Neurocase,7,6,503-13,eng,False,10.1093/neucas/7.6.503,"Case Reports;Journal Article;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","Brain Damage, Chronic/*diagnosis/physiopathology/psychology;Child;Corpus Callosum/*blood supply/physiopathology/surgery;Dominance, Cerebral/physiology;Follow-Up Studies;Fornix, Brain/physiopathology;Humans;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery;Male;Mental Recall/physiology;Neuronal Plasticity/physiology;*Neuropsychological Tests;Postoperative Complications/*diagnosis/physiopathology/psychology;Psychomotor Performance/physiology;Reoperation;Verbal Learning/physiology",

Searching for new diagnostic and prognostic neuroimaging biomarkers, fractal-based computational models have been proposed for describing and quantifying the angioarchitecture of the nidus. Computational modeling in the AVM field offers promising tools of analysis and requires a strict collaboration among neurosurgeons, neuroradiologists, clinicians, computer scientists, and engineers.

29393755,Effect of treatment period on outcomes after stereotactic radiosurgery for brain arteriovenous malformations: an international multicenter study.,"OBJECTIVE: The role of and technique for stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in the management of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) have evolved over the past four decades. The aim of this multicenter, retrospective cohort study was to compare the SRS outcomes of AVMs treated during different time periods. METHODS: The authors selected patients with AVMs who underwent single-session SRS at 8 different centers from 1988 to 2014 with follow-up ≥ 6 months. The SRS eras were categorized as early (1988-2000) or modern (2001-2014). Statistical analyses were performed to compare the baseline characteristics and outcomes of the early versus modern SRS eras. Favorable outcome was defined as AVM obliteration, no post-SRS hemorrhage, and no permanently symptomatic radiation-induced changes (RICs). RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 2248 patients with AVMs, including 1584 in the early and 664 in the modern SRS eras. AVMs in the early SRS era were significantly smaller (p < 0.001 for maximum diameter and volume), and they were treated with a significantly higher radiosurgical margin dose (p < 0.001). The obliteration rate was significantly higher in the early SRS era (65% vs 51%, p < 0.001), and earlier SRS treatment period was an independent predictor of obliteration in the multivariate analysis (p < 0.001). The rates of post-SRS hemorrhage and radiological, symptomatic, and permanent RICs were not significantly different between the two groups. Favorable outcome was achieved in a significantly higher proportion of patients in the early SRS era (61% vs 45%, p < 0.001), but the earlier SRS era was not statistically significant in the multivariate analysis (p = 0.470) with favorable outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Despite considerable advances in SRS technology, refinement of AVM selection, and contemporary multimodality AVM treatment, the study failed to observe substantial improvements in SRS favorable outcomes or obliteration for patients with AVMs over time. Differences in baseline AVM characteristics and SRS treatment parameters may partially account for the significantly lower obliteration rates in the modern SRS era. However, improvements in patient selection and dose planning are necessary to optimize the utility of SRS in the contemporary management of AVMs.",2018 Feb 2,2018,Journal of neurosurgery,130,2,579-588,eng,True,10.3171/2017.8.JNS171336;2017.8.JNS171336;10.3171/2017.8.JNS171336,Journal Article,,Gamma Knife;intracranial arteriovenous malformation;intracranial hemorrhages;stereotactic radiosurgery;stroke;treatment period;vascular disorders
26279820,Growing Organized Hematomas Following Gamma Knife Radiosurgery for Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformation : Five Cases of Surgical Excision.,"Organized hematoma is a rare complication that can develop following gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS) for cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM). Here, we describe 5 patients with growing organized hematomas that developed from completely obliterated AVMs several years after GKS. The patients were 15, 16, 30, 36, and 38 years old at the time of GKS, respectively, and 3 patients were female. Four AVMs were located in the lobe of the brain, and the remaining AVM were in the thalamus. Between 2-12 years after GKS, patients developed progressive symptoms such intractable headache or hemiparesis and enhancing mass lesions were identified. Follow-up visits revealed the slow expansion of the hematomas and surrounding edema. Steroids were ineffective, and thus surgery was performed. Histology revealed organized hematomas with a capsule, but there was no evidence of residual AVMs or vascular malformation. After surgery, the neurological symptoms of all patients improved and the surrounding edema resolved. However, the hematoma continued to expand and intraventricular hemorrhage developed in 1 patient whose hematoma was only partially removed. GKS for cerebral AVM can be complicated by growing, organized hematomas that develop after complete obliteration. Growing hematomas should be surgically evacuated if they are symptomatic. Radical resection of the hematoma capsule is also strongly recommended.",2015 Jul,2015,Journal of Korean Neurosurgical Society,58,1,83-8,eng,False,10.3340/jkns.2015.58.1.83;10.3340/jkns.2015.58.1.83,Case Reports;Journal Article,,Gamma knife radiosurgery;Intracranial arteriovenous malformation;Intracranial hemorrhage;Surgical procedure

The primary treatment options are endovascular embolization, microsurgical resection (MS), and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). This study compares the efficacy and outcomes of MS and SRS. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, retrospective study involving patients from the MISTA database with SM Grade III BAVMs treated with MS or SRS between 2010 and 2023. Propensity matching was based on age, favorable modified Rankin Score (mRS) at presentation, nidus size, rupture status, location depth, and eloquence. RESULTS: After matching, 60 patients were equally divided between MS and SRS groups. Median age (MS: 45.0 vs. SRS: 42.5 years, p = 0.3) and AVM size (MS: 3.2 vs. SRS: 2.9 cm(3), p = 0.6) were similar. MS showed higher obliteration rates (93.3 %) compared to SRS (46.7 %) at the last follow-up (p < 0.001). The median time to obliteration post-SRS was 31.5 months (IQR: 15.3-60.0). SRS obliteration rates were 19 %, 29 %, and 59 % at 24, 36, and 60 months, respectively. Overall complication rates (MS: 30 % vs. SRS: 20 %, p = 0.4) and permanent complications (MS: 10 % vs. SRS: 13.3 %, p > 0.9) were similar. Hemorrhage occurred once in the MS group and none in the SRS (p > 0.9). Favorable outcomes (mRS 0-2) were higher with SRS than MS (93.3 % vs 80.0 %, p = 0.3), with one AVM-related mortality in the MS group. CONCLUSION: MS and SRS are viable treatments for SM Grade III BAVMs. Treatment choice should be individualized by a multidisciplinary team, considering patient goals.",2024 Dec 3,2024,Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,249,,108669,eng,True,S0303-8467(24)00556-0;10.1016/j.clineuro.2024.108669;S0303-8467(24)00556-0;10.1016/j.clineuro.2024.108669,Journal Article,,AVM obliteration;Cerebral arteriovenous malformations;Complication rates and functional outcomes;Resection;Spetzler-Martin Grade III;Stereotactic radiosurgery
39335517,Considerations for the Use of Stereotactic Radiosurgery to Treat Large Arteriovenous Malformations.,"Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is an effective treatment strategy for cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Aggressive treatment achieving complete obliteration is necessary to prevent further intracranial hemorrhage and neurological deficits. However, SRS treatment of large AVMs (>10 cm(3)) is challenging. To prevent toxicity in the normal brain tissue, it is imperative to reduce the radiation dose as the lesion volume increases; however, this also reduces the rate of obliteration.

We report a patient with a large AVM in the eloquent area, and brain edema developed in this area after repeat Gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery (GKRS). An 18-year-old female presented with a 4-year-history of persistent headache. Magnetic resonance imaging and transfemoral carotid angiogram revealed a high-flow large AVM in the left parieto-occipital area. Brain edema developed and aggravated patient's symptoms after time-staged GKRS. The cause of edema was thought to be the failure of the surrounding venous channels to drain the venous flow from the normal brain and the drainage was hampered by the persistent shunt flow from the AVM, which was due to the thrombosis of one huge draining vein of the AVM. The microsurgical resection of the AVM nidus eliminated shunt flow and completely normalized the brain edema.

31470409,The impact of preradiosurgery embolization on intracranial arteriovenous malformations: a matched cohort analysis based on de novo lesion volume.,"OBJECTIVE: The benefits and risks of pre-stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) embolization have been reported in different studies. The goal of this study was to compare the long-term outcome of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) treated with and without pre-SRS embolization. METHODS: A database including 1159 patients with AVMs who underwent SRS was reviewed. The embolized group was selected by including AVMs with pre-SRS embolization, maximal diameter > 30 mm, and estimated volume > 8 ml. The nonembolized group was defined as AVMs treated by SRS alone with matched de novo nidus volume. Outcomes including incidences of favorable clinical outcome (obliteration without hemorrhage, cyst formation, worsening, or new seizures), obliteration, adverse effects, and angioarchitectural complexity were evaluated. RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 17 patients in the embolized group (median AVM volume 17.0 ml) and 35 patients in the nonembolized group (median AVM volume 13.1 ml). The rates of obliteration (embolized cohort: 33%, 44%, and 56%; nonembolized cohort: 32%, 47%, and 47% at 4, 6, and 10 years, respectively) and favorable outcome were comparable between the 2 groups. However, the embolized group had a significantly higher incidence of repeat SRS (41% vs 23%, p = 0.012) and total procedures (median number of procedures 4 vs 1, p < 0.001), even with a significantly higher margin dose delivered at the first SRS (23 Gy vs 17 Gy, p < 0.001). The median angioarchitectural complexity score was reduced from 7 to 5 after embolization. Collateral flow and neovascularization were more frequently observed in the embolized nonobliterated AVMs. CONCLUSIONS: Both embolization plus SRS and SRS alone were effective therapies for moderately large (8-39 ml) AVMs. Even with a significantly higher prescription dose at the time of initial SRS, the embolized group still required more procedures to reach final obliteration. The presence of collateral flow and neovascularization could be risk factors for a failure to obliterate following treatment.",2020 Oct 1,2020,Journal of neurosurgery,133,4,1156-1167,eng,False,10.3171/2019.5.JNS19722;2019.5.JNS19722;10.3171/2019.5.JNS19722,Journal Article,,Gamma Knife radiosurgery;embolization;intracranial;large arteriovenous malformation;stereotactic radiosurgery;vascular disorders
31819462,Gamma Knife Radiosurgery For Brain Vascular Malformations: Current Evidence And Future Tasks.,"Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) has long been used for treating brain vascular malformations, including arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs), and cavernous malformations (CMs). Herein, current evidence and controversies regarding the role of stereotactic radiosurgery for vascular malformations are described. 1) It has already been established that GKRS achieves 70-85% obliteration rates after a 3-5-year latency period for small to medium-sized AVMs. However, late radiation-induced adverse events (RAEs) including cyst formation, encapsulated hematoma, and tumorigenesis have recently been recognized, and the associated risks, clinical courses, and outcomes are under investigation. SRS-based therapeutic strategies for relatively large AVMs, including staged GKRS and a combination of GKRS and embolization, continue to be developed, though their advantages and disadvantages warrant further investigation. The role of GKRS in managing unruptured AVMs remains controversial since a prospective trial showed no benefit of treatment, necessitating further consideration of this issue. 2) Regarding DAVFs, GKRS achieves 41-90% obliteration rates at the second post-GKRS year with a hemorrhage rate below 5%. Debate continues as to whether GKRS might serve as a first-line solo therapeutic modality given its latency period. Although the post-GKRS outcomes are thought to differ among lesion locations, further outcome analyses regarding DAVF locations are required. 3) GKRS is generally accepted as an alternative for small or medium-sized CMs in which surgery is considered to be too risky. The reported hemorrhage rates ranged from 0.5-5% after GKRS. Higher dose treatments (>15 Gy) were performed during the learning curve, while, with the current standard treatment, a dose range of 12-15 Gy is generally selected, and has resulted in acceptable complication rates (< 5%). Nevertheless, further elucidation of long-term outcomes is essential.",2019,2019,Therapeutics and clinical risk management,15,,1351-1367,eng,False,10.2147/TCRM.S200813;200813;10.2147/TCRM.S200813,Journal Article;Review,,arteriovenous malformation;cavernous malformation;dural arteriovenous fistula;gamma knife radiosurgery;stereotactic radiosurgery
19893730,Radiosurgical considerations in the treatment of large cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVE: In order to establish the role of Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKS) in large intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), we analyzed clinical characteristics, radiological features, and radiosurgical outcomes. METHODS: Between March 1992 and March 2005, 28 of 33 patients with large AVMs (> 10 cm(3) in nidus-volume) who were treated with GKS underwent single session radiosurgery (RS), and the other 5 patients underwent staged volumetric RS. Retrospectively collected data were available in 23 cases. We analyzed treatment outcomes in each subdivided groups and according to the AVM sizes. We compared the estimated volume, defined as primarily estimated nidus volume using MR images, with real target volume after excluding draining veins and feeding arteries embedded into the nidus. RESULTS: Regarding those patients who underwent single session RS, 44.4% (8/18) had complete obliteration; regarding staged volumetric RS, the obliteration rate was 40% (2/5). The complete obliteration rate was 60% (6/10) in the smaller nidus group (10-15 cm(3) size), and 25% (2/8) in the larger nidus group (over 15 cm(3) size). One case of cerebral edema and two cases (8.7%) of hemorrhage were seen during the latent period. The mean real target volume for 18 single sessions of RS was 17.1 cm(3) (10.1-38.4 cm(3)), in contrast with the mean estimated volume of 20.9 cm(3) (12.0-45.0 cm(3)). CONCLUSION: The radiosurgical treatment outcomes of large AVMs are generally poor. However, we presume that the recent development in planning software and imaging devices aid more accurate measurement of the nidus volume, therefore improving the treatment outcome.",2009 Oct,2009,Journal of Korean Neurosurgical Society,46,4,378-84,eng,False,10.3340/jkns.2009.46.4.378;10.3340/jkns.2009.46.4.378,Journal Article,,Arteriovenous Malformation;Complication;Gamma Knife radiosurgery;Intracerebral Hemorrhage;Obliteration;Outcome

Computed tomography showed a small intraventricular hemorrhage in the left lateral ventricle. Cerebral angiograms suggested rupture of a coexisting feeder aneurysm in the left temporal cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM). The left proximal middle cerebral artery, a major feeding artery, was occluded near the AVM, with development of abnormal blood supply, such as in moyamoya-like vessels to the nidus. After endovascular embolization of the coexisting feeder aneurysm and feeding arteries, the patient underwent volume-staged Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKS).

However, there was limited evidence comparing frame-based and frameless SRS for intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVM). We aimed to compare the treatment outcomes between frame-based and frameless LINAC SRS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort compared the outcomes of frame-based LINAC SRS (1998-2009) with frameless LINAC SRS (2010-2020). The primary outcome was the obliteration rate. The other outcomes included the neurological, radiological, and functional outcomes after SRS. A matched cohort was identified by propensity scores for further comparisons. RESULTS: A total of 65 patients were included with a mean follow-up time of 13.2 years (158.5 months). There were 40 patients in the frame-based group and 25 patients in the frameless group. The overall obliteration rate was comparable (Frame-based 82.5% vs Frameless 80.0%, p = 0.310) and not significantly different over time (log-rank p = 0.536). The crude post-SRS hemorrhage rate was 1.5% and the incidence was 0.3 per 100 person-years. There were 67.7% of patients with AVM obliteration without new persistent neurological deficits at the last visit and 56.9% of patients with AVM obliteration without any deficits (transient or persistent) during the entire follow-up period. Four patients (8.0%) developed late onset persistent adverse radiation effects (more than 96 months after SRS) among 50 patients with more than 8-year surveillance. In the propensity-matched cohort of 42 patients, there was no significant difference in AVM obliteration (Frame-based vs Frameless, log-rank p = 0.984). CONCLUSION: Frameless and frame-based LINAC SRS have comparable efficacy in intracranial AVM obliteration.

This study aims to investigate and compare the effectiveness and safety profile of the 2 newer liquid embolic agents in the embolization of cerebral AVM. This is a retrospective study on all patients diagnosed with cerebral AVM undergoing endovascular embolization with liquid embolic agents PHIL and Squid admitted to the Division of Neurosurgery, Department of Surgery in Prince of Wales Hospital from January 2014 to June 2021. Twenty-three patients with cerebral AVM were treated with 34 sessions of endovascular embolization with either PHIL or Squid (17 sessions each) liquid embolic agents with a male to female ratio of 2.3:1 (male 16; female 7) and mean age of 44.6 (range, 12 to 67). The mean total nidus obliteration rate per session was 57% (range, 5% to 100%). Twenty-one patients (91.3%) received further embolization, stereotactic radiosurgery, or surgical excision after initial endovascular embolization. There were 2 morbidities (1 neurological and 1 non-neurological, 6%) and no mortalities (0%). All patients had static or improvement in modified Rankin Scale at 3 to 6 months at discharge.

35855079,Results of surgical treatment after Gamma Knife radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations: patient series.,"BACKGROUND: Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) is a safe and effective treatment, but it has a risk of bleeding. Herein, the authors describe their experience with some patients who required surgical removal of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) located mainly in eloquent areas of the brain after GKRS, and they consider the advantages of surgical removal after GKRS. OBSERVATIONS: Twelve patients who had undergone surgical removal of AVMs after GKRS at Tokyo Women's Medical University between April 2013 and July 2019 were selected for analysis. All participants underwent GKRS as first-line therapy for AVMs located in an eloquent region or if requested by the patient. Complete obliteration was achieved in 7 patients, and the size of the nidus decreased in 3 patients during the follow-up period. The Spetzler-Martin grade decreased in 11 patients. Three patients experienced symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage before and after confirmation of complete obliteration of the nidus via GKRS, and 7 patients experienced some neurological deficits because of an encapsulated expanding hematoma. All patients underwent resection of the nidus without complications. The preoperative neurological deficits improved in 6 patients and remained unchanged in 6 patients.

39777180,Efficacy of radiosurgery with and without angioembolization: A subgroup analysis of effectiveness in ruptured versus unruptured arteriovenous malformations - An updated systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Congenital arterial defects such as cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) increase brain bleeding risk. Conservative therapy, microsurgical removal, percutaneous embolization, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), or a combination may treat this serious disease. This study compares angioembolization with SRS to SRS alone in ruptured or unruptured brain ateriovenous malformations (BAVM) patients. METHODS: We followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses recommendations for this study. Until September 2023, PubMed/Medline, Cochrane, and Clinicaltrials.gov were searched for literature. English-language studies comparing SRS alone to embolization with SRS on ruptured or non-ruptured AVMs that could not be operated on were considered. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale assessed research study quality. RESULTS: Results included 46 studies with a total of 7077 participants. There was a greater obliteration rate in the SRS-only group (60.4%) than in the embolization plus SRS group (49.73%). Particularly in the SRS-only group, ruptured AVMs showed a noticeably greater obliteration rate than unruptured AVMs (P = 0.002). However, no notable differences were found in hemorrhagic events or radiation-induced changes between the two groups; however, the SRS-only group had a slightly greater, yet not statistically significant, mortality rate. CONCLUSION: Our data showed that ruptured brain AVMs had a much greater obliteration rate than unruptured ones, mostly due to SRS alone, without embolization. The aggregated data showed no significant changes, whereas SRS alone decreased radiation-induced alterations and hemorrhagic rates but with increased mortality. SRS alone may have a higher risk-to-reward ratio for nidus obliteration in ruptured brain AVM patients, so it should be used without embolization, although more research is needed to determine the effects of immediate and late complications.",2024,2024,Surgical neurology international,15,,467,eng,False,10.25259/SNI_737_2024;467;10.25259/SNI_737_2024;10.25259/SNI_737_2024,Journal Article;Review,,Angioembolization;Cerebral arteriovenous malformations;Hemorrhagic events;Obliteration rate;Radiation-induced changes;Stereotactic radiosurgery
38201331,Machine Learning Approach for Analyzing 3-Year Outcomes of Patients with Brain Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM) after Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS).,"A cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a tangle of abnormal blood vessels that irregularly connects arteries and veins. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has been shown to be an effective treatment for AVM patients, but the factors associated with AVM obliteration remains a matter of debate. In this study, we aimed to develop a model that can predict whether patients with AVM will be cured 36 months after intervention by means of SRS and identify the most important predictors that explain the probability of being cured. A machine learning (ML) approach was applied using decision tree (DT) and logistic regression (LR) techniques on historical data (sociodemographic, clinical, treatment, angioarchitecture, and radiosurgery procedure) of 202 patients with AVM who underwent SRS at the Instituto de Radiocirugía del Perú (IRP) between 2005 and 2018. The LR model obtained the best results for predicting AVM cure with an accuracy of 0.92, sensitivity of 0.93, specificity of 0.89, and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.98, which shows that ML models are suitable for predicting the prognosis of medical conditions such as AVM and can be a support tool for medical decision-making. In addition, several factors were identified that could explain whether patients with AVM would be cured at 36 months with the highest likelihood: the location of the AVM, the occupation of the patient, and the presence of hemorrhage.",2023 Dec 22,2023,"Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)",14,1,,eng,False,10.3390/diagnostics14010022;22;diagnostics14010022;diagnostics-14-00022;10.3390/diagnostics14010022,Journal Article,,artificial intelligence;brain arteriovenous malformation;decision tree;logistic regression;machine learning;prediction;prognosis
36590065,Microenvironment changes in arteriovenous malformations after stereotactic radiation.,"Cerebral arteriovenous malformations are dysplastic vascular tangles with aberrant vascular dynamics and can result significant morbidity and mortality. A myriad of challenges are encountered when treating these lesions and are largely based on nidal size, location, and prior hemorrhage. Currently, stereotactic radiosurgery is an accepted form of treatment for small to medium sized lesions and is especially useful in the treatment of lesions in non-surgically assessable eloquent areas of the brain. Despite overall high rates of nidal obliteration, there is relatively limited understand on the mechanisms that drive the inflammatory and obliterative pathways observed after treatment with stereotactic radiosurgery.

33500815,Bibliometric analysis of the top-100 most cited articles on the radiosurgical management of cerebral arteriovenous malformation.,"BACKGROUND: Radiosurgery is an effective, alternative treatment modality in managing patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). The present study aims to highlight the scholarly impact of the top-100 most cited articles on the radiosurgical management of AVMs. METHODS: A title-specific search using the keyword ""arteriovenous malformation"" was conducted in the Scopus database. The outcome of the search was rearranged based on the citations count. Articles were categorized into four entities; clinical, gamma knife radiosurgery, linear accelerator (LINAC) radiosurgery, and proton beam radiosurgery. The exclusion criteria were applied to spinal or non-intracranial AVM, conference papers, non-English articles predominantly discussing the endovascular or microsurgical management. RESULTS: The top-100 articles on the radiosurgical management of AVM were published between 1972 and 2016. Approximately one-third of the publications were produced between 1995 and 2000. The average citations per year for all papers were seven. The most-studied entity was pertinent to the clinical application of gamma knife radiosurgery in AVM (68%). The United States was the most active country in studying the radiosurgical application in AVM. The Journal of Neurosurgery published approximately one-third of the most-cited articles in the list. The top-3 most contributing authors, publishing 80% of articles in the list, were Lunsford et al. CONCLUSION: The radiosurgical management of AVMs evolved significantly throughout the years.

30538891,Selective and super-selective C-arm based cone beam CT angiography (CBCTA) with DynaCT for CyberKnife radiosurgery planning of intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs).,"BACKGROUND: Successful radiosurgery for intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) requires accurate delineation of the nidus in 3D. Exact targeting and precise equipment is needed to achieve obliteration of the nidus while minimizing toxicity to the surrounding brain. In some micro-AVMs and poorly visible AVMs we have used cone beam CT angiography (CBCTA) with selective and super-selective angiography where a micro-catheter is advanced into the feeding arteries- to assist with nidus definition for CyberKnife radiosurgery planning. METHODS: Four patients who had AVMs inadequately visualized with MRI, MRA, CT, CTA, and dynamic CT angiography (dCTA) were identified for selective angiography (2 had super-selective angiography) for CyberKnife radiosurgery. The mean age at the time of treatment was 45 years (range: 22 - 71 years). All patients had suffered prior hemorrhage and were deemed inoperable. Super-selective angiography was done under general anesthesia to minimize motion artefact and the risk of arterial dissection. Angiography was performed using the biplane angiographic suite (ArtisQ; Siemens). Cone beam reconstructions were performed using DynaCT software. For each scan, volumetric data was acquired over 20 seconds in a single rotation of the C-arm mounted flat-panel detector cone-beam CT system. The data set was imported into the CyberKnife TPS and co-registered with the treatment planning CT, T2 MRI and Toshiba dCTA. Delineation of the AVM nidus was performed by the multi-disciplinary AVM team. RESULTS: There were no adverse events related to the angiography or radiosurgery treatment. CBCTA data sets created using DynaCT were accurately co-registered with the treatment planning scans in the CyberKnife treatment planning system (Multiplan). For all 4 patients, feeding arteries, draining veins and nidi were clearly visualized and used to develop radiosurgery plans. Mean nidus size was 0.45cc (range: 0.07 - 1.00cc). CONCLUSIONS: For intracranial micro-AVMs and AVMs otherwise poorly visualized using DSA, MRA, CTA or dCTA, selective and super-selective CBCTA images (created using DynaCT) can be successfully imported into the CyberKnife TPS to assist in nidus delineation. Advancement of a micro-catheter into the feeding arteries to allow continuous contrast injection during volumetric scanning constitutes super-selective CBCTA. This technique provides superior visualization of micro-AVMs and should be utilized for radiosurgery planning of poorly visualized AVMs.",2018,2018,Journal of radiosurgery and SBRT,5,4,305-313,eng,False,RSBRT-5-313,Journal Article,,C-arm based cone beam CT angiography (CBCT-A);CyberKnife radiosurgery;arteriovenous malformations;intracranial arteriovenous malformation;radiosurgery;selective angiography

CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 20-year-old woman at 18 weeks of gestation presented with right cerebral hemorrhage and underwent urgent evacuation of the hematoma. She recovered well after surgery, but cerebral angiography after the surgery revealed a small deeply seated arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in the right frontal lobe extending to the right basal ganglia. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined the diffuse AVM and treated it with LINAC-based SRS at 24 weeks of gestation. Before SRS, the fetus was exposed to a radiation dose of 8.26 mGy, which was estimated by conducting an experiment using an adult RANDO phantom, and a radiophotoluminescent (RPL) glass rod dosimeter (GRD) system. The patient underwent Caesarean delivery at 36 weeks of gestation and gave birth to a healthy baby. CONCLUSION: The exposure of fetus to radiation during SRS was exceedingly low. SRS can be used as an alternative treatment to microsurgery for resolving small deeply seated AVMs even in pregnant patients.",2010 Jul,2010,Asian journal of neurosurgery,5,2,73-7,eng,False,AJNS-5-73,Case Reports;Journal Article,,cerebral arteriovenous malformation;fetus exposure to radiation;linear accelerator-based stereotactic radiosurgery;pregnancy
34712200,Stereotactic Radiosurgery With vs. Without Prior Embolization for Brain Arteriovenous Malformations: A Propensity Score Matching Analysis.,"Objective: Whether partial embolization could facilitate the post-stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) obliteration for brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) remains controversial. We performed this study to compare the outcomes of SRS with and without prior embolization for bAVMs. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the Beijing Tiantan AVMs prospective registration research database from September 2011 to October 2014. Patients were categorized into two groups, combined upfront embolization and SRS (Em+SRS group) and SRS alone (SRS group), and we performed a propensity score matching analysis based on pre-embolization baseline characteristics; the matched groups each comprised 76 patients. Results: The obliteration rate was similar between SRS and Em+SRS (44.7 vs. 31.6%; OR, 1.754; 95% CI, 0.905-3.401; p = 0.096). However, the SRS group was superior to the Em+SRS group in terms of cumulative obliteration rate at a follow-up of 5 years (HR,1.778; 95% CI, 1.017-3.110; p = 0.033). The secondary outcomes, including functional state, post-SRS hemorrhage, all-cause mortality, and edema or cyst formation were similar between the matched cohorts. In the ruptured subgroup, the SRS group could achieve higher obliteration rate than Em+SRS group (56.5 vs. 31.9%; OR, 2.773; 95% CI, 1.190-6.464; p = 0.018). The cumulative obliteration rate at 5 years was also higher in the SRS group (64.5 vs. 41.3%; HR, 2.012; 95% CI, 1.037-3.903; p = 0.038), and the secondary outcomes were also similar between the matched cohorts. Conclusion: Although there was no significant difference in the overall obliteration rate between the two strategies, this study suggested that pre-SRS embolization may have a negative effect on post-SRS obliteration. Furthermore, the obliteration rates of the SRS only strategy was significantly higher than that of the Em+SRS strategy in the ruptured cohort, while no such phenomenon was found in the unruptured cohort.",2021,2021,Frontiers in neurology,12,,752164,eng,True,10.3389/fneur.2021.752164;752164;10.3389/fneur.2021.752164,Journal Article,,brain arteriovenous malformation;hemorrhage;obliteration;partial embolization;stereotactic radiosurgery

A team of five clinicians examined the demographic, clinical, and radiological details of each patient at baseline and reached a consensus on the best first-line treatment for bAVMs. Their treatment choice was used to train an automated supervised ML (autoML) model to select treatments for bAVMs for the training dataset. The accuracy and AUC of the algorithm in selecting the treatment strategy were measured for the test dataset, and feature importance scores of the included variables were calculated. RESULTS: Among the 100,000 combinations of supervised ML algorithms and their hyperparameters attempted by autoML, gradient boosting classifier had the best predictive performance with an overall accuracy of 0.74 and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88. The treatment-specific accuracies were 0.96, 0.85, 0.84, and 0.82; and AUCs were 0.75, 0.95, 0.80, and 0.88 for medical management, surgery, endovascular embolization, and gamma-knife radiosurgery, respectively. Spetzler-Martin score, followed by eloquent AVM location and AVM size, were the three most important features in determining treatments. CONCLUSION: ML could reliably select the best first-line treatment strategy for bAVMs as per multidisciplinary expert consensus. This study can be replicated for larger population-based AVM registries, with the inclusion of outcome data, thus helping address the bias involved in the management of unruptured bAVMs.",2024 Dec 8,2024,Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,249,,108681,eng,False,S0303-8467(24)00568-7;10.1016/j.clineuro.2024.108681;S0303-8467(24)00568-7;10.1016/j.clineuro.2024.108681,Journal Article,,Automated machine learning;Brain arteriovenous malformations;Clinical consensus;Machine learning;Therapeutic strategy

36120229,Frameless Co-Registration of Biplane 2D Digital Subtraction Angiography Whole Frames and 3D Rotational Angiography-Based Cone-Beam Computed Tomography Angiogram on Dedicated Software for Stereotactic Radiosurgery of Cranial Vascular Malformations.,"PURPOSE: Given its high spatial resolution and vasculature selectivity, the cone-beam computed tomography (CT) angiography (CBCTA) image acquired by selective 3D rotational angiography (3DRA) is the most suitable 3D image for the target definition of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs). Furthermore, the relatively low temporal resolution of 3DRA-based CBCTA can be complemented by the stereotactic co-registration of orthogonally paired 2D dynamic digital subtraction angiography (2D-DSA). The integration of 2D-DSA, which is usually limited to one or a few frames for each projection, into CBCTA and/or planning CT can be achieved only by catheter-directed angiography on the day of SRS via a dedicated image localizer under rigid frame fixation to the skull, which imposes substantial burdens on patients. This study aimed to demonstrate a novel, convenient, and significantly less invasive method for the frameless co-registration of biplane 2D-DSA whole frames and CBCTA on commercially available dedicated software, namely, Brainlab(®) Elements (Brainlab AG, Munich, Germany), and present its prerequisite for successful image fusion. Technical Report: Elements have afforded the following functionality: A 3D vasculature image is automatically extracted as a floating image from any 3D image series containing vascular details and then subsequently co-registered manually and automatically to a selected frame pair of 2D-DSA with a six-degree-of-freedom rigid registration. As a preclinical feasibility study, two anonymous image datasets from patients harboring cerebral AVM and transverse-sigmoid (TS) DAVF were used to verify the accuracy and practicality of Elements for the frameless co-registration of 2D/3D vascular images, particularly on the assumption of clinical workflow for the target delineation of SRS planning. The use of ordinary unsubtracted CBCTA resulted in the insufficient extraction of abutting vessels or vessels that are in close proximity to bony structures, particularly in the case of TS-DAVF, where the fistulous pouch and the affected venous sinuses were adjacent to the cranial bone. By contrast, the amount and selectivity of vasculatures and the accuracy of subsequent image fusion were significantly improved from the subtracted CBCTA. The integration of CBCTA into dynamic 2D-DSA allowed the simultaneous review of both image information by sharing any concerning point and 2D or 3D structures under a common 3D coordinate. CONCLUSIONS: Elements enable the clinically useful frameless co-registration of biplane 2D-DSA whole frames into CBCTA, for which the routine acquisition of both subtracted and unsubtracted CBCTA axial images for ordinary diagnostic purposes is an indispensable prerequisite for successful image fusion and further widespread application. This frameless integration of the 2D/3D angiogram would dramatically enhance both the frame-based and frameless SRS workflow and circumstances by allowing users to forward SRS planning well in advance before SRS, along with the omission of invasive angiography on the day of SRS, and would broaden the implementation of frameless SRS. Furthermore, the comprehensive alternating interactive review of the 2D/3D integrated angiogram leads to a more in-depth quasi-4D understanding of the affected angioarchitectures compared with the separate viewing of each image.",2022 Aug,2022,Cureus,14,8,e27983,eng,False,10.7759/cureus.27983;e27983;10.7759/cureus.27983,Journal Article,,3d rotational angiography;arteriovenous malformation;cone-beam computed tomography angiogram;digital subtraction angiogram;dural arteriovenous fistula;frameless;image co-registration;less invasive;stereotactic radiosurgery
35673645,Stereotactic radiosurgery for ruptured versus unruptured intracranial arteriovenous malformations.,"BACKGROUND: There are a limited data examining the effects of prior hemorrhage on outcomes after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). The goal of this study was to identify risk factors for arteriovenous malformation (AVM) rupture and compare outcomes, including post-SRS hemorrhage, between patients presenting with ruptured and unruptured AVMs. METHODS: A retrospective review of consecutive patients undergoing SRS for intracranial AVMs between 2009 and 2019 at our institution was conducted. Chi-square and multivariable logistic regression analyses were utilized to identify patient and AVM factors associated with AVM rupture at presentation and outcomes after SRS including the development of recurrent hemorrhage in both ruptured and unruptured groups. RESULTS: Of 210 consecutive patients with intracranial AVMs treated with SRS, 73 patients (34.8%) presented with AVM rupture. Factors associated with AVM rupture included smaller AVM diameter, deep venous drainage, cerebellar location, and the presence of intranidal aneurysms (P < 0.05). In 188 patients with adequate follow-up time (mean 42.7 months), the overall post-SRS hemorrhage rate was 8.5% and was not significantly different between ruptured and unruptured groups (10.3 vs. 7.5%, P = 0.51). There were no significant differences in obliteration rate, time to obliteration, or adverse effects requiring surgery or steroids between unruptured and ruptured groups. CONCLUSION: Smaller AVM size, deep venous drainage, and associated intranidal aneurysms were associated with rupture at presentation. AVM rupture at presentation was not associated with an increased risk of recurrent hemorrhage or other complication after SRS when compared to unruptured AVM presentation. Obliteration rates were similar between ruptured and unruptured groups.",2022,2022,Surgical neurology international,13,,194,eng,True,10.25259/SNI_86_2022;194;10.25259/SNI_86_2022;10.25259/SNI_86_2022,Journal Article,,Arteriovenous malformation;Post-radiosurgery hemorrhage;Rupture;Stereotactic radiosurgery
28652950,Highlights on Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformation Treatment Using Combined Embolization and Stereotactic Radiosurgery: Why Outcomes are Controversial?,"Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are abnormal tangling between brain arteries and veins causing an arteriovenous shunt called nidus with an intervening network of vessels from the region of formation and spans through the brain. AVM effect is debilitating to the affected individual due to associated persistent intracerebral hemorrhage, resulting in significant occurrences of seizures and neurological damage. Recent innovative treatments involve a combination of embolization (Embo) procedures followed by stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), designed to optimize less-invasive practice for the obliteration of the AVMs. Three groups of investigators reported different outcomes based on obliteration rates and adverse events, making the effectiveness of options for therapy, controversial. We have taken the case-oriented-approach to highlight on varying outcomes from various studies and provide insights as to why findings from different operation settings could be so conflicting. We chose 18 articles for systematic analysis based on initial electronic database selection of 40 key papers already identified for inclusion, followed by independent blinding assessment by two co-authors. Our evaluation was based first on our specific inclusion criteria, examining method quality, obliteration rates, serious adverse events (SAEs) and mortality rates. Second, we made a comparison between SRS or embo alone treatments versus combined embo/SRS procedures, relative to AVM sizes, following Spetzler-Martin (SM) method. Third, we considered publications which had concrete statistics with well-defined P-values and clarified outcomes for accurate evaluation. We found that patients with small to medium-sized AVM were susceptible to either embo alone or SRS alone treatments, yielding obliteration rates from 71%-100%. Except for one report, giant sizes AVMs were not amenable to these single treatments, subjecting patients to embo/SRS procedures, which yielded mixed results: One group reported 52%-65% obliteration rates, compared to 23%-28% embo alone treatment. A second group contradicted this apparent beneficial outcome, obtaining obliteration rates of 53% with combined treatment compared to 71% with SRS alone, four-year postoperative. A third group reported there was no difference between single and combined treatments and obtained complete obliteration of 70%-82%, ranging from three-five-years postoperative follow-up. In all the cases analyzed, obliteration rates improved with time. SAEs, such as persistent hemorrhage and permanent neurologic deficits (P-NDs), as well as mortality, were minimal during intraoperative and postoperative follow-ups. The problem of conflicting outcomes in combined treatments of AVM by EMBO/SRS exists. Previous investigators, however, have overlooked to address this issue satisfactorily. Our analysis found that the reported inconsistencies in AVM treatment outcomes are attributable to key factors making therapy unpredictable, which includes: the size of the AVM, nidus localization and accessibility of either Embo or radiation dose applied, certain Embo materials lowering obliteration rates by masking radioactive effect on the nidus during SRS and follow-up timing for obtaining obliteration rates determine the extent of obliteration. We have indicated critical factors which require consideration when planning strategies for treatment of AVM patients and have made suggestions of how to overcome such hurdles.",2017 May 22,2017,Cureus,9,5,e1266,eng,False,10.7759/cureus.1266;e1266;10.7759/cureus.1266,Journal Article;Review,,arteriovenous malformations (avms);combined embolization and stereotactic radiosurgery (embo/srs);controversial outcomes;setbacks
27430471,Endovascular treatment of arteriovenous malformations.,"Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM) are tangles of blood vessels that permit shunting of blood from the arterial to venous phase without intervening capillaries. The malformation's arterialization of a low-pressure system creates a risk of rupture that is substantially higher when associated with an aneurysm. The annual hemorrhage rate is 2.2% per year as reported in the randomized trial of unruptured brain AVMs (ARUBA; rupture risk is increased after the first event. Ruptured AVMs have a 10% mortality rate and 20%-30% morbidity rate. The treatment of choice for AVMs is microvascular resection with or without preoperative embolization. Surgical risk can be stratified based on the Spetzler-Martin grading system. Liquid embolic material and coils may be used for the treatment of AVM associated aneurysms, especially in the setting of acute rupture as a bridge to delayed surgical resection. There is some limited reported success in total endovascular treatment of AVMs, but this is not considered standard therapy at this time. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has been recently described but mainly limited to AMVs deemed too risky to approach in an open fashion and limited to 2.5cm-3cm in size. The delayed protection from hemorrhage (approximately 2-3 years) and high marginal failure/recurrence rate are the greatest concerns.",2016,2016,Handbook of clinical neurology,136,,1311-7,eng,False,B978-0-444-53486-6.00068-5;10.1016/B978-0-444-53486-6.00068-5;B978-0-444-53486-6.00068-5;10.1016/B978-0-444-53486-6.00068-5,Journal Article;Review,Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnostic imaging/*therapy;Endovascular Procedures/*methods;Humans;Neuroimaging,Arteriovenous malformation;Spetzler-Martin;flow-related aneurysm;microsurgical resection;stereotactic radiosurgery
26889274,Comparing monomodality treatments of low-grade intracranial arteriovenous malformation at Hospital Kuala Lumpur between 2008 and 2011: A retrospective study.,"INTRODUCTION: Intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of Spetzler-Martin grades (SMGs) I-III are treated using either monomodality treatments of microsurgical excision, embolization or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), or a combination of two or more of these treatment options. At Hospital Kuala Lumpur, we still practice monomodality treatments for AVMs of these three grades. In this study, we wanted to achieve an understanding whether monomodality treatments can achieve a satisfactory outcome of AVM nidi for patients, for up to 3 years, and to gather an objective data for AVM treatment for the Malaysian population. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective review of records study. The data are acquired from case notes of patients with intracranial AVM of SMGs I to III who underwent monomodality treatment at Hospital Kuala Lumpur between 2008 and 2011. The patients were followed up with imaging for up to 3 years from the date of treatment. A total of 81 patients were recruited in this study, where 30 underwent microsurgical treatment, 27 underwent embolization, and 24 underwent SRS. RESULTS: Total obliteration of AVM nidus was achieved in 96.7% of patients who underwent microsurgery, 8.7% of patients who underwent embolization, and 79.2% of patients who underwent SRS. The modified Rankin scale (mRS) for all three groups showed an improving trend, with the microsurgery group showing the best improvement (from 70% at 3 months to 92.3% at 3 years showing favorable mRS scores). CONCLUSIONS: The AVM nidus obliteration for each treatment group is comparable to the meta-analysis published in 2011. Each modality had its own set of complications; however, most of the patients in all three groups had either static or improved mRS at the end of the 3-year follow-up.",2016 Jan-Mar,2016,Asian journal of neurosurgery,11,1,22-8,eng,False,10.4103/1793-5482.172595;AJNS-11-22;10.4103/1793-5482.172595,Journal Article,,Arteriovenous malformation;Malaysia;embolization;microsurgery;stereotactic radiosurgery

25414830,A multicenter retrospective study of frameless robotic radiosurgery for intracranial arteriovenous malformation.,"INTRODUCTION: CT-guided, frameless radiosurgery is an alternative treatment to traditional catheter-angiography targeted, frame-based methods for intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Despite the widespread use of frameless radiosurgery for treating intracranial tumors, its use for treating AVM is not-well described. METHODS: Patients who completed a course of single fraction radiosurgery at The University of North Carolina or Georgetown University between 4/1/2005-4/1/2011 with single fraction radiosurgery and received at least one follow-up imaging study were included. All patients received pre-treatment planning with CTA ± MRA and were treated on the CyberKnife (Accuray) radiosurgery system. Patients were evaluated for changes in clinical symptoms and radiographic changes evaluated with MRI/MRA and catheter-angiography. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients, 15 male and 11 female, were included in the present study at a median age of 41 years old. The Spetzler-Martin grades of the AVMs included seven Grade I, 12 Grade II, six Grade III, and one Grade IV with 14 (54%) of the patients having a pre-treatment hemorrhage. Median AVM nidal volume was 1.62 cm(3) (0.57-8.26 cm(3)) and was treated with a median dose of 1900 cGy to the 80% isodose line. At median follow-up of 25 months, 15 patients had a complete closure of their AVM, 6 patients had a partial closure, and 5 patients were stable. Time since treatment was a significant predictor of response, with patients experience complete closure having on average 11 months more follow-up than patients with partial or no closure (p = 0.03). One patient experienced a post-treatment hemorrhage at 22 months. CONCLUSION: Frameless radiosurgery can be targeted with non-invasive MRI/MRA and CTA imaging. Despite the difficulty of treating AVM without catheter angiography, early results with frameless, CT-guided radiosurgery suggest that it can achieve similar results to frame-based methods at these time points.",2014,2014,Frontiers in oncology,4,,298,eng,False,10.3389/fonc.2014.00298;298;10.3389/fonc.2014.00298,Journal Article,,CT angiography;arteriovenous malformations;image guided radiation therapy;outcomes;stereotactic radiosurgery
39159500,Timing of diffusion tensor imaging in the management of a ruptured pediatric arteriovenous malformation: illustrative case.,"BACKGROUND: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can characterize eloquent white matter tracts affected by brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). However, DTI interpretation can be difficult in ruptured cases due to the presence of blood products. The authors present the case of a ruptured pediatric AVM in the corticospinal tract (CST) and discuss how DTI at different time points informed the treatment. OBSERVATIONS: A 9-year-old female presented with a sudden headache and left hemiparesis. She was found to have a Spetzler-Martin grade III, Supplementary grade I AVM in the right caudate and centrum semiovale, with obliteration and corresponding reduced fractional anisotropy (FA), fiber density (FD), and tract count (TC) of the adjacent CST on DTI. The patient remained stable and was scheduled for elective resection following a 6-week period to facilitate hematoma resorption. After 6 weeks, repeat DTI showed part of the nidus within intact CST fibers with concordant improvement in FA, FD, and TC. Considering the nidus location, CST integrity, and motor function recovery, surgery was deferred in favor of stereotactic radiosurgery. LESSONS: In ruptured AVMs, DTI may initially create an incomplete picture and false assumptions about white matter tract integrity. DTI should be repeated if delayed treatment is appropriate to ensure informed decision-making and prevent avoidable permanent neurological deficits. https://thejns.org/doi/10.3171/CASE24225.",2024 Aug 19,2024,Journal of neurosurgery.

They are one of the commonest causes of spontaneous intracranial haemorrhage in children and may be associated with significant morbidity and mortality in cases of rupture. Treatment strategies include microsurgical resection, endovascular embolisation, stereotactic radiosurgery, multimodality treatment with a combination thereof, and particularly in high-grade bAVMs, conservative management. Clinicians involved in treating bAVMs need to have familiarity with the natural history pertaining to bAVMs in terms of risk of rupture, risk factors elevating rupture risk as well as understanding the clinical manifestations of bAVMs. This invited review serves to provide a synthesis on natural history and clinical presentation of bAVMs with particular focus in children to inform decision-making pertaining to management.",2024 May,2024,Journal of Korean Neurosurgical Society,67,3,280-288,eng,False,10.3340/jkns.2024.0037;jkns.2024.0037;jkns-2024-0037;10.3340/jkns.2024.0037,Journal Article,,Arteriovenous malformations;Brain arteriovenous malformation;Haemorrhage;Natural history;Rupture
35233313,Remote Development of Symptomatic Intracranial Cavernous Malformation After Stereotactic Radiosurgery.,"Cavernous hemangiomas, or cavernomas, are vascular malformations that affect about 0.1-0.5% of the population and usually result from sporadic or familial mutations of genes involved with endothelial cell junctions. They are histologically described as dilated vascular clusters, and they may occur in various areas of the body. Cavernomas of the central nervous system can generate localizing symptoms, including focal neurological defects, headaches, seizures, and hemorrhage. Radiation-induced cavernomas (RICs) have been described in the literature since 1994 and have been more frequently described in children. Although there has been speculation about the pathophysiology of RICs, no consensus exists in the literature, and pathological evaluation of RICs remains sparsely reported. We present the case of a 63-year-old patient who underwent stereotactic radiosurgery for treatment of an intracranial arteriovenous malformation (AVM) and subsequently developed a symptomatic RIC seven years later that required microresection. Clinicians should exercise diligence when monitoring patients with a history of intracranial radiation because of growing evidence supporting cavernomas as potential late-stage sequelae.",2022 Jan,2022,Cureus,14,1,e21635,eng,False,10.7759/cureus.21635;e21635;10.7759/cureus.21635,Case Reports;Journal Article,,cavernoma;radiation-induced;stereotactic radiosurgery

20465910,Supratentorial Brain AVM Embolization with Onyx-18 and Post-Embolization Management. A Single-Center Experience.,"Onyx is increasingly used in endovascular therapy of intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). However, the embolic effect and post-embolization management are still under discussion. We report our experience in the treatment of supratentorial brain arteriovenous malformations (SBAVMs) with Onyx and discuss post-embolic management. From June 2006 to July 2008, 20 patients with SBAVM were embolized with Onyx. There were 14 men and six women ranging from 14 to 64 years of age (mean 38.3 years). Initial symptoms included spontaneous hemorrhage (n=12), headaches (n=4), seizure (n=3) and incidentally disclosed after head trauma (n=1). After the endovascular procedure, all had subsequent treatment (follow-up angiogram, stereotactic radiosurgery or microsurgery) according to the obliteration degree. At angiography, seven patients (35%, 7/20) were completely obliterated (over 95% closure) after embolization while one suffered a small subarachnoid hemorrhage without permanent clinical sequelae. Four patients (20%, 4/20) were subtotally obliterated (over 80% closure), one patient who suffered severe cerebral edema after embolization underwent decompressive craniectomy, two patients had additional radiosurgery and one patient had follow-up angiogram. Nine patients (45%, 9/20) were partially obliterated (20-80% closure), five patients had additional surgery, two patients had additional radiosurgery and two patients had follow-up angiogram (one patient had intraventricular hemorrhage three months after embolization). Of all 20 AVMs, an average of 2.2 ml Onyx was used per patient and average volume reduction was 80% (range, 30%-99%). Onyx is suitable for embolization of SBAVMs because of its diffuse controllable properties. We suggest clinical follow-up after complete obliteration, additional radiosurgery or angiographic follow-up after subtotal obliteration and additional surgery after partially obliteration. More cases with long-term follow-up are needed to evaluate the long-term prognosis of our post-embolization management.",2009 Sep,2009,"Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology,",15,3,275-82,eng,False,IN.v15.i3.p275;10.1177/159101990901500304,Journal Article,,
23450258,Hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for large or involving critical organs cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"BACKGROUND: The treatment of large arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) or AVMs involving eloquent regions of the brain remains a challenge. For inoperable lesions, observation, volume-staged radiosurgery or hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HFSRT) are proposed. The aim of our study was to assess the safety and efficiency of HFSRT for large AVMs located in eloquent areas of the brain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An analysis of records of 49 patients irradiated for cerebral AVMs with a mean dose of 19.9 Gy (12-28 Gy) delivered in 2-4 fractions with planned gap (at least one week) between fractions. Actuarial obliteration rates and annual bleeding hazard were calculated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and life tables. RESULTS: Annual bleeding hazard rates were 4.5% and 1.6% after one and two years of the follow-up, respectively. Actuarial total obliteration rates were 7%, 11%, and 21% and total response rate (total and partial obliterations) 22%, 41%, and 55% after one, two and three years of the follow-up, respectively. There was a trend towards larger total obliteration rate in patients irradiated with fraction dose ≥ 8 Gy and total dose > 21 Gy for lesions of volume ≤ 8.18 cm(3) which was not observed in case of partial obliterations. CONCLUSIONS: HFSRT results with relatively low obliteration rate but is not associated with a significant risk of permanent neurological deficits if both total and fraction doses are adjusted to size and location of the lesion. Predictive factors for total and partial obliterations can be different; this observation, however, is not firmly supported and requires further studies.",2013 Mar,2013,Radiology and oncology,47,1,50-6,eng,False,10.2478/v10019-012-0046-7;rado-47-01-50;10.2478/v10019-012-0046-7,Journal Article,,arteriovenous malformations;hemorrhage;hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy;obliteration;stereotactic radiosurgery

METHODS: Patients diagnosed with AVMs who completed single fraction frameless robotic radiosurgery at Medstar Georgetown University Hospital between July 20, 2006 - March 11, 2013 were included in the present study. All patients received pre-treatment planning with CT angiogram (CTA) and MRI, and were treated using the CyberKnife radiosurgery platform. Patients were followed for at least four years or until radiographic obliteration of the AVM was observed. RESULTS: Twenty patients were included in the present study. The majority of patients were diagnosed with Spetzler Martin Grade II (35%) or III (35%) AVMs. The AVM median nidus diameter and nidal volume was 1.8 cm and 4.38 cc, respectively. Median stereotactic radiosurgery dose was 1,800 cGy. After a median follow-up of 42 months, the majority of patients (81.3%) had complete obliteration of their AVM. All patients who were treated to a total dose of 1800 cGy demonstrated complete obliteration. One patient treated at a dose of 2,200 cGy developed temporary treatment-related toxicity, and one patient developed post-treatment hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: Frameless robotic radiosurgery with non-invasive CTA and MRI radiography appears to be a safe and effective radiation modality and serves as a novel alternative to traditional invasive catheter-angiography, frame-based methods for the treatment of intracranial AVMs. Adequate obliteration can be achieved utilizing 1,800 cGy in a single fraction, and minimizes treatment-related side effects.",2020,2020,Frontiers in oncology,10,,570782,eng,False,10.3389/fonc.2020.570782;570782;10.3389/fonc.2020.570782,Journal Article,,CyberKnife;arteriovenous malformations;neuroradiology;pilot study;radiosurgery
31555346,Brain arteriovenous malformation with transdural blood supply: Current status.,"Arterial blood supply to a brain arteriovenous malformation (BAVM) is mainly derived from the internal carotid artery (ICA) and vertebral basilar artery (VBA) system. However, in certain cases, arteries supplying the meninges may also contribute to the blood supply of the BAVM, resulting in the formation of a BAVM with transdural blood supply (TBS). To review the current status of BAVM with TBS, a literature search was performed in the PubMed database. Articles were screened for relevance and suitability of data. According to recent studies, the mechanisms by which TBS to a BAVM forms are mainly classified into the congenital and acquired type. BAVM with TBS is common in elderly patients and is characterized by intracranial hemorrhage, epilepsy, chronic headache and increased intracranial pressure. Digital subtraction angiography is the gold standard for diagnosing BAVM with TBS. Superselective angiography is also important. Treatments for BAVM with TBS include surgical resection, endovascular treatment (EVT), stereotactic radiosurgery and combined treatment. Surgical resection is difficult to perform. EVT has become the major therapy for treating BAVM with TBS due to its low procedural invasiveness. Combination of surgical resection and EVT may be a good option. In addition, stereotactic radiosurgery is frequently used as a complementary treatment to surgical and endovascular interventions.

20584432,Symptomatic Radionecrosis after AVM Stereotactic Radiosurgery. Study of 16 Consecutive Patients.,"The purpose of our study was to analyze the outcome of symptomatic radionecrosis following stereotactic radiosurgery for brain arteriovenous malformations. Of 225 patients treated by linear accelerator radiosurgery for brain AVM, 16 (7,1%) presented post-radiosurgery symptomatic radionecrosis on a mean follow-up period of 50 months (range 1-123 months). Once diagnosed with radionecrosis, 14 of 16 patients were subjected to high dose corticotherapy consisting of escalating doses of dexamethasone for several weeks. The mean interval of occurrence of new symptoms was 11.6 months post-radiosurgery (range 6-20 months). The mean time of follow-up was 2.9 years post radiotherapy ranging from seven months to eight years. Of the 16 patients with symptomatic radionecrosis, 11 (68,75%) showed complete resolution of symptoms while five (31,25%) showed improvement but still presented a neurological deficit at the closing date of the study. At the closing date, 11 patients (68.75%) had angiographically completely obliterated arteriovenous malformations while another two patients had an obliteration of 95% to 98% and one patient had a 98% obliteration with development of a new contralateral AVM. In our series, symptomatic radionecrosis occurred in 7.1% of patients treated with stereotactic radiosurgery for brain AVM. These patients where subjected to a prompt, high dose corticosteroid treatment and most presented symptom resolution or improvement with a fair obliteration rate, offering protection from bleeding. Permanent neurologic deficits attributable to radionecrosis occurred in 2.2% of our patient population treated with stereotactic radiosurgery for brain AVM.",2005 Mar 17,2005,"Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology,",11,1,25-33,eng,False,IN.v11.i1.p25;10.1177/159101990501100104,Journal Article,,
39524576,Delayed cyst formation after radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformation: A case report and critical review.,"BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a validated treatment option for cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), even if a greater knowledge of its potential delayed complications is still being acquired. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 49-year-old man suffered multiple episodes of cerebral hemorrhage in an approximate 10-year follow-up interval in the context of a left central core AVM with deep venous drainage into the internal cerebral veins (Spetzler Martin Grade 4) despite being treated with gamma knife radiosurgery at two separate timepoints, and with an almost complete obliteration confirmed. Approximately 10 years after the first radiosurgery treatment, he developed severe motor aphasia, Grade 3 right hemiparesis, progressive confusion, and memory deficits. Cerebral imaging revealed cystic degeneration in the AVM's periphery. Cyst fenestration and cystoperitoneal shunt were attempted. The treatments were temporarily effective, but a progressive cyst enlargement recurred with clinical deterioration. The patient was therefore proposed for surgical mass and cyst excision through an interhemispheric transcallosal approach. The postoperative magnetic resonance imaging showed complete removal of the lesion, and an uneventful post-operative course ensued. At the 6-month follow-up, our patient experienced a noticeable improvement in his speech, power, dexterity and was able to walk autonomously. CONCLUSION: Cystic degeneration of AVMs is a possible long-term complication after SRS. Long-term follow-up and data on such patients remain crucial, even with evidence of complete nidal obliteration.",2024,2024,Surgical neurology international,15,,371,eng,False,10.25259/SNI_391_2024;371;10.25259/SNI_391_2024;10.25259/SNI_391_2024,Case Reports;Journal Article,,Arteriovenous malformation (AVM);Chronic encapsulated expanding hematomas (CEEH);Delayed Cyst (DC);Radiosurgery (RS)
36433879,Long-term follow-up of an overexposure radiation incident in a cohort treated with linear accelerator-based stereotactic radiosurgery for intracranial arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVE: Dosimetric radiosurgery incidents are rare and probably insufficiently reported in scientific publications. After a long follow-up (FU), the authors studied the outcomes of patients treated with overexposure radiation for arteriovenous malformation (AVM) administered via stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) at their department. METHODS: Between May 2006 and June 2007, 22 patients were treated for AVM with SRS. The mean (range) patient age was 43.5 (11.8-78) years. Previous treatments were embolization (n = 10), SRS (1), and surgery (1). The average (range) volume was 2.1 (0.2-6.4) cm3. The median prescribed minimal dose was 18.0 Gy. An initial error in the estimation of scatter factors led to overexposure to radiation. Due to this incident, the median delivered minimum dose was 25.0 Gy. All patients were prospectively followed with clinical examination and imaging. RESULTS: The mean (range) clinical FU was 14.5 (12.0-15.2) years. AVM obliteration after SRS was completed in 90.9% of patients at a mean (range) of 39.4 (24.4-70.4) months. No patient had post-SRS AVM bleeding. Three patients (13.6%) had new permanent deficits due to radiation-induced changes (RICs). Obliteration without new deficits was achieved in 18 patients (81.8%). Two patients had new epilepsy that was probably due to RIC but well controlled. The median (range) MRI FU was 13.8 (2.5-14.9) years. During MRI FU, two RIC periods were observed: one classic period during the first 3 years showed T1-weighted annular irregular enhancement (13%), and the other period between 5 and 15 years after SRS showed the occurrence of cystic and hemorrhagic lesions (22.7%). There were no cases of radiation-induced tumor. CONCLUSIONS: The present long-term report showed that this overexposure incident probably increased the AVM obliteration rate. This overexposure seems to have induced RIC and in particular a higher rate of cystic and hemorrhagic late lesions with nevertheless moderate clinical consequences. Long-term FU for AVM is mandatory due to the risk of late RIC.",2023 Jun 1,2023,Journal of neurosurgery,138,6,1615-1621,eng,False,10.3171/2022.10.JNS221763;10.3171/2022.10.JNS221763,Journal Article,,AVM;arteriovenous malformation;dosimetric incident;radiation overexposure;radiation-induced changes;stereotactic radiosurgery
35673663,Acquired Chiari malformation Type I and holocord syringomyelia associated with a high-flow supratentorial fistulous arteriovenous malformations: A case report and literature review.,"BACKGROUND: Chiari malformation Type I (CMI) is generally considered a congenital lesion and typically associated with syringomyelia. Acquired CMI or adult Chiari malformation caused by intracranial mass is extremely rare. Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are characteristically symptomatic due to seizure, intracranial hemorrhage, or neurological deficit. We report an extremely rare case of an acquired CMI and extensive syringomyelia associated with a large supratentorial AVM. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 35-year-old woman was referred to our institute after a diagnosis of CMI and extensive syringomyelia from whole-spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) due to complaining of low back pain radiating to the right leg for the past 1 month. She had intermittent headache for 2 years. The patient underwent suboccipital decompression and C1 laminectomy followed by duraplasty. Two months later, she developed severe right-sided sciatic pain and complete right foot drop. Follow-up MRI revealed progressive enlargement of a syrinx cavity at the lower spinal cord and a large right parieto-occipital AVM with markedly dilated cortical draining veins and diffuse engorgement of dural venous sinuses was detected. This AVM supplied mainly by enlarged cortical branches of the right middle cerebral artery and posterior cerebral artery with multiple dural supplies. Endovascular treatment of a high-flow fistulous AVM was successfully performed with N-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA) through the hypertrophic branches of the right middle cerebral artery. Four months after embolization, the patient had recovered completely from the right foot drop. Further staged embolization was planned to reduce the size and flow of the AVM before stereotactic radiosurgery. However, the patient was lost to follow-up due to financial reason. One year later, she developed sudden severe headache followed by alteration of conscious due to intraventricular hemorrhage from the AVM, leading to obstructive hydrocephalus requiring cerebrospinal fluid diversion. During a period of 2 years, the patient underwent several staged embolization with NBCA and Onyx. Final cerebral angiography after embolization demonstrated a significant reduction in size and flow of the brain AVM. A control whole-spine MRI revealed a significant reduction in syrinx size. At the end of embolization, the patient had no neurological deficit. However, she had suffered from persistent central neuropathic pain at the right lower extremity. The AVM remnant was further treated by stereotactic radiosurgery. CONCLUSION: Increased cerebral venous hypertension secondary to a high-flow supratentorial AVM leading to posterior fossa venous hypertension may play a major role in the pathogenesis of CMI, induced the formation of syringomyelia. Endovascular treatment of brain AVM, the underlying cause of CMI, resulted in a significant reduction of the size of the syrinx. The need for cranial imaging in initial evaluation of cases with adult Chiari malformation is important.",2022,2022,Surgical neurology international,13,,217,eng,False,10.25259/SNI_11_2022;217;10.25259/SNI_11_2022;10.25259/SNI_11_2022,Case Reports;Journal Article,,Brain arteriovenous malformations;Chiari malformation type I;Foot drop;Holocord syringomyelia;Neuropathic pain
33307527,Stereotactic radiosurgery with versus without prior Onyx embolization for brain arteriovenous malformations.,"OBJECTIVE: Investigations of the combined effects of neoadjuvant Onyx embolization and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) on brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) have not accounted for initial angioarchitectural features prior to neuroendovascular intervention. The aim of this retrospective, multicenter matched cohort study is to compare the outcomes of SRS with versus without upfront Onyx embolization for AVMs using de novo characteristics of the preembolized nidus. METHODS: The International Radiosurgery Research Foundation AVM databases from 1987 to 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were categorized based on AVM treatment approach into Onyx embolization (OE) and SRS (OE+SRS) or SRS alone (SRS-only) cohorts and then propensity score matched in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome was AVM obliteration. Secondary outcomes were post-SRS hemorrhage, all-cause mortality, radiological and symptomatic radiation-induced changes (RICs), and cyst formation. Comparisons were analyzed using crude rates and cumulative probabilities adjusted for competing risk of death. RESULTS: The matched OE+SRS and SRS-only cohorts each comprised 53 patients. Crude rates (37.7% vs 47.2% for the OE+SRS vs SRS-only cohorts, respectively; OR 0.679, p = 0.327) and cumulative probabilities at 3, 4, 5, and 6 years (33.7%, 44.1%, 57.5%, and 65.7% for the OE+SRS cohort vs 34.8%, 45.5%, 59.0%, and 67.1% for the SRS-only cohort, respectively; subhazard ratio 0.961, p = 0.896) of AVM obliteration were similar between the matched cohorts. The secondary outcomes of the matched cohorts were also similar. Asymptomatic and symptomatic embolization-related complication rates in the matched OE+SRS cohort were 18.9% and 9.4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Pre-SRS AVM embolization with Onyx does not appear to negatively influence outcomes after SRS. These analyses, based on de novo nidal characteristics, thereby refute previous studies that found detrimental effects of Onyx embolization on SRS-induced AVM obliteration. However, given the risks incurred by nidal embolization using Onyx, this neoadjuvant intervention should be used judiciously in multimodal treatment strategies involving SRS for appropriately selected large-volume or angioarchitecturally high-risk AVMs.",2021 Sep 1,2021,Journal of neurosurgery,135,3,742-750,eng,True,10.3171/2020.7.JNS201731;10.3171/2020.7.JNS201731,Journal Article,,arteriovenous malformation;embolization;endovascular;stereotactic radiosurgery;stroke;vascular disorders
32590353,Early obliteration of pediatric brain arteriovenous malformations after stereotactic radiosurgery: an international multicenter study.,"OBJECTIVE: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a treatment option for pediatric brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), and early obliteration could encourage SRS utilization for a subset of particularly radiosensitive lesions. The objective of this study was to determine predictors of early obliteration after SRS for pediatric AVMs. METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective review of the International Radiosurgery Research Foundation AVM database. Obliterated pediatric AVMs were sorted into early (obliteration ≤ 24 months after SRS) and late (obliteration > 24 months after SRS) responders. Predictors of early obliteration were identified, and the outcomes of each group were compared. RESULTS: The overall study cohort was composed of 345 pediatric patients with obliterated AVMs. The early and late obliteration cohorts were made up of 95 (28%) and 250 (72%) patients, respectively. Independent predictors of early obliteration were female sex, a single SRS treatment, a higher margin dose, a higher isodose line, a deep AVM location, and a smaller AVM volume. The crude rate of post-SRS hemorrhage was 50% lower in the early (3.2%) than in the late (6.4%) obliteration cohorts, but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.248). The other outcomes of the early versus late obliteration cohorts were similar, with respect to symptomatic radiation-induced changes (RICs), cyst formation, and tumor formation. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one-quarter of pediatric AVMs that become obliterated after SRS will achieve this radiological endpoint within 24 months of initial SRS. The authors identified multiple factors associated with early obliteration, which may aid in prognostication and management. The overall risks of delayed hemorrhage, RICs, cyst formation, and tumor formation were not statistically different in patients with early versus late obliteration.",2020 Oct 1,2020,Journal of neurosurgery.

32370235,Gamma Knife Radiosurgery Followed by Flow-Reductive Embolization for Ruptured Arteriovenous Malformation.,": Background: Aggressive treatment to achieve complete obliteration of brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is necessary in patients with a recent history of hemorrhage. The major drawback of Gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) alone for AVM is risk of bleeding during the latent period until the AVM occludes. At our center, patients who present with ruptured AVMs are frequently offered GKRS followed by embolization. The goal of this study was to compare outcomes of embolization for patients who have previously undergone GKRS for ruptured AVMs. METHODS: A database including 150 GKRS for ruptured AVMs between November 2008 and October 2017 was reviewed. The embolized group was selected by including AVMs with post-GKRS embolization. The non-embolized group was defined as AVMs treated by GKRS alone. Outcomes including obliteration rate, incidence of repeat hemorrhage, and delayed cyst formation were compared between two groups. The predictive factors related to AVM obliteration and complications were analyzed. RESULTS: The study consisted of 81 patients in the non-embolized group and 17 patients in the embolized group. Statistically significant differences were detected between the two groups with respect to age, Pollock-Flickinger score, Spetzler-Martin (SM) grade, eloquence of adjacent brain, and presence of aneurysms. The embolized group included more AVMs with larger median nidus volume. The predictive factors for the obliteration of ruptured AVMs were nidus volume, SM grade, Virginia Radiosurgery AVM Scale (VRAS), and Pollock-Flickinger score and for the subsequent hemorrhage were marginal dose, nidus volume, SM grade, VRAS, and Pollock-Flickinger score. The obliteration rates and complication rates after GKRS between groups were not significantly different. However, this study demonstrated statistically significant difference in the cumulative incidence of obliteration in AVMs with SM grade III and IV (p = 0.037). CONCLUSION: Although the current study demonstrated similar results in patients who underwent GKRS with and without embolization, the embolized group included more AVMs with larger nidus volume, higher SM grade, Pollock-Flickinger score, and aneurysm, which have a lower chance of obliteration and a higher probability of repeat hemorrhage. GKRS followed by embolization appears to be a beneficial approach for the treatment of ruptured AVMs that are at risk for obliteration failure and repeat hemorrhage during the latency period after single-session GKRS alone. Further studies involving a larger number of cases and continuous follow-up are necessary to confirm our conclusions.",2020 May 2,2020,Journal of clinical medicine,9,5,,eng,True,10.3390/jcm9051318;1318;jcm9051318;jcm-09-01318;10.3390/jcm9051318,Journal Article,,Spetzler-Martin grade;arteriovenous malformation (AVM);cerebrovascular disease (CVD);embolization;gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS);intracerebral hemorrhage;radiosurgery
32190515,"Assessment of Different Modalities and Their Impact on Patients with Ruptured Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformation Treated in King Abdulaiziz Medical City in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.","Background Intracranial arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a rare congenital disease that is characterized by an abnormal tangle of blood vessels where arteries abnormally shunt into veins with no intervening capillary bed. Several treatment modalities, such as microsurgical removal, embolization, and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), are used to treat AVM either solely or in combination. We aimed to assess and compare the effect, morbidity, and mortality outcomes of mono-treatment with embolization and combined treatment for AVM obliteration. Methodology This retrospective cohort study was conducted in the National Guard Hospital Jeddah and reviewed all the AVM patients that visited the center between 2008 and 2017. We assessed presenting symptoms at diagnosis and any co-morbidities as the clinical characteristics and the patients' AVM and Spetzler-Martin grade as the morphological characteristics. Moreover, we performed a three-year follow-up on suitable patients and assessed their outcomes using the modified Rankin Scale. In addition, we performed follow-up imaging on the patients to evaluate AVM obliteration after any of the procedures. Results We included 29 patients treated in our hospital (72.4%, males; 27.6%, females; mean age 40 years). About 65% of the patients underwent mono-therapy consisting of one or more embolization sessions while about 34% underwent combined treatment (embolization + surgery or embolization + SRS). We found more cases of complete obliteration among patients who underwent mono-therapy (52.6%) than among those who underwent combined treatment (30%). Patients who underwent mono-therapy showed better outcomes compared to those who underwent combined therapy; however, the difference did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions Embolization mono-therapy appears to be more effective with regards to the obliteration rate and outcome compared to combined therapy with either SRS or surgery in patients treated in our center.",2020 Feb 12,2020,Cureus,12,2,e6969,eng,False,10.7759/cureus.6969;e6969;10.7759/cureus.6969,Journal Article,,avm;embolization;intracranial arteriovenous malformations;radiosurgery;vascular malformation
25984390,Diagnosis and evaluation of intracranial arteriovenous malformations.,"BACKGROUND: Ideal management of intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) remains poorly defined. Decisions regarding management of AVMs are based on the expected natural history of the lesion and risk prediction for peritreatment morbidity. Microsurgical resection, stereotactic radiosurgery, and endovascular embolization alone or in combination are all viable treatment options, each with different risks. The authors attempt to clarify the existing literature's understanding of the natural history of intracranial AVMs, and risk-assessment grading scales for each of the three treatment modalities. METHODS: The authors conducted a literature review of the existing AVM natural history studies and studies that clarify the utility of existing grading scales available for the assessment of peritreatment risk for all three treatment modalities. RESULTS: The authors systematically outline the diagnosis and evaluation of patients with intracranial AVMs and clarify estimation of the expected natural history and predicted risk of treatment for intracranial AVMs. CONCLUSION: AVMs are a heterogenous pathology with three different options for treatment.

19096630,Retrospective analysis on 76 cases of cerebral arteriovenous malformations treated by gamma knife radiosurgery.,"OBJECTIVE: Outcome of gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS) in the consecutive 100 cases with cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) was analyzed. METHODS: Data from initial 100 patients treated with GKS in the authors' institute were reviewed retrospectively. Spetzler-Martin grade at diagnosis were I in 18 patients, II in 27, III in 36, IV in 11, and V in 8. Thirty-five patients had experienced previous bleeding, 27 patients presented with seizure, and 31 patients presented with headache. The mean volume of the lesion was 4.3 cm(3) (0.1-29.3 cm(3)). The median radiation dose delivered to the margin was 20.0 Gy (13-32 Gy). Mean follow-up period was 37.5 months (5-63 months). RESULTS: Angiographic follow-up was performed in 48 patients at least 2 years after GKS. Sixteen patients were lost in follow up following 2 years from GKS. Twenty-eight of 48 patients (58%) showed complete obliteration and 20 patients (42%) showed partial obliteration. Seven patients presented with post-GKS hemorrhage. Adverse radiation effect (ARE) was observed at follow-up MRI in 25 of 76 patients, and it was symptomatic in 5 patients. Complete obliteration was confirmed in 24 of 31 (77%) patients with volume less than 4 cm(3), meanwhile only 4 of 17 (24%) patients with volume of 4 cm(3) or more showed complete obliteration. Complete obliteration rate was 67% with 20 Gy or higher marginal dose, 63% with 15-20 Gy, and 17% with less than 15 Gy. CONCLUSION: GKS can provide high rates of obliteration with acceptable risk of morbidity in a subgroup of small AVMs. However, overall outcome in whole spectrum of AVMs, in which large proportion of cases have unfavorable characteristics for radiosurgery, is much worse.

29541280,Case Report of an Obstructive Hydrocephalus Caused by an Unruptured Mesencephalic Arteriovenous Malformation in a Boy and a Review of Literature.,"OBJECTIVE: Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is the most common form of intracranial vascular malformations in adults. Intracranial pediatric AVMs are rare. AVM located in the vicinity of the brain stem in children are even more rare. CASE REPORT: This study reports a rare case of acute obstructive hydrocephalus following aqueductal stenosis caused by an unruptured grade IV perimesencephalic arteriovenous malformation. An 11-year-old boy admitted to the hospital with progressive headache, nausea and vomiting throughout a month. A Computerized Tomography (CT) showed an obstructive hydrocephaly. A Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging revealed a mesencephalic AVM compressing the aqueduct. The patient deteriorated in hours and an emergency ventriculoperitoneal shunting was performed. He did well in the early postoperative period. AVM examined with Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) in detail for maintaining the definitive treatment by means of endovascular embolization, microsurgery and stereotactic radiosurgery; but the patient was lost to follow up. CONCLUSION: A Pubmed search revealed 34 cases of hydrocephalus caused by an unruptured AVM in the literature, and only four cases were less than 18 years old with unruptured AVM locating in brain stem or posterior fossa. Although focal neurologic deficit, seizure and headache are the most common symptoms, acute neurologic deterioration due to hydrocephalus may be the presenting symptom in these cases. The decrease in intracranial pressure by changing the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via an emergency ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunting or Endoscopic Third Ventriculostomy (ETV) can be a lifesaving procedure that gives a chance for further treatment modalities.",2018,2018,The open neuroimaging journal,12,,10-15,eng,False,10.2174/1874440001812010010;TONIJ-12-10;10.2174/1874440001812010010,Case Reports;Journal Article,,Aqueduct;Arteriovenous malformation;Digital subtraction angiography;Hydrocephalus;Mesencephalon;Ventriculoperitoneal shunt
19763213,Multi-modality treatment for intracranial arteriovenous malformation associated with arterial aneurysm.,"OBJECTIVE: Intracranial arteriovenous malformation (AVM) associated with aneurysm has been infrequently encountered and the treatment for this malady is challenging. We report here on our clinical experience with AVMs associated with arterial aneurysms that were managed by multimodality treatments, including clipping of the aneurysm, microsurgery, Gamma-knife radiosurgery (GKS) and Guglielmi detachable coil (GDC) embolization. METHODS: We reviewed the treatment plans, radiological findings and clinical courses of 21 patients who were treated with GKS for AVM associated with aneurysm. RESULTS: Twenty-seven aneurysms in 21 patients with AVMs were enrolled in this study. Hemorrhage was the most frequent presenting symptom (17 patients : 80.9%). Bleeding was caused by an AVM nidus in 11 cases, aneurysm rupture in 5 and an undetermined origin in 1. Five patients were treated for associated aneurysm with clipping followed by GKS for the AVM and 11 patients were treated with GDC embolization combined with GKS for an AVM. Although 11 associated aneurysms remained untreated after GKS, none of them ruptured and 4 aneurysms regressed during the follow up period. Two aneurysms increased in size despite the disappearance of the AVM nidus after GKS and then these aneurysms were treated with GDC embolization. CONCLUSION: If combined treatment using microsurgery, GKS and endovascular treatment can be adequately used for these patients, a better prognosis can be obtained. In particular, GKS and GDC embolization are considered to have significant roles to minimize neurologic injury.",2009 Aug,2009,Journal of Korean Neurosurgical Society,46,2,116-22,eng,False,10.3340/jkns.2009.46.2.116;10.3340/jkns.2009.46.2.116,Journal Article,,Aneurysm;Arteriovenous malformation;Endovascular treatment;GDC embolization;Radiosurgery
39654683,Cerebral vascular malformations: pathogenesis and therapy.,"Cerebral vascular malformations (CVMs), particularly cerebral cavernous malformations and cerebral arteriovenous malformations, pose significant neurological challenges due to their complex etiologies and clinical implications. Traditionally viewed as congenital conditions with structural abnormalities, CVMs have been treated primarily through resection, embolization, and stereotactic radiosurgery. While these approaches offer some efficacy, they often pose risks to neurological integrity due to their invasive nature. Advances in next-generation sequencing, particularly high-depth whole-exome sequencing and bioinformatics, have facilitated the identification of gene variants from neurosurgically resected CVMs samples. These advancements have deepened our understanding of CVM pathogenesis. Somatic mutations in key mechanistic pathways have been identified as causative factors, leading to a paradigm shift in CVM treatment. Additionally, recent progress in noninvasive and minimally invasive techniques, including gene imaging genomics, liquid biopsy, or endovascular biopsies (endovascular sampling of blood vessel lumens), has enabled the identification of gene variants associated with CVMs. These methods, in conjunction with clinical data, offer potential for early detection, dynamic monitoring, and targeted therapies that could be used as monotherapy or adjuncts to surgery.

Statistical analysis was performed using Python 3.10. RESULTS: In our cohort of patients, the median age was 45 years, with a slight male predominance (67 males, 61 females). At admission, 51.5% presented with elevated blood pressure. The majority of patients had a Spetzler-Martin score of 2 (37.5%), followed by scores of 3 (31.3%) and 1 (20.3%). Treatment strategies included microsurgical resection in 32% of cases, conservative management in 31.2%, Gamma Knife radiosurgery in 22.6%, and endovascular embolization in 13.3%. Notably, open surgery was predominantly chosen for Grade II AVMs. The functional outcomes were favorable, with 69.5% achieving a good recovery score on the Glasgow Outcome Scale. Only four in-hospital deaths occurred, all in patients who underwent open surgery, and no deaths were recorded during the two-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: AVMs within the same Spetzler-Martin grade display considerable complexity, necessitating personalized treatment strategies. Our findings highlight the limitations of open surgery for Grade I cases but affirm its effectiveness for Grade II AVMs.",2024 Nov 12,2024,Brain sciences,14,11,,eng,False,10.3390/brainsci14111136;1136;brainsci14111136;brainsci-14-01136;10.3390/brainsci14111136,Journal Article,,Spetzler–Martin grading system;arteriovenous malformation;endovascular embolization;radiosurgery;surgery
38784357,Prediction of Obliteration After the Gamma Knife Radiosurgery of Arteriovenous Malformations Using Hand-Crafted Radiomics and Deep-Learning Methods.,"INTRODUCTION: Brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) are vascular abnormalities that can be treated with embolization or radiotherapy to prevent the risk of future rupture. In this study, we use hand-crafted radiomics and deep learning techniques to predict favorable vs. unfavorable outcomes following Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) of bAVMs and compare their prediction performances. METHODS: One hundred twenty-six patients seen at one academic medical center for GKRS obliteration of bAVMs over 15 years were retrospectively reviewed. Forty-two patients met the inclusion criteria. Favorable outcomes were defined as complete nidus obliteration demonstrated on cerebral angiogram and asymptomatic recovery. Unfavorable outcomes were defined as incomplete obliteration or complications relating to the AVM that developed after GKRS. Outcome predictions were made using a random forest model with hand-crafted radiomic features and a fine-tuned ResNet-34 convolutional neural network (CNN) model. The performance was evaluated by using a ten-fold cross-validation technique. RESULTS: The average accuracy and area-under-curve (AUC) values of the Random Forest Classifier (RFC) with radiomics features were 68.5 ±9.80% and 0.705 ±0.086, whereas those of the ResNet-34 model were 60.0 ±11.9% and 0.694 ±0.124. Four radiomics features used with RFC discriminated unfavorable response cases from favorable response cases with statistical significance. When cropped images were used with ResNet-34, the accuracy and AUC decreased to 59.3 ± 14.2% and 55.4 ±10.4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A hand-crafted radiomics model and a pre-trained CNN model can be fine-tuned on pre-treatment MRI scans to predict clinical outcomes of AVM patients undergoing GKRS with equivalent prediction performance. The outcome predictions are promising but require further external validation on more patients.",2024 Apr,2024,Cureus,16,4,e58835,eng,False,10.7759/cureus.58835;e58835;10.7759/cureus.58835,Journal Article,,avm;convolutional neural network;gamma knife;predictive models;radiomics;radiosurgery
33679374,Long-Term Outcomes of Elderly Brain Arteriovenous Malformations After Different Management Modalities: A Multicenter Retrospective Study.,"Background: More and more elderly patients are being diagnosed with arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in this global aging society, while the treatment strategy remains controversial among these aging population. This study aimed to clarify the long-term outcomes of elderly AVMs after different management modalities. Methods: The authors retrospectively reviewed 71 elderly AVMs (>60 years) in two tertiary neurosurgery centers between 2011 and 2019. Patients were divided into four groups: conservation, microsurgery, embolization, and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). The perioperative complications, short-term and long-term neurological outcomes, obliteration rates, annualized rupture risk, and mortality rates were compared among different management modalities in the ruptured and unruptured subgroups. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was employed to compare the death-free survival rates among different management modalities. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for predictors of long-term unfavorable outcomes (mRS > 2). Results: A total of 71 elderly AVMs were followed up for an average of 4.2 ± 2.3 years. Fifty-four (76.1%) presented with hemorrhage, and the preoperative annualized rupture risk was 9.4%. Among these patients, 21 cases (29.6%) received conservative treatment, 30 (42.3%) underwent microsurgical resection, 13 (18.3%) received embolization, and 7 (9.9%) underwent SRS. In the prognostic comparison, the short-term and long-term neurological outcomes were similar between conservation and intervention both in the ruptured and unruptured subgroups (ruptured: p = 0.096, p = 0.904, respectively; unruptured: p = 0.568, p = 0.306, respectively). In the ruptured subgroup, the intervention cannot reduce long-term mortality (p = 0.654) despite the significant reduction of subsequent hemorrhage than conservation (p = 0.014), and the main cause of death in the intervention group was treatment-related complications (five of seven, 71.4%). In the logistic regression analysis, higher admission mRS score (OR 3.070, 95% CI 1.559-6.043, p = 0.001) was the independent predictor of long-term unfavorable outcomes (mRS>2) in the intervention group, while complete obliteration (OR 0.146, 95% CI 0.026-0.828, p = 0.030) was the protective factor. Conclusions: The long-term outcomes of elderly AVMs after different management modalities were similar. Intervention for unruptured elderly AVMs was not recommended. For those ruptured, we should carefully weigh the risk of subsequent hemorrhage and treatment-related complications. Besides, complete obliteration should be pursued once the intervention was initiated. Clinical Trial Registration: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

32398113,Propranolol for familial cerebral cavernous malformation (Treat_CCM): study protocol for a randomized controlled pilot trial.,"BACKGROUND: Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are vascular malformations characterized by clusters of enlarged leaky capillaries in the central nervous system. They may result in intracranial haemorrhage, epileptic seizure(s), or focal neurological deficits, and potentially lead to severe disability. Globally, CCMs represent the second most common intracranial vascular malformation in humans, and their familial form (FCCMs) accounts for one-fifth of cases. Neurosurgical excision, and perhaps stereotactic radiosurgery, is the only available therapeutic option. Case reports suggest that propranolol might modify disease progression. METHODS: Treat_CCM is a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint (PROBE), parallel-group trial involving six Italian clinical centres with central reading of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and adverse events. Patients with symptomatic FCCMs are randomized (2:1 ratio) either to propranolol (40-80 mg twice daily) in addition to standard care or to standard care alone (i.e. anti-epileptic drugs or headache treatments). The primary outcome is intracranial haemorrhage or focal neurological deficit attributable to CCMs. The secondary outcomes are MRI changes over time (i.e. de novo CCM lesions, CCM size and signal characteristics, iron deposition, and vascular leakage as assessed by quantitative susceptibility mapping and dynamic contrast enhanced permeability), disability, health-related quality of life, depression severity, and anxiety (SF-36, BDI-II, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory). DISCUSSION: Treat_CCM will evaluate the safety and efficacy of propranolol for CCMs following promising case reports in a randomized controlled trial. The direction of effect on the primary outcome and the consistency of effects on the secondary outcomes (even if none of them yield statistically significant differences) of this external pilot study may lead to a larger sample size in a definitive phase 2 trial.

32208214,Targeting of externalized αB-crystallin on irradiated endothelial cells with pro-thrombotic vascular targeting agents: Potential applications for brain arteriovenous malformations.,"BACKGROUND: Vascular targeting uses molecular markers on the surface of diseased vasculature for ligand-directed drug delivery to induce vessel occlusion or destruction. In the absence of discriminatory markers, such as in brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), stereotactic radiosurgery may be used to prime molecular changes on the endothelial surface. This study explored αB-crystallin (CRYAB) as a radiation induced target and pre-tested the specificity and efficacy of a CRYAB-targeting coaguligand for in vitro thrombus induction. METHODS: A parallel-plate flow system was established to circulate human whole blood over a layer of human brain endothelial cells. A conjugate of anti-CRYAB antibody and thrombin was injected into the circuit to compare binding and thrombus formation on cells with or without prior radiation treatment (0-25 Gy). RESULTS: Radiation increased CRYAB expression and surface exposure in human brain endothelial cells. In the parallel-plate flow system, the targeted anti-CRYAB-thrombin conjugate increased thrombus formation on the surface of irradiated cells relative to non-irradiated cells and to a non-targeting IgG-thrombin conjugate. Fibrin deposition and accumulation of fibrinogen degradation products increased significantly at radiation doses at or above 15 Gy with conjugate concentrations of 1.25 and 2.5 μg/mL. CONCLUSIONS: CRYAB exposure can be detected at the surface of human brain endothelial cells in response to irradiation. Pro-thrombotic CRYAB-targeting conjugates can bind under high flow conditions and in the presence of whole blood induce stable thrombus formation with high specificity and efficacy on irradiated surfaces.

31949520,Short Term Effectiveness of Gamma Knife Radiosurgery in the Management of Brain Arteriovenous Malformation.,"AIM: To evaluate the short-term effectiveness of Gamma knife radiosurgery as a modality of treatment of brain arteriovenous malformation. METHODS: Sixty-three patients with arteriovenous brain malformations underwent Gamma knife radiosurgery included in this prospective study between April 2017 and September 2018 with clinical and radiological with MRI follow up was done at three months and six months post-Gamma knife radiosurgery. By the end of the 12th-month post-Gamma knife radiosurgery, the patients were re-evaluated using digital subtraction angiography co-registered with M.R.I. During the 12 months follow up, CT scan or MRI was done at any time if any one of the patients' condition deteriorated or developed signs and symptoms of complications. The mean volume of the arteriovenous malformations treated was 26.0 ± 5 cm(3) (range 12.5-39.5 cm(3)) in The Neurosciences Hospital, Baghdad/Iraq. RESULTS: By the end of the 12th month of follow up, the overall obliteration of the arteriovenous malformations was seen in six patients only (9.5%), while shrinkage was noticed in 57 patients (90.5%). Improvement or clinical stability was found in 24 out of 39 patients (61.5%) presented with epilepsy as a chief complaint before Gamma knife radiosurgery and 21 out of 24 patients (87.0%) complained of a headache before Gamma knife radiosurgery. Post-Gamma knife radiosurgery bleeding was found in only three patients (5.0%). CONCLUSION: Even with the short term follow up, Gamma knife radiosurgery has an excellent clinical outcome in most patients with arteriovenous brain malformations. The clinical symptoms like headache and seizure were either diminished or controlled with the same medical treatment dose before Gamma knife radiosurgery.

32276243,Bringing high-grade arteriovenous malformations under control: clinical outcomes following multimodality treatment in children.,"OBJECTIVE: Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) consist of dysplastic blood vessels with direct arteriovenous shunts that can hemorrhage spontaneously. In children, a higher lifetime hemorrhage risk must be balanced with treatment-related morbidity. The authors describe a collaborative, multimodal strategy resulting in effective and safe treatment of pediatric AVMs. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database was performed in children with treated and nontreated pediatric AVMs at the University of California, San Francisco, from 1998 to 2017. Inclusion criteria were age ≤ 18 years at time of diagnosis and an AVM confirmed by a catheter angiogram. RESULTS: The authors evaluated 189 pediatric patients with AVMs over the study period, including 119 ruptured (63%) and 70 unruptured (37%) AVMs. The mean age at diagnosis was 11.6 ± 4.3 years. With respect to Spetzler-Martin (SM) grade, there were 38 (20.1%) grade I, 40 (21.2%) grade II, 62 (32.8%) grade III, 40 (21.2%) grade IV, and 9 (4.8%) grade V lesions. Six patients were managed conservatively, and 183 patients underwent treatment, including 120 resections, 82 stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), and 37 endovascular embolizations. Forty-four of 49 (89.8%) high-grade AVMs (SM grade IV or V) were treated. Multiple treatment modalities were used in 29.5% of low-grade and 27.3% of high-grade AVMs. Complete angiographic obliteration was obtained in 73.4% of low-grade lesions (SM grade I-III) and in 45.2% of high-grade lesions. A periprocedural stroke occurred in a single patient (0.5%), and there was 1 treatment-related death. The mean clinical follow-up for the cohort was 4.1 ± 4.6 years, and 96.6% and 84.3% of patients neurologically improved or remained unchanged in the ruptured and unruptured AVM groups following treatment, respectively. There were 16 bleeding events following initiation of AVM treatment (annual rate: 0.02 events per person-year). CONCLUSIONS: Coordinated multidisciplinary evaluation and individualized planning can result in safe and effective treatment of children with AVMs. In particular, it is possible to treat the majority of high-grade AVMs with an acceptable safety profile. Judicious use of multimodality therapy should be limited to appropriately selected patients after thorough team-based discussions to avoid additive morbidity. Future multicenter studies are required to better design predictive models to aid with patient selection for multimodal pediatric care, especially with high-grade AVMs.",2020 Jul 1,2020,Journal of neurosurgery.

38813441,Addressing barriers and identifying facilitators to support informed consent and recruitment in the Cavernous malformations A Randomised Effectiveness (CARE) pilot phase trial: insights from the integrated QuinteT recruitment intervention (QRI).,"BACKGROUND: It was anticipated that recruitment to the Cavernous malformations: A Randomised Effectiveness (CARE) pilot randomised trial would be challenging. The trial compared medical management and surgery (neurosurgical resection or stereotactic radiosurgery) with medical management alone, for people with symptomatic cerebral cavernous malformation (ISRCTN41647111). Previous trials comparing surgical and medical management for intracranial vascular malformations failed to recruit to target. A QuinteT Recruitment Intervention was integrated during trial accrual, September 2021-April 2023 inclusive, to improve informed consent and recruitment. METHODS: The QuinteT Recruitment Intervention combined iterative collection and analysis of quantitative data (28 trial site screening logs recording numbers/proportions screened, eligible, approached and randomised) and qualitative data (79 audio-recorded recruitment discussions, 19 interviews with healthcare professionals, 11 interviews with patients, 2 investigator workshops, and observations of study meetings, all subject to thematic, content or conversation analysis). We triangulated quantitative and qualitative data to identify barriers and facilitators to recruitment and how and why these arose. Working with the chief investigators and trial management group, we addressed barriers and facilitators with corresponding actions to improve informed consent and recruitment. FINDINGS: Barriers identified included how usual care practices made equipoise challenging, multi-disciplinary teams sometimes overrode recruiter equipoise and logistical issues rendered symptomatic cavernoma diagnosis and assessment for stereotactic radiosurgery challenging. Facilitators identified included the preparedness of some neurosurgeons' to offer surgery to people otherwise offered medical management alone, multi-disciplinary team equipoise, and effective information provision presenting participation as a solution to equipoise regarding management. Actions, before and during recruitment, to improve inclusivity of site screening, approach and effectiveness of information provision resulted in 72 participants recruited following a 5-month extension, exceeding the target of 60 participants. INTERPRETATION: QuinteT Recruitment Intervention insights revealed barriers and facilitators, enabling identification of remedial actions. Recruitment to a definitive trial would benefit from further training/support to encourage clinicians to be comfortable approaching patients to whom medical management is usually offered, and broadening the pool of neurosurgeons and multi-disciplinary team members prepared to offer surgery, particularly stereotactic radiosurgery.

37901933,Feasibility of Gamma Knife Radiosurgery for Brain Arteriovenous Malformations According to Nidus Type.,"OBJECTIVE: Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) is an effective and noninvasive treatment for high-risk arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Since differences in GKRS outcomes by nidus type are unknown, this study evaluated GKRS feasibility and safety in patients with brain AVMs. METHODS: This single-center retrospective study included patients with AVM who underwent GKRS between 2008 and 2021. Patients were divided into compact- and diffuse-type groups according to nidus characteristics. We excluded patients who performed GKRS and did not follow-up evaluation with magnetic resonance imaging or digital subtraction angiography within 36 months from the study. We used univariate and multivariate analyses to characterize associations of nidus type with obliteration rate and GKRS-related complications. RESULTS: We enrolled 154 patients (mean age, 32.14±17.17 years; mean post-GKRS follow-up, 52.10±33.67 months) of whom 131 (85.1%) had compact- and 23 (14.9%) diffuse-type nidus AVMs. Of all AVMs, 89 (57.8%) were unruptured, and 65 (42.2%) had ruptured. The mean Spetzler-Martin AVM grades were 2.03±0.95 and 3.39±1.23 for the compact- and diffuse-type groups, respectively (p<0.001). During the follow-up period, AVM-related hemorrhages occurred in four individuals (2.6%), three of whom had compact nidi. Substantial radiation-induced changes and cyst formation were observed in 21 (13.6%) and one patient (0.6%), respectively. The AVM complete obliteration rate was 46.1% across both groups. Post-GKRS complication and complete obliteration rates were not significantly different between nidus types. For diffuse-type nidus AVMs, larger AVM size and volume (p<0.001), lower radiation dose (p<0.001), eloquent area location (p=0.015), and higher Spetzler-Martin grade (p<0.001) were observed.

The AVM vascular structure was 3D reconstructed from brain computed tomography (CT) data acquired from a patient. For the phantom fabrication, stereolithography was used to produce the AVM model and combined with silicone casting to mimic the brain parenchyma surrounding the vascular structure. This model was made with tissues-equivalent materials for radiology. The hollow vascular system of the phantom was filled with a contrast agent usually employed on patients for CT scans. The radiological response of the phantom was tested and compared with the one of the clinical case. The constructed model demonstrated to be a very accurate physical representation of the AVM and its vasculature and good morphological consistency was observed between the model and the patient-specific source anatomy. These results suggest that the proposed method has potential to be used to fabricate patient-specific phantoms for neurovascular radiosurgery applications and medical research.",2021 Aug 1,2021,3D printing and additive manufacturing,8,4,217-226,eng,False,10.1089/3dp.2020.0305;10.1089/3dp.2020.0305;10.1089/3dp.2020.0305,Journal Article,,additive manufacturing;anthropomorphic phantoms;stereolithography;surgical applications;tissue-equivalent materials

21421288,Transarterial embolization of cerebral arteriovenous malformations: a durable treatment for venous side hemorrhage?,"Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) have been occasionally reported to bleed from their venous side. This may particularly be the case when venous ectasias or aneurysms develop in the setting of steno-occlusive venopathy. Venous side hemorrhage should be suspected when the hematoma is centered on the venous pouch or when a venous pseudoaneurysm is identified on angiography. For AVMs with an identifiable point of rupture, early treatment is recommended in an attempt to secure the weak spot and minimize the risk of rerupture. When possible, microsurgical resection is the definitive and preferred treatment. In contrast, because of its latency period, stereotactic radiosurgery does not confer immediate protection in such cases. Endovascular transarterial embolization may offer immediate cure to only a minority of small AVMs, but remains a very useful temporizing strategy for arterial rupture sites such as proximal or intranidal aneurysms, allowing to defer definitive AVM treatment by either microsurgery or radiosurgery to a later stage. However, when the rupture site is venous in location and the AVM cannot be readily cured by either microsurgery because of its location in eloquent brain or embolization because of its large size, protecting patients from early rerupture may become problematic. We propose that, by reducing flow through the AVM, transarterial embolization may lead to secondary thrombosis of venous pseudoaneurysms and confer durable occlusion of these weak spots, pending definitive AVM cure. Therefore, transarterial embolization should be routinely attempted in such difficult-to-manage cases. An illustrative clinical case is presented in support of this hypothesis.",2011 Jun,2011,Medical hypotheses,76,6,827-30,eng,False,10.1016/j.mehy.2011.02.029;S0306-9877(11)00080-6;10.1016/j.mehy.2011.02.029,Case Reports;Journal Article,"Aged;*Arteries;Arteriovenous Malformations/pathology/*therapy;Brain/*blood supply;*Embolization, Therapeutic;Humans;Intracranial Hemorrhages/pathology/*therapy;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;*Veins",
26933340,Impact on cognitive functions following gamma knife radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"BACKGROUND: Radiosurgery is an alternative to surgical resection of arteriovenous malformation (AVM). Very few studies have addressed the concern of radiation injury to the brain and its attendant adverse effects on cognitive function. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study included all patients who underwent gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) at our institute for cerebral AVM between 2006 and December 2008 (n = 34). All patients underwent neuropsychological evaluation before the procedure. Neuropsychological evaluation was repeated in eighteen patients 2 years following GKRS. Clinical outcome, AVM obliteration, and factors influencing outcome were analyzed in these eighteen patients. RESULTS: Before GKRS, more than 50% had significant impairment of neuropsychological functions compared to normal population norms. 66.6% achieved the excellent radiosurgical outcome. At 2 years follow-up, patients showed varied improvement in neuropsychological function in various categories. Pretherapeutic median value for percentage perseverative responses was 26.5 and at follow-up, it reduced to 18.2 (P = 0.039). Set shifting improved in 11 patients (61.1%), remained same in 5 patients (27.7%), and deteriorated in two patients (11.1%). Patients with a higher Spetzler-Martin grade AVM demonstrated a significantly more favorable shift in follow-up test values for set shifting function (P = 0.021). Patients with postradiation imaging changes had lesser tendency to improve in neuropsychological performance at follow-up.

18813170,Cerebral arteriovenous malformations: comparison of novel magnetic resonance angiographic techniques and conventional catheter angiography.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential of novel magnetic resonance (MR) angiographic techniques for the assessment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations. METHODS: Forty patients who were about to undergo stereotactic radiosurgery were prospectively recruited. Three-dimensional, sliding-slab interleaved ky (SLINKY), time-of-flight acquisition was performed, as was a dynamic MR digital subtraction angiography (DSA) procedure in which single thick slices (6-10 cm) were obtained using a radiofrequency spoiled Fourier-acquired steady-state sequence (1 image/s). Sixty images were acquired, in two or three projections, during passage of a 6- to 10-ml bolus of gadolinium chelate. Subtraction and postprocessing were performed, and images were viewed in an inverted cine mode. SLINKY time-of-flight acquisition was repeated after the administration of gadolinium. Routine stereotactic conventional catheter angiography was performed after MR imaging. All images were assessed (in a blinded randomized manner) for Spetzler-Martin grading and determination of associated vascular pathological features. RESULTS: Forty-one arteriovenous malformations were assessed in 40 patients. Contrast-enhanced (CE) SLINKY MR angiography was the most consistent MR imaging technique, yielding a 95% correlation with the Spetzler-Martin classification defined by conventional catheter angiography; MR DSA exhibited 90% agreement, and SLINKY MR angiography exhibited 81% agreement. CE SLINKY MR angiography provided improved nidus delineation, compared with non-CE SLINKY MR angiography. Dynamic information from MR DSA significantly improved the observation of early-draining veins and associated aneurysms. CONCLUSION: CE SLINKY MR angiographic assessment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations offers significant advantages, compared with the use of non-CE SLINKY MR angiography, including improved nidus demonstration. MR DSA shows promise as a noninvasive method for dynamic angiography but is presently restricted by limitations in both temporal and spatial resolution.",2007 Jul,2007,Neurosurgery,61,1 Suppl,187-96; discussion 196-7,eng,False,10.1227/01.neu.0000279215.07763.a1;00006123-200707001-00010;10.1227/01.neu.0000279215.07763.a1,Journal Article,,
20569624,Endovascular therapy followed by stereotactic radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"Pre-radiosurgical embolization was carried out using cyanoacrylate in seven of 13 patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) treated by stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) with a linear accelerator (LINAC). The aim of embolization before SRS was the reduction of AVM volume and/or the elimination of vascular structures bearing an increased risk of haemorrhage. Staged-volume SRS was also performed in two patients because of residual irregular shaped nidus of AVMs even after the embolizations. Complete obliteration of the AVM nidus on angiogram was presented in five patients with embolizations (including one with staged-volume SRS) and in three of six patients with SRS alone, during follow-up periods after radiosurgery. No patients experienced haemorrhagic events after SRS. Although transient neurological symptoms were observed after embolizations in two patients, no permanent neurological deficits were presented in all patients with SRS. Pre-radiosurgical embolization may allow the effective influence on irradiation therapy in relatively large AVMs and promote more frequent obliteration in more small sized AVMs compared to those with SRS alone. However, further study must be needed to determine whether staged-volume SRS provides a high rate of AVM obliteration and its safeness.",2006 Jan 20,2006,"Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology,",12,Suppl 1,163-6,eng,False,IN.v12.Suppl;10.1177/15910199060120S128,Journal Article,,

39171929,Stereotactic Radiosurgery With Versus Without Neoadjuvant Endovascular Embolization for Brain Arteriovenous Malformations With Associated Intracranial Aneurysms.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) with neoadjuvant embolization is a treatment strategy for brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), especially for those with large nidal volume or concomitant aneurysms. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of pre-SRS embolization in AVMs with an associated intracranial aneurysm (IA). METHODS: The International Radiosurgery Research Foundation AVM database from 1987 to 2018 was retrospectively reviewed. SRS-treated AVMs with IAs were included. Patients were categorized into those treated with upfront embolization (E + SRS) vs stand-alone SRS (SRS). Primary end point was a favorable outcome (AVM obliteration + no permanent radiation-induced changes or post-SRS hemorrhage). Secondary outcomes included AVM obliteration, mortality, follow-up modified Rankin Scale, post-SRS hemorrhage, and radiation-induced changes. RESULTS: Forty four AVM patients with associated IAs were included, of which 23 (52.3%) underwent pre-SRS embolization and 21 (47.7%) SRS only. Significant differences between the E + SRS vs SRS groups were found for AVM maximum diameter (1.5 ± 0.5 vs 1.1 ± 0.4 cm3, P = .019) and SRS treatment volume (9.3 ± 8.3 vs 4.3 ± 3.3 cm3, P = .025). A favorable outcome was achieved in 45.4% of patients in the E + SRS group and 38.1% in the SRS group (P = .625). Obliteration rates were comparable (56.5% for E + SRS vs 47.6% for SRS, P = .555), whereas a higher mortality rate was found in the SRS group (19.1% vs 0%, P = .048). After adjusting for AVM maximum diameter, SRS treatment volume, and maximum radiation dose, the likelihood of achieving favorable outcome and AVM obliteration did not differ between groups (P = .475 and P = .820, respectively). CONCLUSION: The likelihood of a favorable outcome and AVM obliteration after SRS with neoadjuvant embolization in AVMs with concomitant IA seems to be comparable with stand-alone SRS, even after adjusting for AVM volume and SRS maximum dose. However, the increased mortality among the stand-alone SRS group and relatively low risk of embolization-related complications suggest that these patients may benefit from a combined treatment approach.",2024 Aug 22,2024,Neurosurgery,,,,eng,True,10.1227/neu.0000000000003152;00006123-990000000-01315;10.1227/neu.0000000000003152,Journal Article,,
38440377,Feasibility of awake craniotomy for brain arteriovenous malformations: A scoping review.,"BACKGROUND: Brain Arteriovenous Malformations (AVMs) located in proximity to eloquent brain regions are associated with poor surgical outcomes, which may be due to higher rates of postoperative neurological deterioration. Current treatment protocols include stereotactic radiosurgery, transarterial embolization, and surgical resection under general anesthesia. Awake Craniotomy (AC) allows intraoperative mapping of eloquent areas to improve post-operative neurologic outcomes. OBJECTIVES: We reviewed the current literature reporting surgical outcomes and assessed the feasibility of AC for AVM resection. METHODS: The PRISMA guidelines were utilized as a template for the review. Three databases including PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library were searched using a predefined search strategy. After removing duplicates and screening, full texts were analyzed. Outcomes including the extent of resection, intra-operative and post-operative complications, and long-term neurologic outcomes were assessed. RESULTS: 12 studies were included with a total of 122 AVM cases. Spetzler-Martin grading was used for the classification of the AVMs. The asleep-awake-asleep protocol was most commonly used for AC. Complete resection was achieved in all cases except 5. Intraoperative complications included seizures (n = 2) and bleeding (n = 4). Short-term post-operative complications included hemorrhage (n = 3), neurologic dysfunctions including paresis (n = 3), hemiplegia (n = 10), dysphasia/aphasia (n = 6), cranial nerve dysfunction (n = 3), and pulmonary embolism (n = 1). Almost all neurological deficits after surgery gradually improved on subsequent follow-ups. CONCLUSION: AVMs may shift the anatomical location of eloquent brain areas which may be mapped during AC. All studies recommended AC for the resection of AVMs in close proximity to eloquent areas as mapping during AC identifies the eloquent cortex thus promoting careful tissue handling which may preserve neurologic function and/or predict the postoperative functional status of the patients We, therefore, conclude that AC is a viable modality for AVMs resection near eloquent language and motor areas.",2024 Apr,2024,World neurosurgery: X,22,,100321,eng,False,10.1016/j.wnsx.2024.100321;100321;S2590-1397(24)00052-8;100321;10.1016/j.wnsx.2024.100321,Journal Article;Review,,Arteriovenous malformations;Awake craniotomy;Awake surgery;Neurologic outcomes;Surgical outcomes
36035052,Curative Embolization of Small Brain Arteriovenous Malformations by Ethyl Vinyl Alcohol Copolymer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"The right choice in treating small (Spetzler-Ponce grade A) brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is a matter of debate with varying views from neurology, neurosurgery, and interventional neuroradiology points of view. The Spetzler-Martin 1 and 2 brain AVMs, especially those in eloquent and deep areas that are difficult to access by micro-neurosurgery, are most suitable for a complete cure by endovascular embolization with ethyl vinyl alcohol (EVOH)-based agents. A literature search was done with keywords such as endovascular embolization of small brain AVM. Data from 13 articles are included in the study based on predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Meta-analysis for the complete cure rate was done, publication bias was removed, and regression analysis showed a 76% cure rate with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Major complications were hemorrhage and neurological deficit, which ranged from 0-20% and 0-16% with a mean proportion of 0.11 and 0.09, respectively. Long-term (3-6 months) follow-up data showed 0-4% recurrence at three months, 0-8% recurrence at six months, and 2-10% permanent disability. The mortality rate ranged from 3% to 4%. Three illustrative cases with data from the author's institute are included in the article. To conclude, endovascular embolization for small brain AVMs is a satisfactory treatment modality, however, prospective registries and randomized controlled trials involving embolization versus neurosurgery and/or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) may validate the role of embolization in small brain AVMs as curative treatment.",2022 Jul,2022,Cureus,14,7,e27219,eng,False,10.7759/cureus.27219;e27219;10.7759/cureus.27219,Journal Article;Review,,arteriovenous malformation;complete cure rate;embolization;onyx;spetzler-martin
32656149,N-Butyl Cyanoacrylate Transvenous Arteriovenous Malformation Embolization with Arterial Balloon Assistance: Defining Parameters for a Transvenous Approach as a Potential Upfront Treatment Option in Managing Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformations.,"Complete obliteration of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) using a transvenous approach as the primary and stand-alone treatment modality has been increasingly considered as a useful endovascular approach in the treatment of AVMs. AVMs are typically treated with microsurgery, stereotactic radiosurgery, endovascular embolization, or some combination of the three methods. Preservation of the draining vein is a key requisite common to all treatment modalities. Transvenous embolization (TVE) is conventionally not recommended as a stand-alone treatment for the vast majority of AVMs and has been thought to be best indicated when traditional approaches are considered less safe and when specific evaluation criteria are met. We report a case of a 35-year-old asymptomatic male diagnosed with a small intracranial AVM adjacent to the right motor strip which was managed utilizing this approach. We employed endovascular embolization via a transvenous approach with arterial balloon assistance due to the small size of the nidus, eloquent location, en passage arterial supply proximal to the venous varix, and a single draining vein from the fistula. This case illustrates the selective indications and technical nuances of TVE approach in managing AVMs as a potential upfront treatment option. When patients harbor AVMs with specific angio-architectural findings as outlined, TVE utilizing Onyx or N-butyl cyanoacrylate can be safely performed as a primary treatment modality.",2020 Apr-Jun,2020,Asian journal of neurosurgery,15,2,434-439,eng,False,10.4103/ajns.AJNS_357_19;AJNS-15-434;10.4103/ajns.AJNS_357_19,Case Reports;Journal Article,,Arteriovenous malformation;balloon assistance;transvenous embolization

Recent progress in neuroimaging technology, such as advanced MRI and CT, provides non-invasive methods to accurately diagnose DAVF, including evaluation of the hemodynamics of the drainage veins. The clinical manifestations of DAVFs vary widely and depend on the location and venous drainage pattern of arteriovenous shunting. Patients with high grade DAVFs having cortical venous reflux should receive aggressive treatment to prevent the occurrence of intracranial hemorrhage and other neurological deficits related to venous congestion. Intra-arterial or intravenous endovascular embolization remains the primary therapy for high grade DAVF, while open surgery and stereotactic radiosurgery can serve as alternative treatment options.

Its application has resulted in lowering the morbidity and mortality associated with treatment of deep-seated AVMs. SRS has been used as a primary modality of therapy as well as in conjunction with embolization and microsurgery in the management of AVMs. The obliteration rate after SRS has been reported to range from 35% to 92%. Smaller AVMs receiving higher marginal doses have obliteration rates of 70% and more. The median follow-up reported in most series is approximately 36-40 months. The median time to obliteration has been reported to be approximately 24-36 months in most series. Radiation-induced neurological complications have been reported in less than 10% of patients, with a 1.5%-6% risk of developing a new permanent neurological deficit. The bleeding rate during the latency to obliteration has been reported to be approximately 5%.

26029032,Dynamic CT angiography for cyberknife radiosurgery planning of intracranial arteriovenous malformations: a technical/feasibility report.,"BACKGROUND: Successful radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) requires accurate nidus delineation in the 3D treatment planning system (TPS). The catheter biplane digital subtraction angiogram (DSA) has traditionally been the gold standard for evaluation of the AVM nidus, but its 2D nature limits its value for contouring and it cannot be imported into the Cyberknife TPS. We describe a technique for acquisition and integration of 3D dynamic CT angiograms (dCTA) into the Cyberknife TPS for intracranial AVMs and review the feasibility of using this technique in the first patient cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Dynamic continuous whole brain CT images were acquired in a Toshiba 320 volume CT scanner with data reconstruction every 0.5 sec. This multi-time-point acquisition enabled us to choose the CT data-set with the clearest nidus without significant enhancement of surrounding blood vessels. This was imported to the Cyberknife TPS and co-registered with planning CT and T2 MRI (2D DSA adjacent for reference). The feasibility of using dCTA was evaluated in the first thirteen patients with outcome evaluation from patient records. RESULTS: dCTA data was accurately co-registered in the Cyberknife TPS and appeared to assist in nidus contouring for all patients. Imaging modalities were complementary. 85% of patients had complete (6/13) or continuing partial nidus obliteration (5/13) at 37 months median follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: dCTA is a promising imaging technique that can be successfully imported into the Cyberknife TPS and appears to assist in radiosurgery nidus definition. Further study to validate its role is warranted.",2015 Jun,2015,Radiology and oncology,49,2,192-9,eng,False,10.1515/raon-2015-0006;rado-49-02-192;10.1515/raon-2015-0006,Journal Article,,Cyberknife;arteriovenous malformation;dynamic CT angiogram;radiosurgery

28955512,Effectiveness of Preradiosurgical Embolization with NBCA for Arteriovenous Malformations - Retrospective Outcome Analysis in a Japanese Registry of 73 Patients (J-REAL study).,"PURPOSE: Recent reports have posed doubts about the effect of preradiosurgical embolization in brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM) because it makes the planning of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) difficult and has the risk of recanalization out of the target. We investigated whether the performance and quality of embolization may influence the success of SRS based on a retrospective case cohort study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-three patients who underwent embolization followed by SRS between 2003 and 2012 in eight institutes with neurointerventionists were considered. They were divided into the following two groups at 3 years of follow up after the final SRS: ""successful occlusion group"" (S group), with radiologically complete occlusion of AVM; and ""non-successful occlusion group"" (N group) with persistent remnant nidus or abnormal vascular networks. Patient background, AVM profile, embolization performance grade and complications were compared in each group. The quality of embolization was evaluated with the new grading system: embolization performance grade (E grade), specializing the achievement of nidus embolization. E grade A was defined as sufficient nidus embolization with more than half of the total number of feeders achieving nidus penetration. E grade B was defined as less than half achievement of nidus embolization, and E grade C was defines as failure to perform nidus embolization. RESULTS: Forty-three patients were included in the S group, and 29 patients were included in the N group. The size and Spetzler-Martin grade of AVM and the rate of diffuse type was higher in the N group without statistical significance. The embolization performance level according to E grade indicated a significantly higher rate of successful embolization with more than 50% of nidus penetration in the S group (P<0.001). This difference was also confirmed in the subanalysis for limited cases, excluding smaller AVMs with complete occlusion with SRS alone (P=0.001). CONCLUSION: The cause of the unsuccessful result of post-embolization SRS might be the large, diffuse angioarchitecture, but proper embolization with a high rate of nidus penetration to avoid recanalization is more important. Effective embolization is essential to contribute to and promote the effect of radiosurgery.",2017 Sep,2017,Neurointervention,12,2,100-109,eng,True,10.5469/neuroint.2017.12.2.100;10.5469/neuroint.2017.12.2.100,Journal Article,,Arteriovenous malformation;Embolization;Nidus;Quality;Radiosurgery
22826813,Hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for large arteriovenous malformations.,"Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are abnormal connections between the arteries and veins, with possible serious consequences of intracranial hemorrhage. The curative treatment for AVMs includes microsurgery and radiosurgery, sometimes with embolization as an adjunct. However, controversies exist with the treatment options available for large to giant AVMs. Hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT) is one treatment option for such difficult lesions. We aim to review recent literature, looking at the treatment outcome of HSRT in terms of AVM obliteration rate and complications. The rate of AVM obliteration utilizing HSRT as a primary treatment was comparable with that of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). For those not totally obliterated, HSRT makes them smaller and turns some lesions manageable by single-dose SRS or microsurgery. Higher doses per fraction seemed to exhibit better response. However, patients receiving higher total dose may be at risk for higher rates of complications. Fractionated regimens of 7 Gy × 4 and 6-6.5 Gy × 5 may be accepted compromises between obliteration and complication. Embolization may not be beneficial prior to HSRT in terms of obliteration rate or the volume reduction. Future work should aim on a prospectively designed study for larger patient groups and long-term follow-up results.",2012,2012,Surgical neurology international,3,Suppl 2,S105-10,eng,False,10.4103/2152-7806.95421;SNI-3-105;10.4103/2152-7806.95421,Journal Article,,Arteriovenous malformation;hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy;radiosurgery
20587250,Embolization of Arteriovenous Malformation. Efficacy and Safety of Preoperative Embolization Followed by Surgical Resection of AVM.,"Treatment options for cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) are still controversial due to the recent result of stereotactic radiosurgery and the improved result of microsurgical resection. We investigated previously treated AVM cases and discussed the efficacy and safety of preoperative embolization especially for microsurgical resection of high-grade AVM in the Spetzler-Martin grading. Efficacy of preoperative embolization was evaluated based on 126 previously treated AVM cases at Shinshu University Hospital during the last 25 years. The safety of embolization was evaluated based on our previously-embolized 58 AVM cases (91 procedures) in the last 11 years after introduction of preoperative embolization for AVM. In all 126 cases, 82 were treated before introduction of embolization and 44 were treated after introduction of embolization. In 82 cases of the pre-embolization era, 63 lesions were removed totally in 63 AVMs (77%), partially resected in 11 (13%) and untreated in eight (10%). In 74 surgically removed cases, 11 (15%) cases showed severe intra/postoperative bleeding. In 44 cases of the embolization era, lesions were removed totally in 29 AVMs (66%), disappeared only with embolization in one (2%), disappeared with radiosurgery in seven (16%) and were untreated in five (11%). In 32 surgically removed cases, only one (2%) case showed severe intra/postoperative bleeding. In all 58 embolized cases, 44 were surgically removed, six were treated with radiosurgery, one was eliminated with embolization alone and six were partially obliterated and followed up for their location. In 91 procedures for 58 cases, two haemorrhagic and three ischemic complications occurred, three were transient and two remained having neurological deficits. The introduction of preoperative embolization improved the total removal rate and reduced the intra/postoperative bleeding rate in surgical removal of AVM. The total risk of embolization is low and well-designed preoperative embolization makes surgical resection safer even in high-grade AVM in the Spetzler-Martin grading.",2004 Dec 24,2004,"Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology,",10 Suppl 2,Suppl 2,54-8,eng,False,IN.v10.Suppl;10.1177/15910199040100S211,Journal Article,,

39377594,Headache and Visual Aura Outcomes After Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Patients With Occipital Lobe Arteriovenous Malformations: A Single-Center Retrospective Cohort Study.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Patients with brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVMs) sometimes experience migraine-like chronic headaches. Reportedly, this symptom is common in occipital lobe BAVMs; however, the exact prevalence has not been clarified, and the details of visual auras have been scarcely reported. Furthermore, no comprehensive studies exist on the improvement of migraine associated with visual auras in occipital lobe BAVMs after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Therefore, this study investigated the prevalence of headache with visual aura in patients with occipital lobe BAVMs and evaluated the impact of SRS on preexisting symptoms. METHODS: As a single-center retrospective cohort study, a total of 104 patients with occipital lobe BAVMs treated with SRS from 1990 to 2024 were analyzed. Pre-SRS and post-SRS symptoms of headache and visual aura were documented. The outcomes measured were headache severity, frequency, aura characteristics, and BAVM obliteration rates. RESULTS: Of the 104 patients, 41 (39%) reported chronic headache pre-SRS, and 37 (36%) experienced migraine with visual aura. Compared with pre-SRS, 90% (28/31) of the patients experienced a >50% reduction in headache severity and frequency at a median follow-up of 11 months, and 89% (25/28) experienced a >50% reduction in aura frequency. Complete headache remission was achieved in 35% (13/31) of patients. Complete obliteration of BAVMs was confirmed in 75% (76/102) of the patients at a median of 33 months. A smaller nidus volume was associated with both complete headache remission and BAVM obliteration, whereas age and sex were not significant predictors of headache outcome. CONCLUSION: Patients with occipital lobe BAVMs frequently experience migraine-like headaches with visual aura, which may be more prevalent than in the general population. SRS for occipital lobe BAVMs could not only achieve favorable BAVM obliteration with minimal adverse effects but also significantly improve migraine-like symptoms, including visual aura, particularly in patients with smaller nidus volumes.",2024 Oct 8,2024,Neurosurgery,,,,eng,True,10.1227/neu.0000000000003212;00006123-990000000-01383;10.1227/neu.0000000000003212,Journal Article,,
38108313,Third Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Residual Arteriovenous Malformations: A Retrospective Multicenter Study.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: There are no studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of more than 2 stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) procedures for cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM). The aim of this study was to provide evidence on the role of third single-session SRS for AVM residual. METHODS: This multicenter, retrospective study included patients managed with a third single-session SRS procedure for an AVM residual. The primary study outcome was defined as AVM nidus obliteration without AVM bleeding or symptomatic radiation-induced changes (RIC). Secondary outcomes evaluated were AVM obliteration, AVM hemorrhage, asymptomatic, and symptomatic RIC. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients (20/38 [52.6%] females, median age at third SRS 34.5 [IQR 20] years) were included. The median clinical follow-up was 46 (IQR 14.8) months, and 17/38 (44.7%) patients achieved favorable outcome. The 3-year and 5-year cumulative probability rates of favorable outcome were 23% (95% CI = 10%-38%) and 53% (95% CI = 29%-73%), respectively. The cumulative probability of AVM obliteration at 3 and 5 years after the third SRS was 23% (95% CI = 10%-37%) and 54% (95% CI = 29%-74%), respectively. AVM bleeding occurred in 2 patients, and 1 of them underwent subsequent resection. The cumulative probability rate of post-SRS AVM hemorrhage remained constant at 5.3% (95% CI = 1%-16%) during the first 5 years of follow-up. Transient symptomatic RIC managed conservatively occurred in 5/38 patients (13.2%) at a median time of 12.5 (IQR 22.5) months from third SRS. Radiation-induced cyst formation was noted in 1 patient (4.2%) 19 months post-SRS. No mortality, radiation-associated malignancy, or permanent symptomatic RIC was noted during follow-up. CONCLUSION: A third single-session SRS to treat a residual intracranial AVM offers obliteration in most patients. The risk of RIC was low, and these effects were transient. While not often required, a third SRS can be performed in patients with persistent residual AVMs.",2023 Dec 18,2023,Neurosurgery,,,,eng,True,10.1227/neu.0000000000002805;00006123-990000000-01004;10.1227/neu.0000000000002805,Journal Article,,
36253875,"Multimodality treatment for brain arteriovenous malformation in Mainland China: design, rationale, and baseline patient characteristics of a nationwide multicenter prospective registry.","BACKGROUND: Brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is an important cause of hemorrhagic stroke in young adults, which can lead to severe neurological impairment. The registry of Multimodality treatment for brain ArTeriovenous malformation in mainland CHina (MATCH) is a national prospective registry to identify the natural history of AVMs in Asian population; to investigate traditional and emerging hemorrhagic predictors; and to explore the superiority of the multidisciplinary assessment in improving the long-term outcomes. METHODS: Consecutive AVM patients will be enrolled from 52 participating hospitals in mainland China. Baseline demographic, clinical and imaging data will be collected prospectively. Conservation, microsurgery, embolization, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), and multimodal strategies are all included in this study. Patients will be divided into experimental and control group according to whether the treatment protocols are formulated by multidisciplinary team. Neurofunctional status, subsequent hemorrhage, seizure, and novel neurofunctional deficit will be queried at 3 months, annually (1 and 2 years), 3 years, and 10 years follow-up. RESULTS: Between August 2011 and April 2021, 3241 AVMs were enrolled in 11 participating sites. Among them, 59.0% were male with an average age of 28.4 ± 14.6 years, 61.2% had rupture history and 2268 hemorrhagic events occurred before admission. The median Spetzler-Martin grade and Lawton-Young grade was 3 and 5, respectively. Microsurgery is the dominant strategy (35.7%), with a similar proportion of embolization, SRS, and a combination of both (12.7%; 14.8%; 11.8%; respectively). Among them, 15.43% underwent multidisciplinary assessment and received standardized treatment. At the most recent follow-up, 7.8% were lost and the median follow-up duration was 5.6 years. CONCLUSIONS: The MATCH study is a large-sample nationwide prospective registry to investigate multimodality management strategy for AVMs. Data from this registry may also provide the opportunity for individualized risk assessment and the development of optimal individual management strategies.

36861001,Nidus delineation and dosimetric comparison in arteriovenous malformation in stereotactic radiosurgery by using MRI and 3DCT angiography.,"PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: Accurate delineation of target is key to any successful radiosurgery. C-arm Dyna CT/ 3DCT angiography (3DCTA) has the potential of improving the accuracy of nidus delineation in intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVM) due to high temporo-spatial resolution of vessel architecture. Here, we present a comparison of nidus delineation and dosimetric parameters between digital 3DCTA and MRI. MATERIALS/METHODS: Ten consecutive patients treated for intracranial AVMs were included in this study. All patients underwent MRI/MRA, and 3DCTA and all images were co-registered. AVM were delineated using 3DCTA (GTV(3DCTA)) and contrast enhanced MRI/MRA (GTV(MRI)). Hausdorff distance (HD) matrices and dice similarity coefficient (DSC) matrices were analysed. Stereotactic radiosurgery plans were developed for both the volumes for all patients and statistical analysis were performed with T-test. RESULTS: Mean volumes of GTV(3DCTA) and GTV(MRI) were 1.771 cc (SD 1.794cc, range 0.124-4.191cc) and 2.183cc (SD 2.16cc, range 0.221-6.133cc), respectively. Significant deviation (p=0.018) was found when taking GTV(MRI) as a primary and comparing it to GTV(3DCTA) (MD=0.723cc±0.816cc). Similar result was observed with GTV(3DCTA) as primary and GTV(MRI) as secondary (MD=0.188cc, SD=0.193cc, p=0.024). Maximum HD was in the range of 1.71 to 7.44mm (mean=4.27mm, SD=1.56). For GTV(3DCTA) based plans, significant deviation was found between GTV(MRI) and GTV(3DCTA) in dose coverage and the mean difference was 22.17% (SD 16.73). In GTV(MRI) based plans, the mean CIRTOG deteriorated from 1.33 to 2.18 for GTV(MRI) and GTV(3DCTA), respectively. Significant deviation was found in CI(RTOG) (0.005) and mean deviation was 0.86(SD=0.72) when comparing GTV(MRI) and GTV(3DCTA). Highly significant (p=0.002) deviation was found in CI(Paddick) between GTV(MRI) and GTV(3DCTA) for GTV(MRI) based plans with mean difference of 0.26(SD=0.4, for GTV(MRI)=0.3, GTV(3DCTA)=0.46). CONCLUSION: Nidus volume was significantly altered with the use of 3DCTA compared to that of MRA/MRI images.

34853738,Surgical Treatment of Dural Arteriovenous Fistula: A Case Report and Literature Review.,"Dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVF) are rare, acquired intracranial arteriovenous malformations consisting of a pathological shunt located within the intracranial dura matter. The etiology of dAVFs remains unclear, but current thought suggests that these lesions are associated with thrombosis of the dural sinuses and other intracranial veins. dAVF's with severe symptomatology or high-risk angioarchitecture should be treated without delay, and endovascular repair is generally accepted as the first-line treatment. Both transarterial and transvenous approaches can be used to cure dAVFs. Surgery and stereotactic radiosurgery may also be used when endovascular approaches are unsuccessful or not feasible. Some studies, however, have shown that surgery for dAVFs in the anterior cranial fossa is preferred over the endovascular approach. Due to the proximity of some dAVFs to the orbit, endovascular embolization of the dAVF carries a higher risk of complications, primarily due to the formation of dangerous extracranial or intracranial anastomoses. We present the case of a 64-year-old male with an incidentally discovered Borden type III dAVF arising from the anterior branches of the middle meningeal artery and draining into the middle cerebral vein. Due to the location of his dAVF, craniotomy was selected for ligation of the fistula. The procedure went without complication. A catheter angiogram of the brain one month after surgery showed an absence of flow through the arteriovenous fistula and a middle meningeal artery that had returned to its normal caliber.",2021 Oct,2021,Cureus,13,10,e18995,eng,False,10.7759/cureus.18995;e18995;10.7759/cureus.18995,Case Reports;Journal Article,,3d model in neurosurgery;brain vascular disease;catheter angiogram;dural arteriovenous fistulas;endovascular intervention
34189463,Proof-of-concept single-arm trial of bevacizumab therapy for brain arteriovenous malformation.,"Brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) are relatively rare, although their potential for secondary intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) makes their diagnosis and management essential to the community. Currently, invasive therapies (surgical resection, stereotactic radiosurgery and endovascular embolisation) are the only interventions that offer a reduction in ICH risk. There is no designated medical therapy for bAVM, although there is growing animal and human evidence supporting a role for bevacizumab to reduce the size of AVMs. In this single-arm pilot study, two patients with large bAVMs (deemed unresectable by an interdisciplinary team) received bevacizumab 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks for 12 weeks. Due to limitations of external funding, the intended sample size of 10 participants was not reached. Primary outcome measure was change in bAVM volume from baseline at 26 and 52 weeks. No change in bAVM volume was observed 26 or 52 weeks after bevacizumab treatment. No clinically important adverse events were observed during the 52-week study period. There were no observed instances of ICH. Sera vascular endothelial growth factor levels were reduced at 26 weeks and returned to baseline at 52 weeks. This pilot study is the first to test bevacizumab for patients with bAVMs. Bevacizumab therapy was well tolerated in both subjects. No radiographic changes were observed over the 52-week study period. Subsequent larger clinical trials are in order to assess for dose-dependent efficacy and rarer adverse drug effects.

33531780,Gamma Knife Radiosurgery for Berry Aneurysms: Quo Vadis.,"Background Intracranial aneurysms are vascular malformations with significant mortality and morbidity profile. Various treatment modalities have been developed to positively impact the outcome profile with gradual shift to the minimally invasive treatment modalities. Gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) is an established primary treatment modality for various intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs); however, its efficacy for berry aneurysmal obliteration has been historically dismal. Objective The aim of this study is to evaluate the factors responsible for poor radio surgical outcome for intracranial aneurysms. Methods The literature is reviewed for the differential efficacy of GKRS for aneurysm and AVM. Results Though both are vascular malformations, aneurysm and AVM have inherent differences in angioarchitecture, intracranial location, surrounding neighborhood, radio-sensitivity, and latency for obliteration. The major difference arises because of surrounding neighborhood of connective tissue stroma which stabilizes the irradiated pathology. Conclusion Though considered radioresistant, aneurysms show promising results with animal models of radiosurgery. The future lies in two hypothetical improvements: with a supporting neighborhood or sensitization of the vessel wall that may change the natural history of an aneurysm, especially an unruptured one.",2021 Jan,2021,Journal of neurosciences in rural practice,12,1,182-184,eng,False,10.1055/s-0040-1716795;JNRP2060890;10.1055/s-0040-1716795,Journal Article,,aneurysm;arteriovenous malformation;cavernoma;fistula;radiation;radiosurgery
32032957,Stereotactic radiosurgery for pediatric brain arteriovenous malformations: long-term outcomes.,"OBJECTIVE: Contrary to the better described obliteration- and hemorrhage-related data after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in pediatric patients, estimates of the rarer complications, including cyst and tumor formation, are limited in the literature. The aim of the present study was to assess the long-term outcomes and risks of SRS for AVMs in pediatric patients (age < 18 years). METHODS: The authors retrospectively analyzed the International Radiosurgery Research Foundation pediatric AVM database for the years 1987 to 2018. AVM obliteration, post-SRS hemorrhage, cyst formation, and tumor formation were assessed. Cumulative probabilities, adjusted for the competing risk of death, were calculated. RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 539 pediatric AVM patients (mean follow-up 85.8 months). AVM obliteration was observed in 64.3% of patients, with cumulative probabilities of 63.6% (95% CI 58.8%-68.0%), 77.1% (95% CI 72.1%-81.3%), and 88.1% (95% CI 82.5%-92.0%) over 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively. Post-SRS hemorrhage was observed in 8.4% of patients, with cumulative probabilities of 4.9% (95% CI 3.1%-7.2%), 9.7% (95% CI 6.4%-13.7%), and 14.5% (95% CI 9.5%-20.5%) over 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively. Cyst formation was observed in 2.1% of patients, with cumulative probabilities of 5.5% (95% CI 2.3%-10.7%) and 6.9% (95% CI 3.1%-12.9%) over 10 and 15 years, respectively. Meningiomas were observed in 2 patients (0.4%) at 10 and 12 years after SRS, with a cumulative probability of 3.1% (95% CI 0.6%-9.7%) over 15 years. CONCLUSIONS: AVM obliteration can be expected after SRS in the majority of the pediatric population, with a relatively low risk of hemorrhage during the latency period. Cyst and benign tumor formation after SRS can be observed in 7% and 3% of patients over 15 years, respectively.

25371789,Cerebral arteriovenous malformation associated with moyamoya disease.,"The coexistence of moyamoya disease (MMD) with an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is exceedingly rare. We report two cases of AVM associated with MMD. The first case was an incidental AVM diagnosed simultaneously with MMD. This AVM was managed expectantly after encephalo-duro-arterio-synangiosis (EDAS) as the main feeders stemmed from the internal carotid artery, which we believed would be obliterated with the progression of MMD. However, the AVM persisted with replacement of the internal carotid artery feeders by new external carotid artery feeders from the EDAS site. The AVM was eventually treated with gamma knife radiosurgery considering an increasing steal effect. The second case was a de novo AVM case. The patient was initially diagnosed with MMD, and acquired an AVM eight years later that was slowly fed by the reconstituted anterior cerebral artery. Because the patient remained asymptomatic, the AVM is currently being closely followed for more than 2 years without further surgical intervention. Possible differences in the pathogenesis and the radiologic presentation of these AVMs are discussed with a literature review. No solid consensus exists on the optimal treatment of MMD-associated AVMs. Gamma knife radiosurgery appears to be an effective treatment option for an incidental AVM. However, a de novo AVM may be managed expectantly considering the possible risks of damaging established collaterals, low flow characteristics, and probably low risks of rupture.",2014 Oct,2014,Journal of Korean Neurosurgical Society,56,4,356-60,eng,False,10.3340/jkns.2014.56.4.356;10.3340/jkns.2014.56.4.356,Case Reports;Journal Article,,Arteriovenous malformation;Children;Moyamoya disease;Pediatric

At 24 months, the signal abnormalities finally disappeared, indicating complete obliteration of the nidus.

21368695,Outcomes of radiosurgery for brainstem arteriovenous malformations.,"BACKGROUND: Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in the brainstem yield a high risk of hemorrhage. Although stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is accepted, because of high surgical morbidity and mortality, outcomes are still unclear. OBJECTIVE: We previously reported the early results of SRS for brainstem AVMs. Here, we obtained data from a longer follow-up for a larger number of patients and present precise outcomes based on the latest follow-up data. METHODS: Forty-four patients with brainstem AVMs were treated by SRS. Outcomes such as the rates of obliteration, hemorrhage after treatment, and adverse effects were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The annual hemorrhage rate before SRS was 17.5%. The mean follow-up period after SRS was 71 months (range, 2-168 months). The actuarial obliteration rate confirmed by angiography was 52% at 5 years. Factors associated with higher obliteration rate were previous hemorrhage (P = .048) and higher margin dose (P = .048). For patients treated with a margin dose of ≥ 18 Gy, the obliteration rate was 71% at 5 years. Persistent worsening of neurological symptoms was observed in 5%. The annual hemorrhage rate after SRS was 2.4%. Four patients died of rebleeding, and disease-specific survival rate was 86% at 10 years after treatment. CONCLUSION: Nidus obliteration must be achieved for brainstem AVMs because they possibly cause lethal hemorrhage even after SRS.

36600776,Gamma Knife radiosurgery - 12 years of experience in a high-complexity center of a middle-income country.,"BACKGROUND: Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKR) is a technique that consists of the release of a high dose of ionizing radiation onto a therapeutic target, which has been previously delimited. This technique was described by Lars Leksell and Borje Larsson in 1951. In Colombia, there is only one GKR unit functioning machine nowadays. The objective of this study is to describe the institutional experience of a single institution with Gamma Knife Perfexion over 12 years. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study. A total of 1906 medical records, taken from the period between May 4, 2010, and May 4, 2022, were included in the study. Descriptive analysis was performed through STATA 17 as statistic tool. Measures of central tendency were calculated depending on the distribution of the continuous data and proportions were taken into account in the case of qualitative variables. RESULTS: A total of 1906 procedures were performed. Patients from 1 year to 99 years old were treated, with a median age of 51 years. The most frequent diagnoses were meningioma (20.8%), arteriovenous malformation (AVM) (17%), vestibular schwannoma (15.6%), metastases (9.81%), and trigeminal neuralgia (9.12%). At 3-year posttreatment, in meningiomas, tumor size stability was observed in 57.3%, size decrease in 36%, and disappearance in 1.3%. In AVM, complete obliteration of the lesion was described in 36.8% and a decrease in size in 52.6%. Intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 5.2% during the follow-up period and 3.5% of all treated patients required a new procedure due to residual malformation. In vestibular schwannomas, tumor size remained stable in 62.2% and decreased in 28.8%. No new cases of facial paralysis after the procedure were described. At 1-year posttreatment, in metastasis, the size of the lesions remained stable in 40% of the patients, decreased in 47.5%, and disappeared in 2.5%. In trigeminal neuralgia, 88.4% of patients had pain relief and recurrences occurred in 16.6%. Acute complications were generally uncommon, the main ones being headache, pain at frame fixation points, and nausea.

29296391,Angiographic characteristics of epileptogenic arteriovenous malformations and effectiveness in the seizure control after treatment with radiosurgery.,"OBJETIVE: Define the angiographic characteristics of epileptogenic arteriovenous malformations (AVM) and assess symptom control of the seizure after treatment with radiosurgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 1996 and 2006, a total of 237 adults patients were diagnosed with AVM and were treated in our center by radiosurgery with linear accelerator. We analyzed demographics, clinicals, angiographics and radiosurgicals characteristics and the complications of the procedure in each of them. The first symptom was a seizure in 68 of them and the subsequent analysis of the treatment effectiveness for the seizure control was done, and the possible predictive factors of AVM nidus evolution were assessed. RESULT: The average volume of the epileptogenic AVMs was 7.17 cc, compared ot the non-epileptogenic AVM 5.06 cc (p<0.03). Other differentiating factors were surface blood supply (p<0.003), venous ectasia (p<0.064), angiogenesis (p<0.078), and the presence of unrelated aneurysms (p<0.08). For 68 patients (28.7%) with seizures a clinical control (Seizure Frequency Scoring System SFSS ≤2) was obtained in 70% of patients and there was an excellent control (SFSS ≤1) in 25% of them. The percent occlusion of their AVMs was 50%. There was statistical significance with SFSS ≤1 (p<0.01), but was not any significance with SFSS ≤2. Age (p<0.003) and diffuse nidus morphology (p<0.05) were predictors of good AVM nidus evolution.

RESULTS: The median volume of AVM in this series was 28 cm(3) and 47 patients (48%) were Spetzler-Martin grade IV or V. Twenty-seven patients initially presented with hemorrhage. Sixty-one patients underwent multiple embolizations while a single SRS session was performed in 64 patients. The median follow-up after SRS session was 32 months (range 9-136 months). Overall procedural complications occurred in 14 patients. There were 13 minor neurologic complications and 1 major complication (due to embolization) while four patients had posttreatment hemorrhage. Thirty-eight patients (40%) were cured radiographically. The postradiosurgery actuarial rate of obliteration was 45% at 5 years, 56% at 7 years, and 63% at 10 years. In multivariate analysis, larger AVM size, deep venous drainage, and the increasing number of embolization/SRS sessions were negative predictors of obliteration. The number of embolizations correlated positively with the number of stereotactic radiosurgeries (P < 0.005).

22030421,Factors predictive of obliteration after arteriovenous malformation radiosurgery.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate predictive factors of complete obliteration following treatment with linac-based stereotactic radiosurgery for intracerebral arteriovenous malformations. METHODS: Archived plans for 48 patients treated at the British Columbia Cancer Agency and who underwent post-treatment digital subtraction angiography to assess obliteration were studied. Actuarial estimates of obliteration were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used for analysis of incidence of obliteration. Log-rank test was used to search for parameters associated with obliteration. RESULTS: Complete nidus obliteration was achieved in 38/48 patients (79.2%). Actuarial rate of obliteration was 75.9% at 4 years (95% confidence interval 63.1%-88.6%). On univariate analysis, prescribed dose to the margin (p=0.002) and dose to isocentre (p=0.022) showed statistical significance. No parameters were significant in a multivariate model. According to the log-rank test, prescribed dose to the margin of >20 Gy (p=0.004) and dose to the isocentre of >25 Gy (p=0.004) were associated with obliteration. CONCLUSION: Reported series in the literature suggest a number of different factors are predictive of complete obliteration of arteriovenous malformations following radiosurgery. However, differing definitions of volume and complete obliteration makes direct comparison between series difficult. This study demonstrates that complete obliteration of the nidus following linear accelerator-based stereotactic radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations appears to be most closely related to the prescribed marginal dose. In particular, a marginal dose of >20 Gy is strongly associated with obtaining complete obliteration of the nidus.",2011 Nov,2011,The Canadian journal of neurological sciences.

33276336,Outcomes of stereotactic radiosurgery for hemorrhagic arteriovenous malformations with or without prior resection or embolization.,"OBJECTIVE: The major concern about ruptured arteriovenous malformations (rAVMs) is recurrent hemorrhage, which tends to preclude stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) as a therapeutic modality for these brain malformations. In this study, the authors aimed to clarify the role of SRS for rAVM as a stand-alone modality and an adjunct for a remnant nidus after surgery or embolization. METHODS: Data on 410 consecutive patients with rAVMs treated with SRS were analyzed. The patients were classified into groups, according to prior interventions: SRS-alone, surgery and SRS (Surg-SRS), and embolization and SRS (Embol-SRS) groups. The outcomes of the SRS-alone group were analyzed in comparison with those of the other two groups. RESULTS: The obliteration rate was higher in the Surg-SRS group than in the SRS-alone group (5-year cumulative rate 97% vs 79%, p < 0.001), whereas no significant difference was observed between the Embol-SRS and SRS-alone groups. Prior resection (HR 1.78, 95% CI 1.30-2.43, p < 0.001), a maximum AVM diameter ≤ 20 mm (HR 1.81, 95% CI 1.43-2.30, p < 0.001), and a prescription dose ≥ 20 Gy (HR 2.04, 95% CI 1.28-3.27, p = 0.003) were associated with a better obliteration rate, as demonstrated by multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses. In the SRS-alone group, the annual post-SRS hemorrhage rates were 1.5% within 5 years and 0.2% thereafter and the 10-year significant neurological event-free rate was 95%; no intergroup difference was observed in either outcome. The exclusive performance of SRS (SRS alone) was not a risk for post-SRS hemorrhage or for significant neurological events based on multivariate analyses. These results were also confirmed with propensity score-matched analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment strategy for rAVMs should be tailored with due consideration of multiple factors associated with the patients. Stand-alone SRS is effective for hemorrhagic AVMs, and the risk of post-SRS hemorrhage was low. SRS can also be favorably used for residual AVMs after initial interventions, especially after failed resection.",2021 Sep 1,2021,Journal of neurosurgery,135,3,733-741,eng,True,10.3171/2020.7.JNS201502;10.3171/2020.7.JNS201502,Journal Article,,Gamma Knife;long-term outcomes;ruptured arteriovenous malformation;stereotactic radiosurgery;vascular disorders
34069336,Predictive Factors of Radiation-Induced Changes Following Single-Session Gamma Knife Radiosurgery for Arteriovenous Malformations.,"We evaluated for possible predictors of radiation-induced changes (RICs) after gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). We identified the nidal component within AVMs to analyze the correlation between the volume of brain parenchyma within the 50% isodose line (IDL) and RICs. We retrospectively reviewed patients with AVMs who underwent a single-session of GKRS at our institution between 2007 and 2017 with at least a 2-year minimum follow-up. Follow-up magnetic resonance images were evaluated for newly developed T2 signal changes and the proportions of nidus and intervening parenchyma were quantified. A total of 180 AVM patients (98 males and 82 females) with a median age of 34 years were included in the present study. The overall obliteration rate was 67.8%. The median target volume was 3.65 cc. The median nidus and parenchyma volumes within the 50% IDL were 1.54 cc and 2.41 cc, respectively. RICs were identified in 79 of the 180 patients (43.9%). AVMs associated with previous hemorrhages showed a significant inverse correlation with RICs. In a multivariate analysis, RICs were associated with a higher proportion of brain parenchyma within the 50% IDL (hazard ratio (HR) 169.033; p < 0.001) and inversely correlated with the proportion of nidus volume within the 50% IDL (HR 0.006; p < 0.001). Our study identified that a greater proportion of brain tissue between the nidus within the 50% IDL was significantly correlated with RICs. Nidus angioarchitectural complexity and the absence of a prior hemorrhage were also associated with RICs. The identification of possible predictors of RICs could facilitate radiosurgical planning and treatment decisions as well as the planning of appropriate follow-up after GKRS; this could minimize the risk of RICs, which would be particularly beneficial for the treatment of incidentally found asymptomatic AVMs.",2021 May 19,2021,Journal of clinical medicine,10,10,,eng,True,10.3390/jcm10102186;2186;jcm10102186;jcm-10-02186;10.3390/jcm10102186,Journal Article,,adverse radiation effect (ARE);arteriovenous malformation (AVM);cerebrovascular disease (CVD);gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS);radiation-induced change (RIC);stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)
26110078,Outcome of cerebral arteriovenous malformations after linear accelerator reirradiation.,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of patients undergoing single-dose reirradiation using the Linear Accelerator (LINAC) for brain arteriovenous malformations (AVM). METHODS: A retrospective study of 37 patients with brain AVM undergoing LINAC reirradiation between April 2003 and November 2011 was carried out. Patient characteristics, for example, gender, age, use of medications, and comorbidities; disease characteristics, for example, Spetzler-Martin grading system, location, volume, modified Pollock-Flickinger score; and treatment characteristics, for example, embolization, prescription dose, radiation dose-volume curves, and conformity index were analyzed. During the follow-up period, imaging studies were performed to evaluate changes after treatment and AVM cure. Complications, such as edema, rupture of the blood-brain barrier, and radionecrosis were classified as symptomatic and asymptomatic. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients underwent angiogram after reirradiation and the percentage of angiographic occlusion was 55.5%. In three patients without obliteration, AVM shrinkage made it possible to perform surgical resection with a 2/3 cure rate. A reduction in AVM nidus volume greater than 50% after the first procedure was shown to be the most important predictor of obliteration. Another factor associated with AVM cure was a prescription dose higher than 15.5 Gy in the first radiosurgery. Two patients had permanent neurologic deficits. Factors correlated with complications were the prescription dose and maximum dose in the first procedure. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that single-dose reirradiation is safe and feasible in partially occluded AVM. Reirradiation may not benefit candidates whose prescribed dose was lower than 15.5 Gy in the first procedure and initial AVM nidus volume did not decrease by more than 50% before reirradiation.",2015,2015,Surgical neurology international,6,,96,eng,True,10.4103/2152-7806.158205;96;SNI-6-96;10.4103/2152-7806.158205,Journal Article,,Arteriovenous malformations;radiosurgery;reirradiation
39652987,Arteriovenous malformations treated by stereotactic radiosurgery - Review of an Australian single centre's experience.,"Linear accelerator (LINAC) stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a specialised treatment used for various brain conditions, including arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). This paper investigates the obliteration rate of AVMs treated by the LINAC-based facility at Prince of Wales Hospital, defines factors influencing obliteration rate, time to obliteration and complications post-SRS. A retrospective audit review of patient notes sourced from electronic medical records was conducted. During the study period 219 patients received treatment, of which the final status of 136 AVMs was known. Overall obliteration rate was 75.7 %, with obliteration rates of 5 %, 30 % and 46 % at one, three and four years, respectively. Post analysis, a radiosurgery dose of ≥ 18 Gray (Gy) was predictive of achieving obliteration (Odds Ratio (OR) 4.2, 95 % Confidence Interval (CI) 1.61-10.83, p = 0.003) whilst a nidus size of 3-6 cm was less likely of achieving obliteration (OR 0.2, CI 0.10-0.57, p = 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed a radiosurgery dose of ≥ 18 Gy remained predictive (OR 4.7, CI 1.69-13.25, p = 0.003) and a nidus size of 3-6 cm remained less likely to achieve obliteration (OR 0.2, CI 0.10-0.57, p = 0.001). Females were predictive of developing temporary complications post-SRS in multivariate analysis (OR 2.8, CI 1.24-6.13, p = 0.013), and having > 1 SRS session was predictive of developing permanent complications post-SRS (OR 7.1, CI 2.44-20.53, p < 0.001). The obliteration rate achieved from our study and the predictive nature to achieve obliteration with a radiosurgery dose of ≥ 18 Gy is comparable to existing literature including that using the Gamma-Knife system.",2025 Feb,2025,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society,132,,110961,eng,True,S0967-5868(24)00500-9;10.1016/j.jocn.2024.110961;S0967-5868(24)00500-9;10.1016/j.jocn.2024.110961,Journal Article,Humans;*Radiosurgery/methods/adverse effects/instrumentation;Female;Male;Retrospective Studies;Adult;Middle Aged;Adolescent;Young Adult;Aged;Treatment Outcome;Australia;Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/surgery/radiotherapy;Child,AVM;Linear accelerator;Stereotactic radiosurgery;Vascular obliteration rates;post-SRS complications
39366733,Comparing stand-alone endovascular embolization versus stereotactic radiosurgery in the treatment of arteriovenous malformations with Spetzler-Martin grades I-III: a propensity score matched study.,"BACKGROUND: Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are uncommon cerebral lesions that can cause significant neurological complications. Surgical resection is the gold standard for treatment, but endovascular embolization and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) are viable alternatives. OBJECTIVE: To compare the outcomes of endovascular embolization versus SRS in the treatment of AVMs with Spetzler-Martin grades I-III. METHODS: This study combined retrospective data from 10 academic institutions in North America and Europe. Patients aged 1 to 90 years who underwent endovascular embolization or SRS for AVMs with Spetzler-Martin grades I-III between January 2010 and December 2023 were included. RESULTS: The study included 244 patients, including 84 who had endovascular embolization and 160 who had SRS. Before propensity score matching (PSM), complete obliteration at the last follow-up was achieved in 74.5% of the SRS group compared with 57.8% of the embolization group (OR=0.47; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.48; P=0.01). After propensity score matching, SRS still achieved significantly higher occlusion rates at last follow-up (78.9% vs 55.3%; OR=0.32; 95% CI 0.12 to 0.90; P=0.03).Hemorrhagic complications were higher in the embolization group than in the SRS group, although this difference did not reach statistical significance after PSM (13.2% vs 2.6%; OR=5.6; 95% CI 0.62 to 50.47; P=0.12). Similarly, re-treatment rate was higher in the embolization group (10.5% vs 5.3%; OR=2.11; 95% CI 0.36 to 12.31; P=0.40) compared with the SRS group. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that SRS has a significantly higher obliteration rate at last follow-up compared with endovascular embolization. Also, SRS has a higher tendency for fewer hemorrhagic complications and lower re-treatment rate. Further prospective studies are needed.",2025 Jan 27,2025,Journal of neurointerventional surgery,,,,eng,True,jnis-2024-022326;10.1136/jnis-2024-022326;jnis-2024-022326;10.1136/jnis-2024-022326,Journal Article,,Arteriovenous Malformation

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of all deep AVMs treated at our institution between 1997 and 2011 with attention to patient selection, treatment strategies, and radiographic and functional outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 97 patients underwent initial treatment at our institution. 64% presented with hemorrhage with 29% located in the basal ganglia, 41% in the thalamus, and 30% in the insula. 80% were Spetzler-Martin grade III-IV. Initial treatment was microsurgical resection in 42%, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in 45%, and observation in 12%. Radiographic cure was achieved in 54% after initial surgical or SRS treatment (71% and 23%, respectively) and in 63% after subsequent treatments, with good functional outcomes in 78% (median follow-up 2.2 years). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed treatment group and age as factors associated with radiographic cure, whereas Spetzler-Martin score and time to follow-up were significantly associated with improved/unchanged functional status at time of last follow-up. Posttreatment hemorrhage occurred in 11% (7% of surgical and 18% of SRS patients). CONCLUSIONS: Modern treatment of deep AVMs includes a multidisciplinary approach utilizing microsurgery, SRS, embolization, and observation. Supplementary grading adds meaningfully to traditional Spetzler-Martin grading to guide patient selection. Surgical resection is more likely to result in obliteration compared with SRS, and is associated with satisfactory results in carefully selected patients.",2014 Sep-Oct,2014,World neurosurgery,82,3-4,386-94,eng,True,S1878-8750(14)00281-2;10.1016/j.wneu.2014.03.033;S1878-8750(14)00281-2;10.1016/j.wneu.2014.03.033,"Journal Article;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",Adolescent;Adult;Basal Ganglia/pathology/*surgery;Central Nervous System Vascular Malformations/pathology/*surgery;Cerebral Cortex/pathology/*surgery;Combined Modality Therapy;Female;Humans;Male;Microsurgery/methods;Middle Aged;Patient Selection;Radiosurgery;Thalamus/pathology/*surgery;Treatment Outcome;Watchful Waiting;Young Adult,Arteriovenous malformations;Basal ganglia;Radiosurgery;Surgery;Thalamus;Therapeutic embolization
15335419,Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for the treatment of large arteriovenous malformations with or without previous partial embolization.,"OBJECTIVE: Despite the success of stereotactic radiosurgery, large inoperable arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of 14 cm(3) or more have remained largely refractory to stereotactic radiosurgery, with much lower obliteration rates. We review treatment of large AVMs either previously untreated or partially obliterated by embolization with fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSR) regimens using a dedicated linear accelerator (LINAC). METHODS: Before treatment, all patients were discussed at a multidisciplinary radiosurgery board and found to be suitable for FSR. All patients were evaluated for pre-embolization. Those who had feeding pedicles amenable to glue embolization were treated. LINAC technique involved acquisition of a stereotactic angiogram in a relocatable frame that was also used for head localization during treatment. The FSR technique involved the use of six 7-Gy fractions delivered on alternate days over a 2-week period, and this was subsequently dropped to 5-Gy fractions after late complications in one of seven patients treated with 7-Gy fractions. Treatments were based exclusively on digitized biplanar stereotactic angiographic data. We used a Varian 600SR LINAC (Varian Medical Systems, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) and XKnife treatment planning software (Radionics, Inc., Burlington, MA). In most cases, one isocenter was used, and conformality was established by non-coplanar arc beam shaping and differential beam weighting. RESULTS: Thirty patients with large AVMs were treated between January 1995 and August 1998. Seven patients were treated with 42-Gy/7-Gy fractions, with one patient lost to follow-up and the remaining six with previous partial embolization. Twenty-three patients were treated with 30-Gy/5-Gy fractions, with two patients lost to follow-up and three who died as a result of unrelated causes. Of 18 evaluable patients, 8 had previous partial embolization. Mean AVM volumes at FSR treatment were 23.8 and 14.5 cm(3), respectively, for the 42-Gy/7-Gy fraction and 30-Gy/5-Gy fraction groups. After embolization, 18 patients still had AVM niduses of 14 cm(3) or more: 6 in the 7-Gy cohort and 12 in the 5-Gy cohort. For patients with at least 5-year follow-up, angiographically documented AVM obliteration rates were 83% for the 42-Gy/7-Gy fraction group, with a mean latency of 108 weeks (5 of 6 evaluable patients), and 22% for the 30-Gy/5-Gy fraction group, with an average latency of 191 weeks (4 of 18 evaluable patients) (P = 0.018). For AVMs that remained at 14 cm(3) or more after embolization (5 of 6 patients), the obliteration rate remained 80% (4 of 5 patients) for the 7-Gy cohort and dropped to 9% for the 5-Gy cohort. A cumulative hazard plot revealed a 7.2-fold greater likelihood of obliteration with the 42-Gy/7-Gy fraction protocol (P = 0.0001), which increased to a 17-fold greater likelihood for postembolization AVMs of 14 cm(3) or more (P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: FSR achieves obliteration for AVMs at a threshold dose, including large residual niduses after embolization. With significant treatment-related morbidities, further investigation warrants a need for better three-dimensional target definition with higher dose conformality.",2004 Sep,2004,Neurosurgery,55,3,519-30; discussion 530-1,eng,True,10.1227/01.neu.0000134285.41701.83,Comparative Study;Journal Article,"Adult;Arteriovenous Malformations/diagnosis/*surgery;Cohort Studies;Combined Modality Therapy;Diagnostic Imaging;Embolization, Therapeutic;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care;Preoperative Care;Radiotherapy/*methods;Retrospective Studies",
